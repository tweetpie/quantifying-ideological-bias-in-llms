      "text": "Racist Trump Appointee Resigns After Audio Emerges of Him Claiming 'Black Race' Has 'Lax' Morality\n\nCarl Higbie, the chief of external affairs at the Corporation for National and Community Service, the federal government's volunteer services organization, resigned Thursday after CNN reported that he had made racist, sexist and xenophobic comments . Higbie was an appointee of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe 2013 comments reported by CNN were made on-air, drawing the Trump administration's employment vetting processes into question. Among the jaw-droppingly racist comments include some that express blatant anti-black bigotry.\n\n\"Only one (black) person was actually cordial to me,\" Higbie said in a 2013 radio appearance where he discussed giving away free firewood. \"Every other black person was rude. They wanted me to either load the wood, completely split it for them or some sort of you know assistance in labor. Now, mind you the ad was for free firewood, come take it all you want. And I believe that this translates directly into the culture that is breeding this welfare and the high percentage of people on welfare in the black race. It's a lack of morality.\"\n\nHigbie also said that black Americans who don't have citizenship in an African country can't be African American: \"[Y]ou're not both. I don't care what you think.\"\n\nHis prejudice extended well beyond his views on black people. \"I just don't like Muslim people,\" Higbie said in 2013. \"You know, I don't like gay people. I just don't,\" he said the same year.\n\n\"Effective immediately, Carl Higbie has resigned as Chief of External Affairs at CNCS,\" Samantha Jo Warfield, a spokesperson for CNCS, said after the comments were reported.\n\nQuestions about how Higbie got the job after making hateful remarks in public remain unanswered."

      "text": "How white supremacy prevented America from having single-payer healthcare\n\nIn the wake of the assassination of UnitedHealth CEO Brian Thompson, Americans are wondering out loud why we're getting ripped off by giant insurance companies when every other developed country in the world has healthcare as a right and pays an average of about half of what we do - and gets better outcomes.\n\nAs I point out in The Hidden History of American Healthcare: Why Sickness Bankrupts You and Makes Others Insanely Rich , and brought up with Joy Reid on her program last week, America is:\n\n- The only developed country in the world that doesn't recognize healthcare as a human right, - The only country with more than two-thirds of its population lacking access to affordable healthcare and a half-million families facing bankruptcy every year because somebody got sick, - The only country in the developed world where over 40% of the population carries $220 billion in medical debt, - And the only country in the developed world that has, since its founding, enslaved and then legally oppressed and disenfranchised a large minority of its population because of their race.\n\nThese things, along with UnitedHealth's $370 billion in revenue and $32 billion in profit , are connected.\n\nRoughly 60 percent of Americans would have had to take out a loan or otherwise borrow or beg for money to deal with a single, unexpected $1,000 expense.\n\nYet annual family medical copays and out -of-pocket deductibles averaged $6,575 in 2023, when the Kaiser Family Foundation did a comprehensive survey of Americans. This strikes minorities particularly hard, which, it turns out, is not an accident.\n\nThe simple fact is that, were it not for slavery, white supremacy, and the legacy of \"scientific racism,\" America would have had a national, single-payer healthcare system in 1915, just 31 years after Germany put into place the modern world's first such program.\n\nAt the center of the effort to prevent a national healthcare system - or any form of government assistance that may even incidentally offer benefit to African Americans - were Frederick Ludwig Hoffman and the Prudential Life Insurance Company, which promoted his \"science based\" racial theories to successfully fight single-payer health insurance.\n\nRacism is the main reason that America doesn't consider healthcare a human right and provide it to all citizens, in contrast to every other developed country in the world. Racist whites, particularly in the South, have worked for over a century to make sure that healthcare is hard for Black people and other minorities to get.\n\nAnd their biggest ally, their founding spokesperson in the post-Civil War era, their biggest champion right up to the 1940s, was a man that most Americans have never heard of.\n\nIn 1884, 19-year-old Frederick Ludwig Hoffmann left Germany for America after failing at a number of job attempts and being rejected for the German Army because he was \"physically deficient\" and frail, standing five-foot-seven and weighing a mere 110 pounds. He arrived in New York with $4.76 in his pocket, speaking \"not a word of English\" but determined to prove wrong his mother's assessment that he was a \"good-for-nothing.\"\n\nFrom this humble beginning, Hoffmann went on to become one of America's most influential statisticians and analysts of public health, making numerous consequential discoveries about how industrialization was killing American workers.\n\nHe dropped the last n in his last name, became so fluent in English that his accent was nearly indistinguishable, and married into an upscale Georgia family. By 1920 he was an American citizen, vice president of America's largest insurance company, and a national authority on the now-discredited pseudoscience called scientific racism .\n\nIn 1908, his article \"The Mortality from Consumption [tuberculosis] in the Dusty Trades,\" published by the US Department of Labor, produced the first national efforts to reduce lung damage in the workplace. He also published the first work (1915) linking tobacco to lung cancer.\n\nFrom this, he became vice president of the National Tuberculosis Association (today known as the American Lung Association) and later demonstrated the connection between exposure to asbestos and the disease that killed my father, mesothelioma (a bit of data that asbestos companies worked to keep hidden for the next 80 years).\n\nBut Hoffman's most controversial lifelong obsession was with the relationship between disease, race, and society.\n\nOn one of his first trips to Georgia, he wrote, he came across a book by Dr. Eugene R. Corson, a Georgia obstetrician, titled The Vital Equation of the Colored Race and Its Future in the United States . It was apparently an updated or shortened version of Corson's widely read \"The Future of the Colored Race in the United States From an Ethnic and Medical Standpoint,\" published in 1887 in the New York Medical Times .\n\nThis was just after the failure of Reconstruction, and a widespread topic of speculation, particularly in the South, was whether Black people would soon outnumber white people in that part of the country.\n\nThe Ku Klux Klan and others calling for wholesale slaughter and suppression of Black people claimed that they were more likely to have larger families because they were \"more prolific,\" code for \"excessively sexual,\" a charge that had persisted from the earliest days of slavery and led to the murder of Emmett Till (among others).\n\nHowever, the \"scientific\" racists of the day, like Corson, thought differently. Corson led a movement suggesting that people of African ancestry, now lacking \"the protective womb of slavery,\" would die out for the simple reason that the Black race was \"inferior to whites.\"\n\nCorson promoted the Klan's argument that \"the simpler the organism, the simpler the genesis and the greater the prolificness.\" But, he said, white people would prevail because they were less likely to die of disease, citing Herbert Spencer's Theory of Population Deduced from the General Law of Animal Fertility .\n\nWhile Black people might have more children, Corson wrote, white people would still outnumber them because Black fecundity \"is more than compensated for by the ability [of white people] to maintain individual life.\"\n\nEnslaved people from Africa had found themselves in a civilization \"of which [they are] not a product\" and thus were less likely to be successful in \"the struggle for existence.\" Therefore, Corson wrote, Black people \"must suffer physically, a result which forbids any undue increase in the race.\"\n\nThe discovery of this theory, called the racial extinction thesis , electrified Hoffman, and he spent the rest of his life promoting it, while campaigning to stop any sort of movement toward a national health insurance program that might prevent or slow down the extinction of Black people in America.\n\nIn August 1896, the American Economic Association published a book that represented a turning point in Frederick Hoffman's life and sealed the fate of single-payer health insurance in America. It was Hoffman's magnum opus, summarizing decades of compiled statistics on Black versus white mortality, proving, according to Hoffman, once and for all, that for Black people, \"gradual extinction is only a question of time.\"\n\nIn Race Traits and Tendencies of the American Negro , Hoffman set out not only to repeatedly make and statistically prove the above claim, but also to prove that anytime white people tried to help Black people, particularly by offering them healthcare services, the result was disaster for both.\n\nIn great detail, Hoffman spent about 300 pages documenting, with exhaustive tables and statistics, the fact that Black people were more likely to die as a result of everything from malaria to tuberculosis to childbirth.\n\nAnd it was all because of their race, Hoffman argued:\n\nAnd that represented a danger to white people, Hoffman wrote.\n\nSlavery had actually been good for Black people, Hoffman believed, and the abolition of slavery at the end of the Civil War was only going to speed up the demise of that race.\n\nWhile Hoffman pioneered linking causal conditions such as asbestos and carcinogen exposure to sickness, he was so blinded by racism that a modern reader of his book constantly finds himself shouting, \"But these things are also true of poor whites! These are caused by discrimination and poverty!!\"\n\nAt the time, though, the vast majority of white Americans agreed with him. He was echoing the white cultural and scientific consensus of the late 19th and early 20th centuries when he wrote:\n\nAnd, according to Hoffman and the other white \"scientific racists,\" the problem wasn't just physical inferiority. The deepest \"problem of the Negro,\" Hoffman wrote, was moral:\n\nFor those well-intentioned white people who wanted to help out the people who were a mere generation or two away from slavery, Hoffman and his colleagues had one simple bit of advice: Don't even try .\n\nIn 1980, David Koch famously ran for vice president of the United States under the banner of the Libertarian Party , an organization founded a few decades earlier by big business to give an economic rationale and political patina to their simple theory that economics were more important than democracy, and the quality of life of working people should be decided in the \"free marketplace\" instead of by unions or through democratic processes via government regulation.\n\nIn this, Koch and his Libertarian friends were echoing Frederick Hoffman.\n\nIn his 1896 book Race Traits , Hoffman laid out his \"scientific\" assertion that when government steps in to help people, it invariably ends up hurting them instead. Not only should there be no government assistance given to help African Americans recover from three centuries of property theft, forced labor, and legal violence, but it is scientifically wrong to even consider the idea.\n\nWhite people and government programs to better the lives of Black people, Hoffman wrote, deserve \"the most severe condemnation of modern attempts of superior races to lift inferior races to their own elevated position.\"\n\nThe damage done to Black people by offering them any sort of help, government assistance, or even a minimum wage, he wrote, is \"criminal\" behavior for a \"civilized people.\"\n\nHoffman pointed to Native Americans to prove his point:\n\nBut it was government help, Hoffman wrote, that destroyed the American Indian.\n\nIt wasn't \"adulterated whiskey nor the frightful consequences of sexual immorality, spread around the forts and settlements of the whites,\" that was \"sufficient\" to destroy Native Americans. It was charity.\n\nWhite Americans rationalized their brutality toward Native Americans and African Americans by saying that it was simple evolutionary biology: only the strong survive, and when the weak are allowed to propagate, it weakens the overall human race.\n\nAnd it's not just charity.\n\nFree education - as any Libertarian can tell you - is more dangerous to the souls of people than slavery. And free healthcare is even worse.\n\nSounding like a modern-day acolyte of Ayn Rand, Hoffman wrote:\n\nAnd, like Ayn Rand, David Koch, and Ronald Reagan, Hoffman believed that these were eternal truths independent of race:\n\nThis libertarian ideal is still pervasive in our modern fragmented healthcare system, and in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis in 2020 it resulted in thousands of daily American deaths, disproportionately hitting racial minorities.\n\nThe \"compulsory health insurance\" (what today we'd call Medicare for All) movement of the early 20th century was as much (and possibly more) about getting paid sick leave as it was about covering doctor visits and hospitalization, because healthcare was so cheap that an unpaid week at work was a bigger hit to the wallet.\n\nBut workers wanted both.\n\nThe most successful effort of the era came out of an organization that a small group of progressive economists put together in 1905 and 1906, known as the American Association for Labor Legislation (AALL).\n\nTheir initial efforts were directed at paid sick leave, workers' compensation insurance, child labor laws, and workplace safety standards. To that last end, they were actively using the kinds of statistical analysis that Frederick Hoffman had both used and popularized to do everything from laying out his theories on race to showing an association between tobacco use and lung cancer.\n\nHoffman joined the AALL to promote their efforts...at least that was his claim.\n\nA charitable reading of his motivations was that his statistical research on workplace phosphorus poisoning and lung disease overlapped with their efforts, and they were an organization that, at that time, was held in high regard. He did, after all, consider himself - and was, in a very real way - a major force for reform in public health and workplace safety arenas.\n\nA less charitable motivation is posited in Daniel T. Rodgers's 1998 book Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age . Rodgers wrote:\n\nDespite Prudential and Hoffman's efforts, government-funded health insurance was gaining popularity in America (and being adopted across Europe).\n\nIn 1912, Theodore Roosevelt made a third-party bid for the presidency, forming the Progressive Party (with its Bull Moose logo), and called for \"the protection of home life against the hazards of sickness, irregular employment and old age through the adoption of a system of social insurance.\"\n\nJane Addams (Hull House founder), dressed in suffragette white, seconded Roosevelt's nomination to wild cheers and applause; Roosevelt rallies routinely drew tens of thousands of people, and more than 200,000 people showed up in Los Angeles to support him and the party.\n\nRoosevelt's endorsement of \"social insurance,\" including health coverage, both reflected and reinforced a growing national sentiment, and in 1915 the AALL called for every state to support a program of health insurance. Prudential hadn't yet gotten into the business of insuring health (they would in 1925), but they could see the writing on the wall.\n\nIn 1916, the AALL endorsed health insurance provided through a network of local and statewide mutual companies and called for those policies to also provide a small death benefit to cover funeral costs, which would have competed directly with the funeral coverage that was Prudential's main cash cow.\n\nHoffman wrote to the company, \"We, of course, cannot compete with Compulsory Insurance, including a death benefit of, say $100.\" He then resigned \"in disgust\" from the AALL and begin a campaign, sponsored by Prudential, to stop state-funded health insurance.\n\nHoffman and Prudential weren't alone in their concern: the Insurance Federation of New York told their members:\n\nThe AALL produced model legislation that was taken up in 1916 by eight states, including California and New York, the former via a ballot initiative and the latter in the New York legislature. In addition to calling for policies that would pay all costs of healthcare, the AALL's legislation called for up to 26 weeks of paid sick leave.\n\nPicking up steam, the American Medical Association endorsed the AALL's model legislation as well. The battle was joined.\n\nHoffman's Prudential-sponsored campaign to prevent any state from adopting a statewide nonprofit health (and death benefit) insurance program went into overdrive through 1916-1920. He traveled to Germany several times to chronicle, in minute detail, the failings of the kaiser's system that had been operating since 1885.\n\nPrudential, in 1905, had been swept up in New York's Armstrong Investigation, and so, as historian Beatrix Hoffman (no relation to Frederick) wrote , \"[b]ecause of their industry's public image problems, insurance executives knew their opposition to compulsory health insurance would be perceived as brazen self-interest.\"\n\nThey needed a front man, and the guy who was famous for discovering the causes of numerous public health crises was perfect. Thus, Frederick Hoffman became the most well-known face of a massive, multiyear effort to stop the AALL's campaign. He was remarkably effective.\n\nIn the years between 1916, when he resigned from AALL, and 1920, when nonprofit state-funded health insurance finally died, Hoffman wrote numerous pamphlets trashing the German single-payer government health system, \"exposing\" corruption in the British efforts at a National Health Service, and arguing that America's healthcare system would be thrown into chaos and crisis if the AALL's programs were adopted.\n\nHis work was widely distributed, as historian Daniel Rodgers noted: \"The Prudential saturated the state capitols with his pamphlets.\"\n\nHis 1917 pamphlet Facts and Fallacies of Compulsory Health Insurance , and the subsequent More Facts and Fallacies of Compulsory Health Insurance , published two years later, were his most widely cited and most consequential writings.\n\nHistorian Beatrix Hoffman wrote that the Facts pamphlet \"resembled Race Traits and Tendencies in its impressive presentation of statistics and graphs alongside passionate polemics.\" Frederick Hoffman refuted every figure the Progressives used in defense of their plan, from \"Misleading Data on German Longevity\" to \"Misleading Estimate of Cost\" and \"Disregard of Actuarial Methods.\"\n\nAppealing to the Daniel Boone mythos of rugged, independent individualism that didn't require assistance from government, Frederick Hoffman wrote in More Facts and Fallacies of Compulsory Health Insurance :\n\nHoffman's writing and speeches shook America's political systems, particularly as this German-born \"man of science\" warned of the dire consequences to American liberty and democracy represented by universal health insurance.\n\nIn 1918, John R. Commons - one of the AALL's cofounders - wrote that almost all the nation's anti-compulsory health insurance propaganda \"originates from one source; all of the ammunition, all of the facts and statistics that may come across, no matter who gives them to you, will be found to go back to the Prudential Insurance Co. of America, and to Mr. Frederick L. Hoffman.\"\n\nPrudential paid to transport Hoffman all across America, from media events to congressional hearings to a trip to England to document the horrors of their National Health Service system, which had gone into effect in 1911.\n\nHe wrote from London, in a widely read paper, that because of the British National Insurance Act, \"The fine spirit of the English working classes, at one time the finest people of that type in the world, is gone, entirely gone.\"\n\nHistorian Beatrix Hoffman wrote:\n\nIn 1920, in large part because of Prudential's efforts and Hoffman's warnings, California's voters resoundingly turned down a voter initiative in that state to provide health insurance, and, although New York's Senate passed the bill, it died in committee in the Assembly.\n\nWhile the AALL continued to campaign for state-funded health insurance until their dissolution in 1946, they never again gained enough traction to get their proposal before any state legislatures or the US Congress.\n\nHaving succeeded in killing state-funded health insurance, Hoffman, in the later 1920s, turned his attention back to his theory that Black people would eventually die out, joining the Eugenics Research Association (whose work was later used by Hitler to justify racial separation and his \"final solution\").\n\nIn 1929, Hoffman asserted, in the African American publication Opportunity , that \"the white race is almost solely responsible . . . for the health progress which the South has made during the last generation\" and that Black people moving in large numbers into cities would \"lead to a thoroughly unwholesome state of affairs which unquestionably will express itself in course of time in a lower birth rate and a higher death rate.\"\n\nHoffman's influence lasted long past his death in 1946 (which satisfied his stated desire to live long enough to see FDR out of office). As late as 1984, according to reporting in the Wall Street Journal , Prudential was still collecting premiums from African Americans that were \"in some instances more than a third higher\" than those paid by whites.\n\nWe even see an echo of it in the opposition of southern white racist Senators to Medicare in 1965, arguably leading to the 20% hole in that system that requires MediGap policies to fill.\n\nWere it not for \"scientific racism,\" America would have long ago joined the rest of the developed world with a competent and efficient national healthcare system. Instead, we're stuck with for-profit health insurance giants sucking our blood like giant leeches attached to our backs.\n\nNOW READ: Inside the DOGE billionaires' plan to kill Medicare"

      "text": "The Cornel West-Ta-Nehisi Coates Spat Is the Last Thing We Need Right Now\n\nTerry pulled up on me at the car wash like, \"Yooooooooooo!\"\n\n\"Nas just ended Jay!\" he said. \"Did you hear 'Ether?'\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" I replied. \"You can't end Jay-Z. God doesn't work like that.\"\n\nTerry brushed a stack of untitled bootleg CDs off of his passenger seat, and I sat down and witnessed history. I say history, because nobody knew that Nas would deliver one of the most compelling dis tracks ever­­ - most thought the Queens emcee was done after Jay-Z's \"The Takeover.\" But they were all wrong. Nas' comeback was biblical. He was David putting the heaviest rock on the planet inside his sling and slapping Goliath - Jay-Z and the Rockafella empire - in a way that changed hip hop forever.\n\nNas didn't finish Jay like Terry said, but he rebooted his career with that track, and left us with the term, \"I ethered you!\" Being ethered means that you were basically destroyed to the point of no return. Over the weekend Cornel West, who many call the most important living black intellectual, tried to ether Ta-Nehisi Coates, who many also call the most important living black intellectual, in The Guardian, claiming, \" Ta-Nehisi Coates is the neoliberal face of the black freedom struggle .\"\n\n\"The disagreement between Coates and me is clear. Any analysis or vision of our world that omits the centrality of Wall Street power, US military policies, and the complex dynamics of class, gender, and sexuality in black America is too narrow and dangerously misleading. So, it is with Ta-Nehisi Coates' worldview.\n\nCoates rightly highlights the vicious legacy of white supremacy - past and present. He sees it everywhere and ever reminds us of its plundering effects. Unfortunately, he hardly keeps track of our fightback, and never connects this ugly legacy to the predatory capitalist practices, imperial policies (of war, occupation, detention, assassination) or the black elite's refusal to confront poverty, patriarchy or transphobia.\"\n\nCoates clapped back on Twitter, defending his work and highlighting the times he addressed the issues on which West accused him of being quiet. Today, the Associated Press reports Coates has deleted his account, writing, \"I didn't get in it for this.\"\n\nThe public rift between Coates and West dates back to 2015, when Coates dropped his book \"Between The World and Me,\" which went on to win the National Book Award. The book lifted Coates' status from popular writer to America's number one go-to guy on issues dealing with race - Cornel West's old job. Toni Morrison wrote of Coates in her blurb for the book:\n\nI've been wondering who might fill the intellectual void that plagued me after James Baldwin died. Clearly it is Ta-Nehisi Coates. The language of Between the World and Me, like Coates's journey, is visceral, eloquent, and beautifully redemptive. And its examination of the hazards and hopes of black male life is as profound as it is revelatory. This is required reading.\n\nWest disagreed with Morrison at the time, on Facebook: \"Baldwin was a great writer of profound courage who spoke truth to power. Coates is a clever wordsmith with journalistic talent who avoids any critique of the Black president in power.\" This launched the feud.\n\nThe internet split - some sided with Coates, others with West - just like we did with the feud between Nas and Jay. New Yorker writer and Columbia University journalism professor Jelani Cobb had the most aggressive response.\n\nThe back and forth was fun to watch, but Coates didn't get ethered by West. Actually Cobb kind of ethered West, and in the end, it seems Nas and Jay had a more relevant beef than this. Two intellectual giants threw a lot of bullets but nobody really got hit. Both Coates and West made extremely valid points, as they always do - smart people normally do make good points, but now what? How does this transfer into anything that will help the poor, disenfranchised and incarcerated people who were brought up by both of them? I'll answer: It won't.\n\nThe Nas and Jay feud was superior for a number of reasons. They were both respected immensely by the people they represented. Fans from all over can quote whole Jay and Nas albums, word for word. Most kids in poverty, and that aforementioned incarcerated population - especially the ones I service in east Baltimore - have never heard of West nor Coates. They don't read The Atlantic or The Guardian. And hip hop is an art form based on entertainment, while Coates and West are documenting, reporting and dealing with real lives. Now Coates did write the brilliant \" Case for Reparations ,\" a great piece of writing that should influence policy some way, and I don't think West can boast a comparable feat in recent memory, though I haven't read his complete body of work. But the most amazing ideas that can actually benefit African-Americans normally get swallowed by systemic racism, and both of these scholars have made careers out of explaining this.\n\nThe works of both Coates and West are solely based on the lives of real people who they write about or speak for - brilliantly - but to whom they never really have to be accountable. I don't know what good works they do personally, or who they donate to,­­ so I'm not passing judgment. However, providing receipts or listing quantifiable goals that have been met would instantly silence this whole beef that shouldn't even exist in the first place. This leads me to the most important point: There's no leader of the black race.\n\nI consider myself to be a student of both West and Coates, but they aren't my leaders. I've never met them, would never answer to them, I can't call them, their work is too complex for the reading level of many of the adults I work with, and they've not stepped foot in my community­­ - and I wouldn't expect them to. There are leaders all over the country doing amazing work; the days of everybody praising one Dr. King type is over. There are so many black voices, and we all speak for ourselves. We all matter.\n\nWest has to understand that Coates is a writer­­, not a boots-on-the-ground activist, not a politician, not a professional protester nor an anarchist. He does research, he has big ideas that are obviously worth a lot of money, and he writes. He never claimed to be anything else, and his work is important. We need it. Just like we need West to articulate these complex issues dealing with race to Bill Maher and the Ivy League kids he teaches, who will eventually graduate and inherit the companies that oppress neighborhoods like mine.\n\nMaybe West's teachings will or have saved some black neighborhood from being gentrified because he gave some reformed-racist rich kid an A. The fact is that wars are fought on all fronts, and we need like minds to be represented everywhere - from the court rooms and on the ground to classrooms and in law enforcement.\n\nThere's no need for West to try to ether Coates. He didn't create the oppressive systems that hinder people of color; he just makes money talking about them. The only thing Coates may be guilty of is taking liberal money out of West's pockets, and if that's the real issue, Dr. West, write about that .\n\nTo the people who dream of being the leader of the black race or having a monopoly on the extremely complex black experience: Put your money where you mouth is it, create some jobs, and go and help some real people."

      "text": "United States of Amnesia: What White America Doesn't Understand About the Baltimore Protests\n\nBaltimore's young people responded to the police theft of Freddie Gray's life with protests that eventually grew into a spasm of violence. While the direct motivator, Gray's death is not the only direct cause of the uprising. The protests and violent exhalations by Baltimore's black youth (and others) are the result of a long pattern of police abuse, harassment and violence toward that city's African-American community in the context of systemic class inequality, custodial citizenship and mass incarceration.\n\nThe causes of black urban unrest in the United States are not \"unknown unknowns.\" Rather, they were described in great and compelling detail by the 1968 Kerner Commission, which was tasked by President Johnson with determining the causes of the urban riots during the 1960s.\n\nThe reasons young people in Baltimore and other parts of the United States have been moved to street protests in response to police violence are only mysteries to those American policymakers and members of the public who choose to live in a state of denial.\n\n(White) America is a country with a limited historical perspective and a very short-term memory. As Gore Vidal famously said, \"We live here in the United States of Amnesia. No one remembers anything before Monday morning. Everything is a blank. They have no history.\"\n\nThus, the American people are robbed of any meaningful social or historical context for the police abuse in Baltimore, Ferguson, and the many other locales where police thuggery and state violence are routinely visited upon black and brown Americans, as well as the poor and the mentally ill, with relative impunity.\n\nWhite riots and pogroms against Black Americans are a fixture of American history. But the corporate news media enables many white Americans' intentional forgetting and mass amnesia.\n\nHere, the uprising and righteous anger of black young people in Baltimore (and elsewhere) is almost by default described as a riot. Deeper questions about class inequality and racism are removed from the dominant media frame and replaced by tired, trite and profoundly unsophisticated claims that the uprising in Baltimore was caused by absent black fathers, broken homes and an urban culture of poverty and violence. In everything but name, Baltimore's black youth have been branded by the news media and American opinion leaders as feral street urchins: this is the language of racialization and dehumanization.\n\nMany Americans in the news media and elsewhere are reluctant to acknowledge how the angry and violent response by Baltimore's young people against the illegitimate, cruel and repeated acts of police brutality and killings in their community could be logical and wholly reasonable-and solidly within the American political tradition.\n\nThe White Racial Frame-a system of belief that legitimizes and normalizes white dominance and privilege in North American society-has produced the language of \"riots,\" \"black pathology,\" \"thugs,\" and \"criminals\" that is commonly used to describe the Baltimore uprising. The White Racial Frame does the work of white supremacy and helps to maintain political, social and economic systems of white privilege and unearned advantages. The White Racial Frame also distorts historical fact by erasing America's long tradition of white-on-black violence across the colorline.\n\nThe language of \"riots\" to describe \"urban unrest\" as something unique to black Americans is a relatively recent phenomenon, one that can be traced back to iconic images of burning cities in the aftermath of Dr. King's assassination and the tumult of the 1960s. But the use of phrases such as \"riot\" or \"mob\" can also be seen in the latter part of the 19th and early 20th centuries to legitimize mass white racial violence against black Americans during the era of Jim and Jane Crow. Newspapers such as the New York Times featured headlines such as \"Mobs of Blacks Retaliate for Riots\"; \"Negro Mob Terrorizing the Citizens of Jacksonville\"; \"Negro Mob in South Shouts for Lynching\"; and \"Negro Mob Killed Sheriff.\"\n\nThe racist news narrative continues in the present, where the urban uprising against police violence and brutality in Baltimore has been described by right-wing propaganda sites such as the Drudge Report and other media outlets as a \"race war\" and/or \"anti-white\" violence.\n\nIn fact, in the United States, \"rioting\" and \"race wars\" against people of color are almost exclusively the domain of white Americans.\n\nDuring the 1863 New York City draft riots, white people ran amok, killing black Americans and destroying the African-American community's churches, orphanages, businesses and schools.\n\nIn 1921, over a 24-hour time period, whites destroyed the prosperous black community in Tulsa, Oklahoma. White rioters used machine guns and dropped bombs (in what may be one of the first recorded uses of a plane for that purpose) on the black community. Conservative estimates suggest that at least several h undred black people were killed.\n\nIn East Saint Louis, whites engaged in a pogrom against the bl ack community . Like Chicago, this was part of the \"Red Summers\" in which whites attempted to reassert their control and dominance over the black community in the aftermath of World War I.\n\nScholars such a s James Loewen estimate that as many as 3,000 black communities were \"ethnically cleansed\" by white violence and other means of intimidation\n\nHistorian Gregory Downs has suggested that as many as 50,000 black Americans were killed by white racial terrorism in the 30 years following the end of the American Civil War. This total may not even include at least 4,000 blacks who were victims of lynchings by whites across the South and other parts of the United States.\n\nAs the late Joel Olsen described in The Abolition of White Democracy, white riots against black Americans and other people of color were a way of creating a sense of communal identity across lines of class and ethnicity. Thus, \"whiteness\" was nurtured and in many ways created by white violence against non-whites generally, and African Americans in particular.\n\nWhite riots and other types of mass violence against the black community enriched white Americans through land theft, the destruction of black businesses and as a way of enforcing a regime of racial terrorism that economically and politically oppressed the black community in such as a way as to directly (and indirectly) fill white America's coffers.\n\nBy most empirical measures (land taken, people killed and number of occurrences-there were 26 white-on-black race riots during the year 1919 alone) white Americans are the country's most successful, adept and skilled rioters. White America is an expert on rioting and race wars; black America is a neophyte amateur with little to no experience in such matters by comparison.\n\nNevertheless, the corporate news media has recycled Ronald Reagan's and the Republican Party's language of \"law and order\" and \"black pathology,\" and obsess over images of black young people \"rioting\" against the Baltimore police. Many in the corporate news media will also emphasize what they believe is wrong with the \"black family,\" \"black culture,\" and the black community's supposed inability to \"control\" young black people in the aftermath of the Baltimore uprising.\n\nThe right-wing media and its politicians will heavily emphasize this narrative. Fox News host Bill O'Reilly told his viewers that:\n\n\"The facts then dictate that racial persecution really isn't the problem in Baltimore. Something else is in play. And that something else is personal behavior...These idiotic thugs who are rioting and looting are hurting their own people, and because the entire world sees pictures of blacks rampaging, all African Americans are affected...It is long past time for police agencies in America to have a no tolerance policy towards brutality on the part of officers...But it is also long past time for African-American communities across America to begin to police themselves.\"\n\nRepublican 2016 presidential candidate Rand Paul suggested that the Baltimore uprising was caused by absent black fathers:\n\n\"The thing is that really there's so many things we can talk about, it's something we talk about not in the immediate aftermath but over time: the breakdown of the family structure, the lack of fathers, the lack of sort of a moral code in our society. And this isn't just a racial thing, it goes across racial boundaries, but we do have problems in our country.\"\n\nPaul's and O'Reilly's comments are part of what is known as the Southern strategy, which was created by the Republican Party in the aftermath of the civil rights movement with the goal of using white racial resentment and anti-black and brown bias to win over white working- and middle-class voters.\n\nHowever, much more important questions will not be asked by pundits and politicians.\n\nHow are America's police pathological in their violence, racism and brutal killings of black people?\n\nAre America's police deranged in how they imagine unarmed black and brown people as some type of imminent threat to be dispatched with due haste and extreme prejudice?\n\nIs America's police culture sick and pathological in how citizens have been tortured to death, sexually assaulted and otherwise violated and abused by police officers?\n\nIf there are only a few bad apples in America's police departments, why don't the good cops throw them out en masse?\n\nAre America's police more like a street gang than public servants?\n\nIt is easy for the mainstream news media to opine and lecture about \"pathological\" black communities that are supposedly plagued by \"bad culture.\" It is far more difficult to talk about America's broken police and its culture of violence and disrespect toward non-whites and poor people that led to the killing of Freddie Gray in Baltimore, and so many other black men and women across the United States of America."

      "text": "Who Needs Black History Month?\n\nDuring an interview with Mike Wallace on \"60 Minutes\" last month, Academy Award winning actor Morgan Freeman called Black History month \"ridiculous,\" igniting a firestorm of debate about its observance. Freeman told a visibly shocked Wallace, \"I don't want a Black History month. Black History is American History. There's no white history month.\" Since Freeman's statements became public, I have read numerous editorials written by black intellectuals calling for the end of the celebration of black history month. The premise is that Black History month is no longer necessary, and that a 28 day observance both confines and trivializes the historic contributions of African-Americans in this country. Prior to even thinking about what Freeman was saying, I had to first get over my continued outrage at white people asking black actors, athletes, and entertainers what they think about issues that are outside of their areas of expertise. Publicizing the opinions of Morgan Freeman doesn't make him a spokesman for the black race. I don't see anyone seeking out Robert DeNiro for opinions about Iraq, but that's a whole different discussion. But in response to Freeman's comments, all I can say is, \"Please.\" Celebrating Black History Month no more confines the history of African-Americans than the one day MLK holiday confines the achievements of Dr. Martin Luther King. Or that St. Patrick's Day confines the history of Irish-Americans to March 17th. Want to know how to trivialize African-American history? Eliminate Black History Month. Mr. Freeman and others maintain that in place of Black History Month, black history should be incorporated into the mainstream history of America. Their thought process is that black history can be celebrated every day by its proper inclusion in American history. Mr. Freeman went so far as to ask Mike Wallace, \"Which month is white history month?\" The answer unfortunately, is that every month remains white history month in this country, and it is precisely for this reason that Black History month remains relevant and necessary. Sylvia Cyrus-Albritton, director of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History, (which originated the observance of what is now Black History Month), points out that the country still has a long way to go in making its history inclusive. As she told the Baltimore Sun in December: \"We have a mission to research, promote, preserve and disseminate information about the contributions of African-Americans in history and their diaspora,\" she said. \"When that mission is complete, maybe celebrations like Black History Month can take a different slant. American history books -- and the way it is taught -- still [do] not include the full contribution of African-Americans or other minorities for that matter. \"Dr. Woodson hoped that one day there would no longer be a need for Black History Month because it would be incorporated into American history all year round. So the goal Morgan Freeman speaks of is our goal as well.\" In some ways, I can understand where Freeman is coming from. Ideally, we wouldn't have to have a special month because American history would be inclusive of all history. Freeman, however, also seems to be advocating that we shouldn't even speak of our differences. Instead, we should just pretend that not only is everyone equal, but that we are the same. When Mike Wallace asked Freeman how we can get rid of racism, he replied: \"Stop talking about it. I'm going to stop calling you a white man. And I'm going to ask you to stop calling me a black man. I know you as Mike Wallace. You know me as Morgan Freeman. You wouldn't say, 'Well, I know this white guy named Mike Wallace.' You know what I'm sayin?\" I don't know about you, but I simply cannot agree with Freeman. We will not solve racial issues in this country by putting our collective heads in the sand and hoping they will go away. We can't run from our own racial past and delude ourselves that everything is ok in America. Our society still remains segregated in many ways, from where we live and where we worship, to who survives a hurricane. We like to think that we are a society beyond racism, but reality doesn't bear that out. Race is America's great taboo, and the fact is that there are differences -- cultural and physical -- between people of different races. We need to acknowledge those differences. Pretending like they don't exist is ignoring the elephant in the room. Mike Wallace is a white guy. Morgan Freeman is a black guy. Why ignore the facts? It's been said that history is written by the victors. Until American history becomes more inclusive of the contributions of all its citizens, Black History Month remains one of the few tangible ways that we can keep our nation's history accurate. Who needs Black History Month? We all do."

      "text": "Is 'scientific racism' why America has no universal healthcare system?\n\nFormer Olympic gold medalist Mary Lou Retton is struggling to pay her medical bills and has opened up a GoFundMe page to collect donations. How can this be happening in the wealthiest nation in the world?\n\nAmerica is the only developed country in the world that doesn't recognize healthcare as a human right, the only country with more than two-thirds of its population lacking access to affordable healthcare, and the only country in the developed world that has, since its founding, continuously enslaved and legally oppressed and disenfranchised a large minority of its population because of their race.\n\nThese things are connected.\n\nRoughly 60 percent of Americans would have had to take out a loan or otherwise borrow or beg for money to deal with a single, unexpected $1,000 expense. [i]\n\nYet copays and deductibles when a person gets sick averaged $1,318 in 2015, when the Kaiser Family Foundation did a comprehensive survey of Americans, up from $548 just 10 years earlier. [ii] This strikes minorities particularly hard, which, it turns out, is not an accident.\n\nThe simple fact is that, were it not for slavery, white supremacy, and the legacy of \"scientific racism,\" America would have had a national, single-payer healthcare system in 1915, just 31 years after Germany put into place the modern world's first such program.\n\nAt the center of the effort to prevent a national healthcare system-or any form of government assistance that may even incidentally offer benefit to African Americans-were Frederick Ludwig Hoffman and the Prudential Life Insurance Company, which promoted his \"science based\" racial theories to successfully fight single-payer health insurance.\n\nRacism is the main reason that America doesn't consider healthcare a human right and provide it to all citizens, as does every other developed country in the world. Racist whites, particularly in the South, have worked for over a century to make sure that healthcare is hard for Black people and other minorities to get.\n\nAnd their biggest ally, their founding spokesperson in the post-Civil War era, their biggest champion right up to the 1940s, was a man that most Americans have never heard of.\n\nIn 1884, 19-year-old Frederick Ludwig Hoffmann left Germany for America after failing at a number of job attempts and being rejected for the German Army because he was \"physically deficient\" and frail, standing five-foot-seven and weighing a mere 110 pounds. He arrived in New York with $4.76 in his pocket, speaking \"not a word of English\" but determined to prove wrong his mother's assessment that he was a \"good-for-nothing.\" [iii]\n\nFrom this humble beginning, Hoffmann went on to become one of America's most influential statisticians and analysts of public health, making numerous consequential discoveries about how industrialization was killing American workers.\n\nHe dropped the last n in his last name, became so fluent in English that his accent was nearly indistinguishable, and married into an upscale Georgia family. By 1920, he was an American citizen, vice president of America's largest insurance company, and a national authority on the now-discredited pseudoscience called scientific racism.\n\nIn 1908, his article \"The Mortality from Consumption [tuberculosis] in the Dusty Trades,\" published by the US Department of Labor, produced the first national efforts to reduce lung damage in the workplace. He also published the first work (1915) linking tobacco to lung cancer.\n\nFrom this, he became vice president of the National Tuberculosis Association (today known as the American Lung Association) and later demonstrated the connection between exposure to asbestos and the disease that killed my father, mesothelioma (a bit of data that asbestos companies worked to keep hidden for the next 80 years).\n\nIn 1913, Hoffman wrote a seminal paper on the relationship between workplace pollution and cancer, which led him to cofound the American Society for the Control of Cancer (known today as the American Cancer Society). In 1937, he extended his research beyond the workplace and published Cancer and Diet: With Facts and Observations on Related Subjects, a book correctly pointing out the correlation between poor nutrition and cancer that is still in print at a dense 767 pages, mostly of statistical analysis between dietary habits and rates of disease.\n\nHis cancer research was so extensive and detailed (he concluded that diets heavy in processed foods and animal products produced higher cancer rates) that Adelle Davis-whose books were my mother's nutrition guru in the 1950s and '60s-became an early \"convert\" and \"a devotee of Frederick Hoffman.\" [iv]\n\nBut Hoffman's most controversial lifelong obsession was with the relationship between disease, race, and society.\n\nOn one of his first trips to Georgia, he wrote, he came across a book by Dr. Eugene R. Corson, a Georgia obstetrician, titled The Vital Equation of the Colored Race and Its Future in the United States. [v] It was apparently an updated or shortened version of Corson's widely read \"The Future of the Colored Race in the United States From an Ethnic and Medical Standpoint,\" published in 1887 in the New York Medical Times. [vi]\n\nThis was just after the failure of Reconstruction, and a widespread topic of speculation, particularly in the South, was whether Black people would soon outnumber white people in that part of the country. The Ku Klux Klan and others calling for wholesale slaughter and suppression of Black people claimed that they were more likely to have larger families because they were \"more prolific,\" code for \"excessively sexual,\" a charge that had persisted from the earliest days of slavery and led to the murder of Emmett Till (among others).\n\nHowever, the \"scientific\" racists of the day, like Corson, thought differently. Corson led a movement suggesting that people of African ancestry, now lacking the protective womb of slavery, would die out for the simple reason that the Black race was inferior to whites.\n\nCorson acknowledged the Klan's argument that \"the simpler the organism, the simpler the genesis and the greater the prolificness.\" But, he said, white people would prevail because they were less likely to die of disease, citing Herbert Spencer's \"Theory of Population Deduced from the General Law of Animal Fertility.\" [vii]\n\nWhile Black people might have more children, Corson wrote, white people would still outnumber them because Black fecundity \"is more than compensated for by the ability [of white people] to maintain individual life.\"\n\nEnslaved people from Africa had found themselves in a civilization \"of which [they are] not a product\" and thus were less likely to be successful in \"the struggle for existence.\" Therefore, Corson wrote, Black people \"must suffer physically, a result which forbids any undue increase in the race.\"\n\nThe discovery of this theory, called the racial extinction thesis, electrified Hoffman, and he spent the rest of his life promoting it, while campaigning to stop any sort of movement toward a national health insurance program that might prevent or slow down the extinction of Black people in America.\n\nIn August 1896, the American Economic Association published a book that represented a turning point in Frederick Hoffman's life and sealed the fate of single-payer health insurance in America. It was Hoffman's magnum opus, summarizing decades of compiled statistics on Black versus white mortality, proving, according to Hoffman, once and for all, that for Black people, \"gradual extinction is only a question of time.\" [viii]\n\nIn Race Traits and Tendencies of the American Negro, Hoffman set out not only to repeatedly make and statistically prove the above claim, but also to prove that anytime white people tried to help Black people, particularly by offering them healthcare services, the result was disaster for both.\n\nNoting that \"the Negro has failed to gain a foothold in any of the northern states,\" Hoffman wrote, \"he is in the South as a permanent factor . . . with a tendency to drift into the cities, there to concentrate in the most undesirable and unsanitary sections . . . and the evil effect will be more felt by the cities which are thus augmented in population of an undesirable character.\" [ix]\n\nIn great detail, Hoffman spent about 300 pages documenting, with exhaustive tables and statistics, the fact that Black people were more likely to die as a result of everything from malaria to tuberculosis to childbirth.\n\nAnd it was all because of their race, Hoffman noted:\n\n\"The decrease in the rate of increase of the colored population has been traced first to the excessive mortality, which in turn has been traced to an inferior vital capacity. . . . This racial inferiority has, in turn, brought about a moral deterioration . . . sexual immorality . . . diminished social and economic efficiency . . .\"\n\nAnd that represented a danger to white people, Hoffman wrote.\n\nThe participation of freed Black people in the contemporary labor pool and in society overall, he wrote, \"in the course of years must prove not only a most destructive factor in the progress of the colored race, but also in the progress, social as well as economic, of the white race brought under its influence.\"\n\nSlavery had actually been good for Black people, Hoffman believed, and the abolition of slavery at the end of the Civil War was only going to speed up the demise of that race.\n\n\"Nothing is more clearly shown from this investigation,\" he wrote, \"than that the southern black man at the time of emancipation was healthy in body and cheerful in mind. He neither suffered inordinately from disease nor from impaired bodily vigor.\"\n\nBut with abolition, formerly enslaved people were \"tending toward a condition in which matters will be worse than they are now, when diseases will be more destructive, vital resistance still lower, when the number of births will fall below the deaths, and gradual extinction of the race will take place.\"\n\nWhile Hoffman pioneered linking causal conditions such as asbestos and carcinogen exposure to sickness, he was so blinded by racism that a modern reader of his book constantly finds himself shouting, \"But these things are also true of poor whites! These are caused by discrimination and poverty!!\"\n\nAt the time, though, the vast majority of white Americans agreed with him. He was echoing the white cultural and scientific consensus of the late 19th and early 20th centuries when he wrote:\n\n\"Given the same conditions of life for two races, the one of Aryan descent will prove the superior, solely on account of its ancient inheritance of virtue and transmitted qualities which are determining factors in the struggle for race supremacy. The lower races, even under the same conditions of life, must necessarily fail because the vast number of incapables which a hard struggle for life has eliminated from the ranks of the white races, are still forming the large body of the lower races.\"\n\nAnd, according to Hoffman and the other white \"scientific racists,\" the problem wasn't just physical inferiority. The deepest \"problem of the Negro,\" Hoffman wrote, was moral:\n\n\"All the facts prove that a low standard of sexual morality is the main and underlying cause of the low and anti-social condition of the race at the present time. . . . The conclusion is warranted that it is merely a question of time when the actual downward course, that is, a decrease in the population will take place. In the meantime, however, the presence of the colored population is a serious hindrance to the economic progress of the white race.\"\n\nFor those well-intentioned white people who wanted to help out the people who were a mere generation or two away from slavery, Hoffman (and his colleagues, including the Prudential Life Insurance Company) had one simple bit of advice: Don't even try.\n\nIn 1980, David Koch famously ran for vice president of the United States under the banner of the Libertarian Party, an organization founded a few decades earlier by big business to give an economic rationale and political patina to their simple theory that economics were more important than democracy, and the quality of life of working people should be decided in the \"free marketplace\" instead of by unions or through democratic processes via government regulation.\n\nIn this, Koch and his Libertarian friends were echoing Frederick Hoffman.\n\nIn his 1896 book Race Traits, Hoffman laid out his \"scientific\" assertion that when government steps in to help people, it invariably ends up hurting them instead. Not only should there be no government assistance given to help African Americans recover from three centuries of property theft, forced labor, and legal violence, but it is scientifically wrong to even consider the idea.\n\nWhite people and government programs to better the lives of Black people, Hoffman wrote, deserve \"the most severe condemnation of modern attempts of superior races to lift inferior races to their own elevated position.\" The damage done to Black people by offering them any sort of help, government assistance, or even a minimum wage, he wrote, is \"criminal\" behavior for a \"civilized people.\"\n\nHoffman pointed to Native Americans to prove his point:\n\n\"Few races have made such a brave struggle for their own preservation; few races can boast of so high a degree of aboriginal civilization. . . . An iron will can be traced upon the countenance of nearly every Indian of note.\"\n\nBut it was government help, Hoffman wrote, that destroyed the American Indian.\n\nIt wasn't \"adulterated whiskey nor the frightful consequences of sexual immorality, spread around the forts and settlements of the whites,\" that was \"sufficient\" to destroy Native Americans. It was charity.\n\n\"The most subtle agency of all,\" he wrote, sounding like Ronald Reagan or David Koch, \"governmental pauperism, the highest development of the theory of easy conditions of life, did what neither drink nor the poisons of venereal disease could do, and today the large majority of the tribes are following the Maories and Hawaiians towards the goal of final extinction.\"\n\nWhite Americans rationalized their brutality toward Native Americans and African Americans by saying that it was simple evolutionary biology: only the strong survive, and when the weak are allowed to propagate, it weakens the overall human race.\n\n\"Easy conditions of life and a liberal charity are among the most destructive influences affecting the lower races,\" Hoffman concluded, \"since by such methods the weak and incapable are permitted to increase and multiply, while the struggle of the more able is increased in severity [by the increase in taxes and regulation].\"\n\nAnd it's not just charity.\n\n\"All the facts prove,\" Hoffman wrote, \"that education, philanthropy, and religion have failed to develop [among Black people] a higher appreciation of the stern and uncompromising virtues of the Aryan race. \"Instead of making the race more independent, modern educational and philanthropic efforts have succeeded in making it even more dependent on the white race at the present time than it was previous to emancipation.\"\n\nFree education-as any Libertarian can tell you-is more dangerous to the souls of people than slavery. And free healthcare is even worse.\n\nSounding like a modern-day acolyte of Ayn Rand, Hoffman wrote:\n\n\"Instead of clamoring for aid and assistance from the white race, the negro himself should sternly refuse every offer of direct interference in his own evolution. The more difficult his upward struggle, the more enduring will be the qualities developed.\"\n\nAnd, like Ayn Rand, David Koch, and Ronald Reagan, Hoffman believed that these were eternal truths independent of race\":\n\n\"No missionary or educator or philanthropist extended aid or comfort to the English peasant class during its darkest days, to the earliest settlers on the coast of New England, or the pioneer in the forests of the far West. . . . [I]t is extremely rare to find a case where easy conditions of life or liberal charity have assisted man in his upward struggle. Self reliance . . . must be developed, and thus far have not been developed by the aid of charity or liberal philanthropy.\"\n\nThis libertarian ideal is still pervasive in our modern fragmented healthcare system, and in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis in 2020, it resulted in thousands of daily American deaths, disproportionately hitting racial minorities.\n\nThe \"compulsory health insurance\" (what today we'd call Medicare for All) movement of the early 20th century was as much (and possibly more) about getting paid sick leave as it was about covering doctor visits and hospitalization, because healthcare was so cheap that an unpaid week at work was a bigger hit to the wallet.\n\nBut workers wanted both.\n\nThe most successful effort of the era came out of an organization that a small group of progressive economists put together in 1905 and 1906, known as the American Association for Labor Legislation (AALL).\n\nTheir initial efforts were directed at paid sick leave, workers' compensation insurance, child labor laws, and workplace safety standards. To that last end, they were actively using the kinds of statistical analysis that Frederick Hoffman had both used and popularized to do everything from laying out his theories on race to showing an association between tobacco use and lung cancer.\n\nHoffman joined the AALL to promote their efforts.\n\nA charitable reading of his motivations was that his statistical research on workplace phosphorus poisoning and lung disease overlapped with their efforts, and they were an organization that, at that time, was held in high regard. He did, after all, consider himself-and was, in a very real way-a major force for reform in public health and workplace safety arenas.\n\nA less charitable motivation is posited in Daniel T. Rodgers's 1998 book Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age. [x] Rodgers wrote:\n\n\"On the AALL social insurance committee, he became the [Prudential] company's mole. . . . Hoffman took credit for blocking the drafting of any resolutions at the AALL's social insurance conference in 1913. During the framing of the association's model health insurance bill, he dragged his feet, obstructed, pressed in vain for company initiatives in the medical insurance field, and informed his employers-more and more certain that public health insurance was 'distinctly pernicious and a menace to our interests.'\"\n\nDespite Prudential and Hoffman's efforts, government-funded health insurance was gaining popularity in America (and being considered or adopted in Europe).\n\nIn 1912, Theodore Roosevelt made a third-party bid for the presidency, forming the Progressive Party (with its Bull Moose logo), and called for \"the protection of home life against the hazards of sickness, irregular employment and old age through the adoption of a system of social insurance.\"\n\nJane Addams (Hull House founder), dressed in suffragette white, seconded Roosevelt's nomination to wild cheers and applause; Roosevelt rallies routinely drew tens of thousands of people, and more than 200,000 people showed up in Los Angeles to support him and the party. [xi]\n\nRoosevelt's endorsement of \"social insurance,\" including health coverage, both reflected and reinforced a growing national sentiment, and in 1915 the AALL called for every state to support a program of health insurance. Prudential hadn't yet gotten into the business of insuring health (they would in 1925), but they could see the writing on the wall.\n\nWhat finally blew up Hoffman's support of the AALL apparently had to do with a system of insurance that had started in the late 17th century in the United Kingdom to cover fire losses and had gradually grown to include other forms of protection.\n\nIt was called mutual insurance and was unique from Prudential's model in that the companies were owned by their policyholders instead of traditional corporate stockholders.\n\nIn this regard, mutual insurance companies ran much like employee-owned co-ops and lived in the nonprofit world both practically and philosophically. They also had lower operating costs, as they didn't have to shovel wheelbarrows of cash to their stockholders and senior executives.\n\nAmerica had a tradition of mutual insurance that started in 1752 with a company known as \"the Philadelphia Contributionship for the Insurance of Houses From Loss by Fire.\" Its founder was Benjamin Franklin and it still exists; the idea of mutual property and casualty insurance companies grew from there across the states and around the world. [xii]\n\nIn 1916, the AALL endorsed health insurance provided through a network of local and statewide mutual companies and called for those policies to also provide a small death benefit to cover funeral costs, which would have competed directly with the funeral coverage that was Prudential's main cash cow.\n\nHoffman wrote to the company, \"We, of course, cannot compete with Compulsory Insurance, including a death benefit of, say $100.\" [xiii] He then resigned \"in disgust\" from the AALL and begin a campaign, sponsored by Prudential, to stop nonprofit, state-funded health insurance.\n\nHoffman and Prudential weren't alone in their concern: the Insurance Federation of New York told their members:\n\n\"This is only the entering wedge; if once a foothold is obtained it will mean attempts to have such State Insurance of all kinds including fire.\" [xiv]\n\nThe AALL produced model legislation that was taken up in 1916 by eight states, including California and New York, the former via a ballot initiative and the latter in the New York legislature. In addition to calling for policies that would pay all costs of healthcare, the AALL's legislation called for up to 26 weeks of paid sick leave.\n\nPicking up steam, the American Medical Association endorsed the AALL's model legislation as well. The battle was joined.\n\nHoffman's Prudential-sponsored campaign to prevent any state from adopting a statewide nonprofit health (and death benefit) insurance program went into overdrive through 1916-1920. He traveled to Germany several times to chronicle, in minute detail, the failings of the kaiser's system that had been operating since 1885.\n\nPrudential, in 1905, had been swept up in New York's Armstrong Investigation, and so, as historian Beatrix Hoffman (no relation to Frederick) wrote, \"[b]ecause of their industry's public image problems, insurance executives knew their opposition to compulsory health insurance would be perceived as brazen self-interest.\" [xv]\n\nThey needed a front man, and the guy who was famous for discovering the causes of numerous public health crises was perfect. Thus, Frederick Hoffman became the most well-known face of a massive, multiyear effort to stop the AALL's campaign. He was remarkably effective.\n\nIn the years between 1916, when he resigned from AALL, and 1920, when nonprofit state-funded health insurance finally died, Hoffman wrote numerous pamphlets trashing the German single-payer government health system, \"exposing\" corruption in the British efforts at a National Health Service, and arguing that America's healthcare system would be thrown into chaos and crisis if the AALL's programs were adopted.\n\nHis work was widely distributed, as historian Daniel Rodgers noted: \"The Prudential saturated the state capitols with his pamphlets.\" [xvi]\n\nHis 1917 pamphlet Facts and Fallacies of Compulsory Health Insurance, and the subsequent More Facts and Fallacies of Compulsory Health Insurance, published two years later, were his most widely cited and most consequential writings.\n\nHistorian Beatrix Hoffman wrote that the Facts pamphlet \"resembled Race Traits and Tendencies in its impressive presentation of statistics and graphs alongside passionate polemics.\" Frederick Hoffman refuted every figure the Progressives used in defense of their plan, from \"Misleading Data on German Longevity\" to \"Misleading Estimate of Cost\" and \"Disregard of Actuarial Methods.\" [xvii]\n\nAppealing to the Daniel Boone mythos of rugged, independent individualism that didn't require assistance from government, Frederick Hoffman wrote in More Facts and Fallacies of Compulsory Health Insurance:\n\n\"The ever-present menace to democracy and liberty is the perversion of the legislative function [toward providing health insurance].\" [xviii]\n\nLawmakers and the public, Hoffman wrote as America was fighting Germany during World War I, were supporting state-funded health insurance, \"which is unnecessary, and as essentially a product 'made in Germany' as any legislative panacea brought forward for the alleged good of the people during a generation or more. The propaganda had its origin in the program laid down by the International Association for Labor Legislation, which held its first meeting in Baste, Switzerland.\" [xix]\n\nHoffman went on to say:\n\n\"The proposed legislation strikes one more blow at self-dependence and initiative and makes your citizen a subject, whether of king or of commission matters little. Self-dependence and initiative, virtues only permitted to a few favored individuals in older forms of government, are again to be taken away from a large number of citizens, in return for a mess of pottage, and the normal cycle of human stupidity becomes obvious. The Constitution promised liberty and happiness, not supervision and comfort; that is, the guarantees were moral, not material.\"\n\nCiting a 1917 report from the New Jersey Commission on Old Age, Insurance and Pensions, Hoffman wrote:\n\n\"Under any and every system of social insurance the development of autocratic and arbitrary methods of interference with personal rights and liberties is a foregone conclusion.\"\n\nQuoting the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Hoffman wrote:\n\n\"[T]he State should concentrate its efforts on preventive work rather than on the attempt to cure diseases through insurance; in that the Workmen's Compensation Act had already taken some of the liberties away from the individual wage-earner, and that health insurance would take more; that the tendency of health insurance would be to pauperize the workers; that health insurance was not suited to American needs; that health insurance abroad was economically unsuccessful; that its cost was prohibitive; that it was an encouragement of malingering, and that self-respecting labor did not desire it.\" [xx]\n\nToward the end of the pamphlet, once again warning of the dangers to America of adopting anything resembling Bismarck's single-payer national health insurance system, Hoffman summarized:\n\n\"The German experiment in paternalism and coercion sounds the most convincing note of warning to other industrial countries, where under free institutions, under conditions of voluntary service, savings and self-sacrifice, infinitely better and more lasting results have been achieved. \"It is devoutly to be hoped that the warning will be heeded by the American people and that they will develop a strong and thoroughly effective opposition to any and every tendency towards autocracy, paternalism and coercion, under the plea of Social Insurance as inherently hostile and fatal to our traditional conceptions of personal and political liberty in a democracy.\" [xxi]\n\nHoffman's writing and speeches shook America's political systems, particularly as this German-born \"man of science\" warned of the dire consequences to American liberty and democracy represented by universal health insurance.\n\nIn 1918, John R. Commons-one of the AALL's cofounders-wrote that almost all the nation's anti-compulsory health insurance propaganda \"originates from one source; all of the ammunition, all of the facts and statistics that may come across, no matter who gives them to you, will be found to go back to the Prudential Insurance Co. of America, and to Mr. Frederick L. Hoffman.\" [xxii]\n\nPrudential paid to transport Hoffman all across America, from media events to congressional hearings to a trip to England to document the horrors of their National Health Service system, which had gone into effect in 1911.\n\nHe wrote from London, in a widely read paper, that because of the British National Insurance Act, \"The fine spirit of the English working classes, at one time the finest people of that type in the world, is gone, entirely gone.\" [xxiii]\n\nHistorian Beatrix Hoffman wrote, \"His agitation was tireless, his influence widespread. . . . His reputation as an expert allowed Hoffman to participate in the deliberations of the health insurance commissions of Illinois, Wisconsin, and Connecticut, and to successfully persuade commission members to vote against the plan.\"\n\nIn 1920, in large part because of Prudential's efforts and Hoffman's warnings, California's voters resoundingly turned down a voter initiative in that state to provide health insurance, and, although New York's Senate passed the bill, it died in committee in the Assembly.\n\nWhile the AALL continued to campaign for state-funded health insurance until their dissolution in 1946, they never again gained enough traction to get their proposal before any state legislatures or the US Congress.\n\nHaving succeeded in killing state-funded health insurance, Hoffman, in the later 1920s, turned his attention back to his theory that Black people would eventually die out, joining the Eugenics Research Association (whose work was later used by Hitler to justify racial separation and his \"final solution\").\n\nIn 1929, Hoffman asserted, in the African American publication Opportunity, that \"the white race is almost solely responsible . . . for the health progress which the South has made during the last generation\" and that Black people moving in large numbers into cities would \"lead to a thoroughly unwholesome state of affairs which unquestionably will express itself in course of time in a lower birth rate and a higher death rate.\" [xxiv]\n\nHoffman's influence lasted long past his death in 1946 (which satisfied his stated desire to live long enough to see FDR out of office). As late as 1984, according to reporting in the Wall Street Journal, Prudential was still collecting premiums from African Americans that were \"in some instances more than a third higher\" than those paid by whites.

      "text": "Trump's Christian Nationalists are targeting those the Bible is most worried about\n\n\"There has almost always been an outright hostility that is shown towards people of the Christian faith,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said on a podcast recently. He was talking with Tony Perkins, a former Louisiana lawmaker and president of the Family Research Council, about freedom of religion and the actions of the second Trump administration.\n\nI have to admit that such a statement from this country's third most powerful politician and an avowed Christian nationalist almost takes my breath away. Of all the people facing hostility, discrimination, and violence now and throughout history, Christians like Mike Johnson rank low on the list. Still, his comment is consistent with a disturbing religious trend in the country right now.\n\nAs an early act of his second administration, President Donald Trump has created an anti-Christian bias task force to be chaired by Attorney General Pam Bondi. At the same time, he's slashing federal jobs and programs, threatening Medicaid, Head Start, the Department of Education, affordable housing programs, accommodations for the disabled, environmental protections, public health and safety, Social Security, and Medicare, while scapegoating immigrants and trans kids. It's particularly ironic that Trump, Johnson, and the people with them in the top echelons of power are targeting those that the Bible is most concerned about-children, the poor, immigrants, the sick and disabled, women, the vulnerable, and the Earth itself. Meanwhile, Elon Musk , the richest man ever to exist, who has built his wealth off exploiting the poor, goes so far as to call the impoverished \"parasites.\" After all, there are more than 2,000 biblical passages that speak about protecting the vulnerable, offering good news to the poor, stewarding God's creation, and bringing judgment down upon those with wealth and power who make people suffer.\n\nThe Christian nationalism, exceptionalism, and white supremacy ascendant in Trump 2.0 has evolved from a long genealogy that has enabled an elite strata of mostly white Christian men to rule society and amass enormous wealth and power throughout American history.\n\nPope Francis himself has weighed in on the regressive policies and posture of the current administration. To America's bishops he wrote , \"The true common good is promoted when society and government, with creativity and strict respect for the rights of all-as I have affirmed on numerous occasions-welcomes, protects, promotes, and integrates the most fragile, unprotected, and vulnerable.\" Indeed, if any Christians are under attack right now, it's those included in what liberation theologians have called \"God's preferential option for the poor \" (the very creation for whom God has special love and care) and those standing up with and for them.\n\nThe Pope hasn't been the only one to challenge the use of religion in the Trump administration. Since the inauguration, the actions of Johnson, Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and others have been opposed and decried by people of faith of many persuasions. Remember Episcopal Bishop Mariann Budde imploring President Trump to show mercy, especially to immigrants and LGBTQ+ people, at the Inaugural Prayer Service at the Washington National Cathedral? Since her gentle reminder that the Bible teaches love, truth, and mercy, she has received regular and credible death threats on a daily basis, even as people have also flocked to the cathedral and other houses of worship in search of moral leaders willing to stand up to the bullying tactics of Donald Trump, the richest man on earth Elon Musk , and their cronies.\n\nIn response to Trump's threats of mass detention and deportation, especially removing \" sensitive sites \" status from houses of worship, schools, and hospitals, while threatening \" sanctuary cities \" with a loss of federal funding, 27 religious groups have sued the Trump administration for infringement of their religious liberty to honor and worship God by loving their immigrant neighbors. Kelsi Corkran, a lawyer with the Georgetown University Law Center's Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection and lead counsel in that lawsuit, said that plaintiffs joined the suit \"because their scripture, teaching, and traditions offer irrefutable unanimity on their religious obligation to embrace and serve the refugees, asylum-seekers, and immigrants in their midst without regard to documentation or legal status.\"\n\nFaith leaders are coming together to support and protect transgender and nonbinary people now under attack by the Trump administration as well. My colleagues Aaron Scott and Moses Hernandez-McGavin recently penned an article for Religion News Service where they affirmed the dignity of LGBTQ+ people, even as Christian nationalists continue to build their influence and power by damning LGBTQ+ communities, all while claiming to protect children and traditional family values. \"Gender diversity,\" they wrote,\n\nThe battle of theologies taking place right now is anything but a new phenomenon, even if it's at an inflection point , with life-and-death consequences for our democracy, Christianity itself, and those who are God's greatest concern. The Christian nationalism, exceptionalism, and white supremacy ascendant in Trump 2.0 has evolved from a long genealogy that has enabled an elite strata of mostly white Christian men to rule society and amass enormous wealth and power throughout American history.\n\nSuch Christians have always anointed themselves with the lie of divine righteousness, while insisting that they are God's chosen representatives on Earth. To maintain this charade, they have brandished the Bible like a cudgel, bludgeoning poor people, people of color, the Indigenous, women, LGBTQ+ people, and others with tales of their supposed sinfulness meant to distract, demean, divide, and dispossess. Therefore, if we are truly serious about confronting and countering the influence of such an authoritarian version of Christianity under Trump, Vance, Johnson, and their associates and followers, we must learn from how it's been wielded (and challenged) in other times in history.\n\nThe roots of such idolatry reach back centuries, even before the founding of this nation, to the conquest of Indigenous lands by European invaders. In 1493, after Spain first sent its ships to islands in the Caribbean, Pope Alexander VI issued the Doctrine of Discovery , a series of papal bulls granting all newly \"discovered\" lands to their Christian conquerors. Those church documents asserted the supposed \"godlessness\" of Indigenous peoples, smoothing over the ruthless colonial campaign of extermination being waged with a veneer of moral virtue. Centuries later, the idea of \" manifest destiny \" drew on the same religious underpinnings as the Doctrine of Discovery, popularizing the belief that white Christians were destined by God to control and therefore redeem the lands of the West. Manifest destiny not only valorized the violence of westward expansion but sanctified and made exceptional the emerging project of American imperialism. God, the argument went, had chosen this nation to be a beacon of hope, a city upon a hill for the whole world.\n\nToday, while the Trump administration continues to unveil new attacks daily on what the Bible calls, \"the least of these,\" it's important to remember the prophetic tradition of faith leaders of the past as well as the heroic, if often unnoticed, moral organizing happening now.\n\nAlongside the dispossession and attempted extermination of Indigenous peoples, invocations of God and the Bible were used to justify the enslavement of African peoples and their descendants. Slaveholders cherry-picked passages from the book of Ephesians-\" slaves obey your earthly masters \"-and lines from other epistles of the Apostle Paul to claim that slavery was ordained by God. They ripped out of the pages on the Exodus from Egypt, huge sections of the prophets, and even Jesus' inaugural sermon praising the poor and dispossessed from the Bibles they gave to their enslaved workers. Those \" Slave Bibles \" would serve as evidence of just how dangerous the unadulterated gospel was to the legitimacy of the slaveholding planter class.\n\nThey also twisted theology to serve their political needs by obscuring the common interests of enslaved Black workers and poor Southern whites. Readings of the Bible that claimed God had singled out Black people for slave labor helped the Southern ruling class turn many of the region's majority of poor whites into zealous defenders of a system that relegated them to marginal lands and poverty wages.\n\nAfter the fall of the Confederacy, the Bible remained core to the new racialized divide-and-conquer system in the South. Pro-segregationist preachers, no longer able to use the Bible to defend slavery per se, turned to stories like the Tower of Babel to claim that God desired racial segregation and abhorred intermarriage across racial lines. In 1954, Baptist preacher Carey Daniel wrote a pamphlet entitled God the Original Segregationist in which he explained: \"When first He separated the Black race from the white and lighter skinned races He did not simply put them in different parts of town. He did not even put them in different towns or states. Nay, He did not even put them in adjoining countries.\" The pamphlet was distributed widely by White Citizens' Councils and sold more than a million copies.\n\nParallel to the theological justifications for the system of segregation that came to be known as Jim Crow, a national theology of industrial capitalism emerged in the late 1800s and early 1900s. During the Gilded Age, a prosperity gospel and its theology of muscular Christianity flourished among the white upper class. Amid the excesses of the Second Industrial Revolution, they celebrated their own hard work and moral rectitude and bemoaned the personal failings of the poor. When the economic bubble finally burst in 1929 with the Great Depression and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal ushered in an unprecedented era of financial regulation and labor protection, the nation's corporate class turned once again to the church to fight back and put a stamp of approval on its free-market aspirations.\n\nAs historian Kevin Kruse writes in One Nation Under God: How Corporate America Invented Christian America , in the 1930s and 1940s, \"corporate titans enlisted conservative clergymen in an effort to promote new political arguments embodied in the phrase 'freedom under God.' As the private correspondence and public claims of the men leading this charge make clear, this new ideology was designed to defeat the state power its architects feared most-not the Soviet regime in Moscow, but Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal administration in Washington. With ample funding from major corporations, prominent industrialists, and business lobbies such as the National Association of Manufacturers and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in the 1930s and 1940s, these new evangelists for free enterprise promoted a vision best characterized as 'Christian libertarianism.'\"\n\nThe phrase \"freedom under God\" captures the tension at the heart of the long battle over the Bible in this country in which there have always been two diametrically opposed visions of freedom: on one side, the freedom of the vast majority of the people to enjoy the fruits of their labor and live with dignity and self-determination; on the other side, the freedom of the wealthy to control society, sow division, and hoard the planet's (and in Elon Musk's case, the galaxy's) abundance for themselves. Poor people, disproportionately poor people of color, have always been on the front lines of this battle, as both canaries in the coal mine and prophetic leaders. Think of it this way in the age of Trump: As their lives go, so goes the nation.\n\nThis age-old debate is playing out in JD Vance's recent statement about \" ordo amoris \" (or \" rightly-ordered love \"). Weighing in on cutting both domestic and global aid as well as scapegoating immigrants, the vice president wrote on social media, \"You love your family, and then you love your neighbor, and then you love your community, and then you love your fellow citizens in your own country. And then after that, you can focus and prioritize the rest of the world.\"\n\nPope Francis offered a fitting rebuttal to Vance's statement and the actions of the second Trump administration by summing up its deeply heretical nature and echoing a historic prophetic tradition of increasing importance again today. In his letter to the American bishops, urging them to reject Vance's theology of isolationism and egotism, Pope Francis wrote , \"Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups. In other words: the human person is not a mere individual, relatively expansive, with some philanthropic feelings! The human person is a subject with dignity who, through the constitutive relationship with all, especially with the poorest, can gradually mature in his identity and vocation. The true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the 'Good Samaritan' (cf. Lk 10:25-37), that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.\"\n\nAs this statement from the Pope reminds us, history is replete with examples of people from many religions who have grounded their struggles for justice in the holy word and the spirit of God, not just extremists trying to claim and justify their lust for power and avarice for wealth. Abolitionists, suffragists, labor organizers, student protestors, civil rights leaders, and various representatives of poor and oppressed people have insisted that divinity cannot be reduced to private matters of the soul and salvation. They have affirmed that truth, love, and justice, starting with the most vulnerable and marginalized, are what matter the most to God. They have insisted that the worship of God must be concerned with the building of a society in which all life is cared for and treated with dignity. In every previous era, there were courageous people for whom protest and public action were a form of prayer, even as the religious leaders and institutions of their day hid behind sanctuary walls-walls currently being torn down again to release forces devastating to the most vulnerable among us and to the planet itself.\n\nToday, while the Trump administration continues to unveil new attacks daily on what the Bible calls, \"the least of these,\" it's important to remember the prophetic tradition of faith leaders of the past as well as the heroic, if often unnoticed, moral organizing happening now. I return to my colleagues Aaron Scott and Moses Hernandez-McGavin who sum up the sentiment of many people of faith in our society today: \"God's love and truth are alive whether elected officials seek to legislate them out of existence or not. God's Word continues to call for justice and mercy for all people regardless of the distortions of the Word by religious and political leaders obsessed with the worship of their own power. They are not God. And God will not, and cannot, be stopped.\"\n\nAs they conclude, offering a message of hope and encouragement in these dark and dangerous days: \"God's liberating action will break through in this world through the steadfast work and witness of people of goodwill who are beholden to a higher law, who refuse to comply with unjust executive orders, who continue to defend the vulnerable against abuses of the powerful in courtrooms and school buildings and hospitals and in the streets across the country.\"\n\nThe question then is: In the second age of Donald Trump, which side will you choose?"

      "text": "Fox News is Tearing Us Apart: Race Baiting and Divisiveness Hits a Disgusting New Low\n\nThe continuing right-wing effort to make a hero out of Michael Brown's killer, Darren Wilson, may not turn out so well, if the past is any guide. Remember Cliven Bundy? Donald Sterling? George Zimmerman?\n\nJust because liberals don't like someone doesn't mean he should automatically be a hero to conservatives.  There was a point when even the National Review seemed to recognize this - editor Rich Lowry once wrote a column titled \" Al Sharpton Is Right ,\" about the need for charges to be filed against George Zimmerman, when Florida officials were dragging their heels.\n\nBut that time is long gone, apparently. And as a result, the right seems well on its way to aligning with the reemergence of a 21st century form of lynching, even while furiously insisting that they are totally post-racial. Cliven Bundy and Donald Sterling - the more readily and thoroughly renounced - didn't kill anyone, of course. But Zimmerman and Wilson both did, and both, to varying degrees, acted under color of law, which is precisely how plain old-fashioned lynching used to work, in a shadow realm that would not have allowed the killing of whites (except, of course, for \"race traitors\" who allied with blacks).\n\nIt didn't take long for people to start rallying to Darren Wilson's defense.  In less than a week, several hundred thousand dollars had been raised on his behalf - with a healthy smattering of hateful racist messages in support , such as \"I would have donated double this amount, but you missed his accomplice\" - and Fox News had run a flood of false, unsourced stories, claiming that Wilson's eye socket had been broken , implicitly \"proving\" that he had been in a heroic struggle for his life.\n\nIt was the overnight creation of what Joan Walsh called \"a thriving franchise of the nation's booming white grievance industry.\" In contrast, things moved more slowly when it came to making George Zimmerman a hero. Fox News and most of the rest of the right virtually ignored Trayvon Martin's killing for months, and even when they suddenly snapped to, it took a while for them to adopt Zimmerman as one of their own. Now, in contrast, it's all happening at warp speed.\n\nTwo decades ago, the acquittal of the officers who beat up Rodney King touched off the most widespread urban riot in a generation, but there was nothing similar in that coverage to the way that first Zimmerman, and now, apparently, Wilson are being treated as heroic figures. Given the role right-wing media plays in hero creation, it was only natural to turn to Media Matters for some perspective, and senior fellow Eric Boehlert made several points to Salon, to describe how we got here.\n\nFirst, Boehlert reminded us, today's conservative media were unlike anything in existence in 1992; second, that it was Obama's relatively benign comments that led conservatives to politicize the killing of Trayvon Martin; and third, that conservative media's 16-month involvement in smearing Trayvon Martin and defending George Zimmerman had created a new narrative niche, which was now readily filled with similar attacks on Michael Brown and defense of Darren Wilson. (Though Boehlert was describing the broad sweep of developments, one Media Matters blog post highlighted Geraldo Rivera's virtually identical pattern of victim-blaming in both cases.)\n\nFinally, more broadly, Boehlert noted  that white victimization - and thus rallying around victim/heroes - is the cornerstone of Fox News' programming, even as it's embraced the ideology that racism has been eradicated ( never mind the actual facts ), and concluded that the real racists are those who still talk about race.\n\n\"We have a right-wing media that's very different from the Clinton era right-wing media, in which, everything has to be partisan,\" Boehlert told Salon. If today's media had been around back then, he said, \"The L.A. riots would've been depicted as partisan. It would've been a left-right thing. The cops would've been the good guys no matter what; people - obviously the looters and rioters are separate - but anyone who raised questions about the beating would've been agitators, probably would've been ACORN or were communists or things like that.\"\n\nFast forwarding to the Obama era, Boehlert continued, \"You've got a right-wing media that I think kind of tipped its hand with the Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin case. For the first few weeks there was very little coverage, very little passion on Fox News or the right-wing blogs about that story.\"  Similar points were made at the time by Judd Legum at Think Progress , Simon Owens at the Moderate Voice , and Boehlert himself at Media Matters .\n\n\"Rich Lowry actually wrote a piece saying Al Sharpton was right, someone should be indicted for that murder,\" Boehlert continued - a point we'll return to in a moment. \"Then Obama addressed it, and once Obama enters the conversation about race, you know, they went from zero to a hundred ... they decided that the story was partisan, and that supporting Trayvon Martin was the Democratic position, supporting the guy who killed an unarmed teen was the Republican conservative position, and so they set up the markers, and went for  it. And the way they did that was they smeared a dead teenager for 16 months until Zimmerman's acquittal.\"\n\nTo understand the process of shaping the polarized narrative, it's helpful to go back to the moment before, to Lowry's Sharpton column. It was an odd mix of name-calling and common sense. Al Sharpton was a \"longtime provocateur\" and a \"perpetually aggrieved, shamelessly exploitative publicity hound,\" but like a stopped clock, \"he occasionally will be right,\" and this is one of those occasions, Lowry argued. Zimmerman, he said, should be arrested and tried:\n\nWe may never know what exactly happened in the altercation. We do know this: Through stupendous errors in judgment, Zimmerman brought about an utterly unnecessary confrontation and then - in the most favorable interpretation of the facts for him - shot Martin when he began to lose a fistfight to him.\n\nLowry took note of Florida's \"stand your ground\" law, but blithely downplayed the complexities of how it actually works in practice (\"It is one of the reasons that the police didn't press charges against Zimmerman,\" he admitted) and invoked its pure-as-the-driven-snow transcendent spirit:\n\nBut the law is not meant to be a warrant for aggressive vigilantism. It was Martin, chased by a stranger who wasn't an officer of the law, who had more reason to feel threatened and \"stand his ground\" than Zimmerman.\n\nThe jumbled mix of attitudes displayed in this piece might even be stable in some political environments - but not ours.  As Alex Pareene noted shortly afterward (\" Why Rush Limbaugh and the Right Turned On Trayvon Martin \"), the same day Lowry's column appeared everything changed:\n\nOn March 23, two things happened: Buffoon Geraldo Rivera made his infamous remarks on the role Martin's style of dress played in his death - a dumb point dumbly made - and President Obama told the press: \"My main message is to the parents of Trayvon Martin. You know, if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.\"\n\nIt was basically on this day that everything went to hell. The story of an unarmed teenager shot dead while walking home and a police force that decided that didn't constitute a crime suddenly became a partisan issue with numerous points of contention.\n\nJust to be clear, what Obama said was \"totally innocuous,\" as libertarian-leaning commentator Josh Barro noted at the time (\" Trayvon Martin and the Right's Race Problem \"). Obama was responding to a press conference question, and Barro saw the right's reaction as troubling. He cited the examples of Newt Gingrich and Rush Limbaugh, then said:\n\nThe claim running through these objections is that black Americans cannot have any special concerns in need of airing. Many of the issues raised in the Trayvon Martin case-was Trayvon Martin singled out for suspicion because he was black? Did race influence the Sanford police's handling of the case? What is the burden of profiling on young black men?-are therefore off limits.\n\nBarro went on to say that \"Conservatives, almost universally, feel like they get a bad rap on race,\" that they \"catch heat\" when they make a wide range of arguments that Barro clearly feels have some merit. But then he said:\n\nWhy do conservatives catch such heat? It's probably because there is still so much racism on the Right to go alongside valid arguments on issues relating to race and ethnicity. Conservatives so often get unfairly pounded on race because, so often, conservatives get fairly pounded on race.\n\nAnd to clarify what he had in mind, Barro went on to the topic of birtherism, about which he concluded:\n\nRepublican rejections of Birtherism tend to focus on the issue being \"a distraction,\" as RNC Chairman Reince Preibus puts it, rather than pointedly noting that it is a nutty, racist conspiracy theory.\n\nThere has been a clear strategic calculation here among Republican elites. Better to leverage or at least accept the racism of much of the Republican base than try to clean it up.\n\nBarro still seems to identify as a Republican, so that's going pretty far. But almost 50 years after Nixon first launched his \"Southern Strategy,\" it's a bit late to start worrying. More to the point, given the extent of GOP birtherism , sometimes it feels like if Republican elites cleaned up the racism in their base, they wouldn't have a base at all.\n\nTheir only recourse is to insist that it's not really racism, because folks like Al Sharpton and Barack Obama are the \"real racists\" - you know, folks who notice race and say something about it.\n\nThis was a point made by Kevin Drum the next day (\" The Conservative Agenda in the Trayvon Martin Case \"). Drum first noted that \"A week ago, the worst I could say about right-wing reaction to the Martin case was that conservatives were studiously ignoring it,\" but that things had suddenly changed. It wasn't surprising that conservatives had been silent, he noted, as there was no obvious conservative principle at stake in the shooting of Trayvon Martin:\n\nThere's no special conservative principle at stake that says neighborhood watch captains should be able to shoot anyone who looks suspicious. There's no special conservative principle at stake that says local police forces should barely even pretend to investigate the circumstances of a shooting. There's no special conservative principle at stake that says young black men shouldn't wear hoodies.\n\nAnd yet, he noted \"as Dave Weigel points out today, the conservative media is now defending the shooter, George Zimmerman, with an almost messianic zeal,\" most notably working itself up into a frenzy over a faked - even debunked - photograph of Trayvon as gangsta. So, clearly there must be some principle at stake, but what is it?  Drum then quotes from an L.A. Times Op-Ed by Jonah Goldberg, explaining that we shouldn't care about Martin's death because it was \"a statistical outlier\" - more blacks are killed by blacks than by any other race.  And this brings Drum an  epiphany:\n\nQuite so. And that, it turns out, is the conservative principle that's actually at stake here: convincing us all that traditional racism no longer really exists (just in \"pockets,\" says Goldberg) and that it's whites who are the real racial victims in today's America.\n\nAlex Pareene's piece, mentioned above, had a more elaborate analysis, citing four reasons that Martin's killing had become a left-right issue: 1) Movement conservatism's denial of racism (corollary: \"accusations of racism are the new racism, and said accusations are invariably politically motivated\"). 2) President Obama is extremely polarizing. 3) The killing was already political, given the role of Florida's \"stand your ground\" law. (\"Part of the frantic defense of Zimmerman is an attempt to ensure that liberals never, ever go back to the gun control advocacy they essentially gave up on after the 1990s.\") 4) Racism. The plain ole gut-level kind  (\"the sincere belief that if a black kid got shot, he probably had it coming\").\n\nOf course, you don't have to dig too deeply into (2) and (3) to find racism there as well. But the story here only begins with recognizing the presence of racism; it's much more about how racism changes, adapts, morphs, interacts with other issues and concerns, and, in the end, continues the age-old tradition of justifying the extra-legal execution of arbitrary victims \"who just happen to be black.\"\n\nAn example from now-distant history may be helpful here. During slavery, it was commonly propounded that the whites were both smarter and stronger than blacks. There were even faux concerns that if slavery were abolished, the black race would die out, unable to survive on its own. Once slavery ended, however, things changed. The \"happy docile slave stereotype\" (there were always multiple variants) was replaced by the predator/rapist, whose purported presence served to justify wave upon wave of lynching epidemics.\n\nWhat these examples show is how fluid racist ideologies can be under pressure, and yet still fulfill their same basic function of justifying and naturalizing racially stratified outcomes. The book \" Social Dominance: An Intergroup Theory of Social Hierarchy and Oppression \" explains how stratified societies maintain themselves with a mixture of hierarchy-enhancing and hierarchy-attenuating ideas, values and \"legitimating myths,\" which can vary over time, but still continued to produce stratified outcomes provided newer legitimating myths emerge to support hierarchy, as the older ones fall out of favor.\n\nIn America as a whole, perhaps the most useful framework for understanding this process in the so-called post-civil rights era is Eduardo Bonilla-Silva's concept of \"colorblind racism,\" as explained in his 2003 book, \" Racism Without Racists: Color-Blind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in the United States .\" While the idea of a \"colorblind\" social order was, in the 19th century, a relatively radical, emancipatory idea, more recently the notion has been turned upside down, with the claim that we are already colorblind, except, perhaps, for those who still see racial injustices. The concept of \"colorblind racism\" neatly captures what's involved in this shell game.\n\n\"The central component of any dominant racial ideology is its frames or set paths for interpreting information,\" Bonilla-Silva explained, and he identified four such frames at the heart of colorblind racism: 1) Abstract Liberalism , using ideas associated with political liberalism (such as \"equal opportunity,\" the idea that force should not be used to achieve social policy) and economic liberalism (choice, individualism) - in an abstract manner to explain racial matters. 2) Naturalization (\"That's just how things are.\") 3) Cultural Racism (arguments like \"Mexicans don't put much emphasis on education\" or \"Blacks have too many babies\" to explain the condition of minorities.) 4) Minimization of Racism, which simultaneously acknowledges and dismisses persistent racism (\"It's better now than in the past\" or \"There is discrimination, but there are plenty of jobs out there).\n\nWith this framework as background, it's not hard to understand the evolution of even more pernicious extremist variants in the right-wing media, which Boehlert sketched out. It began with Andrew Breitbart and his website announcing that \"basically racism had been eradicated, and that anyone who talked about the topic was therefore a racist,\" especially \"civil rights activists and civil libertarians ... because by raising questions, or talking about it, or discussing it, they were trying to rip the country apart, because the country is already solved racism.\"\n\nThus, the allegation is that simply talking about race in America makes you a racist. It is, as Boehlert called it, \"a very odd brand of projection\" that's \"very weird and complicated,\" but that's where the roles of endless repetition and cognitive closure come in. They naturalize and normalize what would otherwise clearly be both arbitrary and bizarre. After years in development, the result can be quite stunning, as Boehlert went on to note:\n\nThat's like Glenn [Beck] that went on Fox News and called the president of the United States a racist, because he dared to discuss it in the wake of the Henry Louis Gates arrest in Cambridge. So that's why he was denounced as having 'a hatred of white people. Why? Because he talked about race.\"\n\nOf course, the framework of colorblind racism also explains the persistence of racial stereotyping, albeit in a \"cultural\" framework.  But the right-wing media takes this aspect to extremes as well, which accounts for another, contradictory tendency: the persistence of \"increasingly race-baiting rhetoric,\" including all manner of things that Hannity, Limbaugh and Beck have been saying about Obama since his inauguration. \"This is some of the most rancid, insulting kind of gutter rhetoric you could imagine,\" Boehlert said.\" But the cone that they've tried to protect themselves in is that the other people are the racists. It's very weird. I guess said, it's a lot of weird projecting going on.\"\n\nWhile the development of colorblind racism as Bonila-Silva describes it took place over decades, the nastier variants in the right-wing media developed much more rapidly, spurred on in part by Obama's election. They have now burst forth in multiple forms, one of which is the automatic demonization of any black victim, and the matching valorization of whoever killed or injured that victim. Of course, the specific details of any given case are not always so accommodating to the pre-determined colorblind racist script. As a result, in the killings of both Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown, we've strikingly similar false claims about both victims, as well as the men who killed them, and some of those claims have persisted quite powerfully, despite all evidence to the contrary.\n\nWhile we've seen some of those attitudes most brazenly expressed on the Darren Wilson Gofundme site, we see more subtle echoes reflected in statements of support that are carefully crafted to conform to \"all-American\" norms, such as calls for due process - which Michael Brown, naturally, did not get, and which would not be threatened by treating Wilson like any other murder suspect.\n\nThis reflects a broader phenomenon, the persistent power of misinformation, which an inter-disciplinary collection of researchers has been studying for some years now. Most recently, I wrote about one study of misinformation in the context of three initiatives on Washington state's 2006 ballot. The issues involved were much less charged than the murder of an unarmed black teenager, but all the better, it occurred to me. It may be easier to anecdotally recognize extremely charged distortions in a rapidly shifting framework of rationalizations (unless you're a Fox News devotee), but as a matter of scientific methodology, it's easier to study less-charged distortions in more stable issue areas.\n\nSo, did someone with hands-on experience studying those less-charged distortions see similar issues at play, as I did? I decided to ask Justin Reedy, principle co-author of the Washington state study. \"Just anecdotally, I've seen some things that support both of the phenomena that we think might be happening with misperception: shoddy information in the media, and spontaneous creation of 'facts' or ideas that are in keeping with one's values,\" Reedy told me.\n\nIt's one of several important open questions in the field just how much distortion wells up from below and how much trickles down from above, and there's no reason why the proportions should be either similar or stable across different domains, especially in times of dramatic flux, which are particularly challenging to study.  But one can't help noticing how top-down and bottom-up influences can get jumbled together, as when Fox's Geraldo Rivera speculates on how white jurors will respond at trial:\n\nRIVERA: The white jurors will look at that convenience store surveillance tape. They will see Michael Brown menacing that clerk. The white jurors will put themselves in the shoes of that clerk. They'll say, of course the officer responded the way he did. He was menaced by a 6-foot 4-inch, 300-pound kid, 10 minutes fresh from a strong-armed robbery. The officer was defending himself. The white jurors will put themselves in the white officer's place. The black jurors will see Michael Brown, despite his flaws, as the surrogate for every black youngster ever shot. [Fox News, \"Outnumbered\"]\n\nRivera is purporting to present a \"balanced\" picture: what white jurors will see vs. what black jurors will. And it's quite true that jurors tend to have racially informed perspectives. But what's not true is that the surveillance tape had anything to do with the shooting, or that it should play any role in the trial. Hence, virtually all of Rivera's speculation about how white jurors would think is fatally tainted.  On the other hand, the black jurors are presented as intentionally ignoring evidence; \"despite his flaws\" apparently refers to the surveillance tape, which is legally irrelevant and has no place in a murder trial.  Such is the false balance that Rivera presents. It does not take any sort of leap to view Rivera's performance as providing instruction and guidance, as well as encouragement, for how white jurors should act, in order to legalize modern-day lynchings.\n\nAfter Zimmerman's acquittal, Boehlert wrote, in a retrospective overview :\n\nPledging to uncover the \"truth\" about the shooting victim and determined to prove definitively that anti-black racism doesn't exists in America (it's a political tool used by liberals, Republican press allies insist), many in the right-wing media have dropped any pretense of mourning Martin's death and set out to show how he probably deserved it.\n\nHe was certainly correct to focus attention on dichotomization (what psychologists call \"splitting\"), which links Martin's alleged victim-worthiness with Zimmerman's innocence, if not heroism. Naturally, the very act of \"proving\" that Martin had it coming was itself a classic form of racist behavior. The belief that such \"proof\" would \"prove\" that racism doesn't exist is itself only the latest twist in a very old story of how racism rationalizes itself.\n\nThe question now is how much both sides of this dichotomized narrative will be allowed to advance unchallenged, and more important, whether we will be able to bring new narratives into the discussion.  Allowing that old dichotomized narrative to advance means opening the way for a new era of lynching, at the hands of \"heroes\" like George Zimmerman, Darren Wilson and countless others like them - despite the incredible proliferation of social media and monitoring devices that should, in theory, help empower us with unprecedented knowledge, transparency and capacity for collective action.\n\nBut the tools we have at hand are only as good as the hearts and minds that use them.  And our hearts and minds are only as good as our commitment to learn hard truths from our history, rather than blindly repeat it."

His family said in a statement that Van Peebles died Tuesday night, Sept. 21, 2021, at his home. (AP Photo/Evan Agostini, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Melvin Van Peebles, the groundbreaking filmmaker, playwright and musician whose work ushered in the \"blaxploitation\" wave of the 1970s and influenced filmmakers long after, has died. He was 89.\n\nIn statement, his family said that Van Peebles, father of the actor-director Mario Van Peebles, died Tuesday evening at his home in Manhattan.\n\n\"Dad knew that Black images matter. If a picture is worth a thousand words, what was a movie worth?\" Mario Van Peebles said in a statement Wednesday. \"We want to be the success we see, thus we need to see ourselves being free. True liberation did not mean imitating the colonizer's mentality. It meant appreciating the power, beauty and interconnectivity of all people.\"\n\nSometimes called the \"godfather of modern Black cinema,\" the multitalented Van Peebles wrote numerous books and plays, and recorded several albums - playing multiple instruments and delivering rap-style lyrics. He later became a successful options trader on the stock market.\n\nBut he was best known for \"Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song,\" one of the most influential movies of its time. The low-budget, art-house film, which he wrote, produced, directed, starred in and scored, was the frenzied, hyper-sexual and violent tale of a Black street hustler on the run from police after killing white officers who were beating a Black revolutionary.\n\nWith its hard-living, tough-talking depiction of life in the ghetto, underscored by a message of empowerment as told from a Black perspective, it set the tone for a genre that turned out dozens of films over the next few years and prompted a debate over whether Black people were being recognized or exploited.\n\n\"All the films about Black people up to now have been told through the eyes of the Anglo-Saxon majority in their rhythms and speech and pace,\" Van Peebles told Newsweek in 1971, the year of the film's release.\n\n\"I could have called it 'The Ballad of the Indomitable Sweetback.' But I wanted the core audience, the target audience, to know it's for them,\" he told The Associated Press in 2003. \"So I said 'Ba-ad Asssss,' like you really say it.\"\n\nMade for around $500,000 (including $50,000 provided by Bill Cosby), it grossed $14 million at the box office despite an X-rating, limited distribution and mixed critical reviews. The New York Times, for example, accused Van Peebles of merchandizing injustice and called the film \"an outrage.\"\n\nVan Peebles, who complained fiercely to the Motion Picture Association over the X-rating, gave the film the tagline: \"Rated X by an all-white jury.\"\n\nBut in the wake of the its success, Hollywood realized an untapped audience and began churning out such box office hits as \"Shaft\" and \"Superfly\" that were also known for bringing in such top musicians as Curtis Mayfield, Marvin Gaye and Isaac Hayes to work on the soundtracks.\n\nMany of Hollywood's versions were exaggerated crime dramas, replete with pimps and drug dealers, which drew heavy criticism in both the white and Black press.\n\n\"What Hollywood did - they suppressed the political message, added caricature - and blaxploitation was born,\" Van Peebles said in 2002. \"The colored intelligentsia were not too happy about it.\"\n\nIn fact, civil rights groups like the NAACP and the Congress of Racial Equality coined the phrase \"blaxploitation\" and formed the Coalition Against Blaxploitation. Among the genre's 21st century fans was Quentin Tarantino, whose Oscar-winning \"Django Unchained\" was openly influenced by blaxploitation films and spaghetti Westerns.\n\nOn Wednesday, a younger generation of Black filmmakers mourned Van Peebles' death. Barry Jenkins, the \"Moonlight\" director, said on Twitter: \"He made the most of every second, of EVERY single damn frame.\"\n\nAfter his initial success, Van Peebles was bombarded with directing offers, but he chose to maintain his independence.\n\n\"I'll only work with them on my terms,\" he said. \"I've whipped the man's ass on his own turf. I'm number one at the box office - which is the way America measures things - and I did it on my own. Now they want me, but I'm in no hurry.\"\n\nVan Peebles then got involved on Broadway, writing and producing several plays and musicals like the Tony-nominated \"Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death\" and \"Don't Play Us Cheap.\" He later wrote the movie \"Greased Lighting\" starring Richard Pryor as Wendell Scott, the first Black race car driver.\n\nIn the 1980s, Van Peebles turned to Wall Street and options trading. He wrote a financial self-help guide entitled \"Bold Money: A New Way to Play the Options Market.\"\n\nBorn Melvin Peebles in Chicago on Aug. 21, 1932, he would later add \"Van\" to his name. He graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University in 1953 and joined the Air Force, serving as a navigator for three years.\n\nAfter military service, he moved to Mexico and worked as a portrait painter, followed by a move to San Francisco, where he started writing short stories and making short films.\n\nVan Peebles soon went to Hollywood, but he was only offered a job as a studio elevator operator. Disappointed, he moved to Holland to take graduate courses in astronomy while also studying at the Dutch National Theatre.\n\nEventually he gave up his studies and moved to Paris, where he learned he could join the French directors' guild if he adapted his own work written in French. He quickly taught himself the language and wrote several novels.\n\nOne he made into a feature film. \"La Permission/The Story of the Three Day Pass,\" was the story of an affair between a Black U.S. soldier and a French woman.

      "text": "The Pittsburgh Courier chronicled history of Black Americans\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) - As a teenager, Robert Lee Vann plowed fields with an ox under the scorching North Carolina sun. But he didn't plant seeds of justice until he came north for an education.\n\nAfter earning bachelor's and law degrees at the University of Pittsburgh, the young attorney began writing in 1910 for a weekly newspaper called The Pittsburgh Courier. His goal, he wrote, was to \"abolish every vestige of Jim Crowism in Pittsburgh.\"\n\nFor more than 40 years, the Courier's crusades laid the groundwork for the civil rights movement and for a time, it had 350,000 readers in the U.S. and overseas. Its journalists advocated for fairer hiring practices, better housing and health care and the integration of workplaces, including the military and sports.\n\n\"The people who worked there liked what they were doing and felt strongly about the mission of the newspaper. They believed in the mission they were on - to do away with Black inequality,\" said Patrick S. Washburn, a retired Ohio University professor and author of \"The African American Newspaper: Voice of Freedom.\"\n\nThe newspaper was \"one of the best things that ever happened to the Black race,\" Ida Grant, the late Courier receptionist, told Ken Love in his 2009 documentary, \"Newspaper of Record: The Pittsburgh Courier.\"\n\nIn barber shops and beauty salons, people passed editions along, learning about prominent leaders in their community worth emulating, politics, society news, crime and the pocketbook issues that affected their daily lives. They read columns by W.E.B. Du Bois, George Schuyler and Frank Bolden, a World War II correspondent.\n\nWith photographer Charles \"Teenie\" Harris, Edna Chappelle McKenzie chronicled the inability of Blacks to enjoy a cup of coffee or a meal in Pittsburgh restaurants. The fashionably dressed Evelyn Cunningham, called \"Big East\" because she was tall and based in Harlem, covered lynchings and introduced readers to a young minister, Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nIn the 1950s, George E. Barbour revealed how few Blacks worked in Pittsburgh and Allegheny County government. During World War II, P.L. Prattis toured segregated camps for the military, detailing the shameful conditions Black soldiers endured in the U.S. while Frank Bolden chronicled the conflict overseas. J.A. Rogers wrote \"Your History,\" a fun feature about Black history with graphic illustrations.\n\nHoused in a brick building with tall windows at 2628 Center Ave. in the Hill District, The Pittsburgh Courier bought its own printing press in 1929. Through its newsroom strode 20th-century greats, including boxer Joe Louis, baseball star Jackie Robinson, labor leader A. Philip Randolph, a future U.S. Supreme Court justice named Thurgood Marshall and entertainers Billy Eckstine, Lena Horne, Nat King Cole and Duke Ellington.\n\nBy the 1930s, Mr. Washburn said, the two biggest influences on Black Americans were ministers, who might reach 5,000 people each week, and the Black press. In that decade, The Pittsburgh Courier averaged 190,000 readers nationwide.\n\nA New Deal\n\nDissatisfied with the Republican Party and President Herbert Hoover's failure to aid Black Americans during the Great Depression, Vann acted in 1932. A lifelong Republican who revered Abraham Lincoln, the publisher and editor wrote a persuasive editorial urging Black voters to turn away from Republicans, vote for Franklin Delano Roosevelt and become New Deal Democrats.\n\nThe editorial, \"This Year I See Millions of Negroes Turning the Picture of Abraham Lincoln to the Wall,\" swayed many Black voters and led them to support Democratic candidates in the 1930s.\n\nIn 1935, when the Courier reached the 100,000 circulation mark, employees signed an edition as it rolled off the presses and gave it to Vann. The following year, circulation more than doubled, partly due to the newspaper's coverage of Italy's invasion of Ethiopia, Joe Louis' victories in the boxing ring, and the Berlin Olympics, where a Black track and field star, Jesse Owens, won four gold medals.\n\nIn the 1940s and '50s, the Courier returned to backing Republican presidential candidates, endorsing Wendell Willkie, Thomas Dewey and Dwight Eisenhower. But it balked at supporting Barry Goldwater in 1964 and endorsed Lyndon Johnson.\n\nWhen Vann died in 1940, his widow, Jessie, took charge, relying on business manager Ira Lewis for financial expertise and newsroom veterans like Bolden and Prattis for guidance.\n\n\"Women were just starting to be able to inherit or run their husband's businesses. There were still states that did not allow women to inherit their husband's business,\" said Pamela E. Walck, an assistant professor in the media department at Duquesne University. She is researching a book tentatively titled \"Voices of The Pittsburgh Courier: Mrs. Robert Vann and the Men and Women of 'America's Best Weekly.'\"\n\nDouble V\n\nA letter from James Gratz Thompson, a 26-year-old Black cafeteria worker in Kansas, prompted the Courier's most successful crusade, its \"Double Victory\" campaign during World War II. While Black soldiers were risking their lives in Europe, Thompson declared war on racism and a lack of opportunity at home.\n\n\"Should I sacrifice my life to live half-American?\" he wrote. \"Would it be too much to demand full citizenship rights in exchange for the sacrificing of my life?\"\n\nThe Double V campaign caught on nationally, said Earnest L. Perry, associate dean for graduate studies and research at the University of Missouri School of Journalism.\n\n\"It helped the Courier supplant the (Chicago) Defender as the leading African American newspaper in the country at that particular time,\" he said.\n\n\"The Courier had bureaus in cities across the country and a dozen state and city special editions. Its writers were stationed in France and England during the war. They had an international audience,\" Ms. Walck said.\n\nAfter America entered World War II, national companies began placing more ads for tobacco, liquor and cars in Black newspapers.\n\n\"They knew there was a market,\" Mr. Perry said. \"Big tobacco has been one of the major national advertisers that has traditionally stuck with the Black press.\"\n\nThe death of Courier business manager Ira Lewis in 1948 was a blow to the newspaper. With the help of loyal staff, Mrs. Vann struggled to keep it afloat during the 1950s. In the early 1960s, she sold a controlling interest in the Courier to S.B. Fuller, a Chicago businessman who made a fortune in cosmetics. His attempt to tone down the paper's advocacy during the rise of the civil rights movement failed.\n\n\"We had so many Black soldiers deployed overseas in World War II. They suddenly realized that the Jim Crow laws that are keeping them down in the U.S. don't exist in other places,\" she said.\n\nAs the movement intensified in the 1960s, mainstream newspapers began hiring Black reporters to cover protests, riots and other events.\n\n\"Major mainstream newspapers were realizing that they needed writers to cover this. They had to compete with television,\" Ms. Walck said.\n\nMeanwhile, large national advertisers were shifting ad dollars back to mainstream media, and Black newspapers foundered.\n\nIn 1963, Mrs. Vann was ousted from the Courier's board of directors. Three years later, John Sengstacke of The Chicago Defender bought the paper and renamed it The New Pittsburgh Courier. Still a weekly, its focus shifted to a local audience.\n\n\"The Pittsburgh community thought it was Jessie who had sold to Sengstacke, that she betrayed the Black community. That's completely off-base,\" Ms. Walck said.\n\nIn the 1960s, '70s and '80s, Black newspapers struggled as mainstream media expanded coverage and advertising revenue continued to decline.\n\n\"They didn't have the capital to be able to turn on a dime - sort of what the legacy media is dealing with right now,\" Mr. Perry said.\n\n\"The National Newspaper Publishers Association has tried to build a national brand for the Black press both from a print standpoint and a digital standpoint, and they are venturing into cable.\"\n\nFew companies or individuals are willing to make a financial commitment to print media, no matter who owns it, Mr. Perry said.\n\n\"In order to be able to make money in the media, you have to invest in it. Very few people or organizations not only have the resources but the willingness to invest in it for the long term. The venture capitalists like Alden Global Capital are not going to do that.\"\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttps://bit.ly/3dU2dKV\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

      "text": "How the Africans Became Black\n\nA Liberian-American reflects on the experiences of Africans who have moved to the United States, a growing community that accounts for 3 percent of the U.S.'s foreign-born population.\n\nA Liberian-American reflects on the experiences of Africans who have moved to the United States, a growing community that accounts for 3 percent of the U.S.'s foreign-born population.\n\nAfter leaving my 9-to-5 job, I was led to a New York Immigration Coalition job posting. While waiting in the coalition's lobby for an interview, a copy of a popular Time Magazine cover caught my eye. WE ARE AMERICANS , the cover read. The photo on the cover featured faces of various brown and yellow immigrants, eager and hopeful, representing both the spirit of America's revolutionary history and its inevitable future. I was remembering my own family's immigration when I stopped to wonder: Where are the Africans?\n\nU.S. immigration debates are overwhelmingly centered on immigrants from Latin America. Proportionately, Mexicans and central Americans far outnumber other immigrant groups in the United States. According to a Migration Policy Institute study, since 1970, \"a period during which the overall U.S. immigration population increased four-fold, the Mexican and central American population increased by a factor of 20.\" In a subsequent study on black immigration, the same organization reported that black African immigrants account for 3 percent of the total U.S. foreign-born population.\n\nLike their Latin American counterparts, African immigrants keep a low profile in an effort to avoid humiliation, deportation, and loss of work. Many of them, whether accidentally or otherwise, wind up blending in with African-American culture. But however closely they may identify with black America, they, too, are immigrants.\n\nTHE IRISH\n\nI recently read a book titled How The Irish Became White by Noel Ignatiev. Ignatiev traces this nation's white solidarity to the arrival of Irish settlers in New York in 1840, the country's subsequent disassociation from its African-American working class-and ultimately, from the African-American race.\n\nAccording to Ignatiev, Irish Catholics, then known as the blacks of Europe, came to America as a disenfranchised, oppressed race under the English Penal Laws. The greatest voice for Catholic emancipation at the time, Daniel O'Connell, urged the new immigrants to continue the struggle for equality in America by showing support for abolitionists. Instead, the Irish realized that discrimination against them by white elites was linked at least in part to their working, sleeping, and living closely alongside blacks of similar economic and social status.\n\nIn order to stand out from blacks economically, Irish immigrants had to monopolize their low-wage jobs and keep free Northern blacks from joining unions during the labor movement. And in order to disassociate socially, they had to consent to active participation in the oppression of the black race, embracing whiteness and the system that disenfranchised and justified an ungovernable hatred toward African-Americans.\n\nIgnatiev includes an 1843 letter from Daniel O'Connell: \"Over the broad Atlantic I pour forth my voice, saying, come out of such land, you Irishmen; or, if you remain, and dare countenance the system of slavery that is supported there, we will recognize you as Irishmen no longer.\"\n\nThe color of their skin saved them, but has also nearly obliterated a once-vibrant cultural identity so that today I know no Irishmen. I have friends of Irish descent, former co-workers who mentioned the occasional Irish grandfather, or associates who gesture toward familiarity of the lost heritage over empty pints on St. Patrick's Day-but the Irishmen are now white, and the Irishmen are now gone.\n\nRace in America is often thought of as a two-toned, immutable palette. No matter how early their ancestors arrived, Americans of Asian descent, Americans from Spanish-speaking countries, and Americans from the Middle East will always be considered foreign, it sometimes seems. For black immigrants who arrive as neither African-American nor white, affiliating with the African-American identity is often easier. Being considered African-American in this country is still better in most instances than being considered an immigrant.\n\nMuch as Irish immigrants benefited from the white racial umbrella, black immigrants are benefiting from a black racial umbrella. They cleave to African-American culture and identity groups and remain silent or unheard in the larger immigration dialogue. In the context of the immigration debate, while many of the prominent faces of those in need are often brown, it's worth remembering that the term immigrant captures black Africans, too. At the same time, black immigrants and their children are also helping to redefine what it means to be black in this country.\n\nON BEING BLACK\n\nWhen I was stopped in Arizona at a checkpoint during a midnight drive from Los Angeles to Houston, I was not asked if I was born in this country or if I was of legal status. The officer glanced at my license and simply asked me where I was going.\n\n\"Home,\" I answered. \"Back to Houston.\"\n\nI sounded like him and looked like about 14 percent of this country-so the officer let me pass. Someone like Natalie Portman-a white woman, but born in Jerusalem and an immigrant to the United States-might have had the same experience.\n\nIf Jose Antonio Vargas, the Pulitzer-winning journalist whose (brown) picture on the cover of Time hung on the wall of the New York Immigration Coalition, were stopped that night, he may have been interrogated with questions, squeezed for identification, for proof that he deserved to be here. How just is that?\n\nMy family left Liberia in 1990 amid the country's first civil war. We were among tens of thousands that successfully escaped to America. Five years old at the time, a green and frightened young immigrant, I moved with my growing family to three different states before settling in Houston in 1994. By then, my accent was gone. I pronounced the r 's at the ends of my words, I knew the radio music my elementary peers sang along to and I could quote the latest episodes of TGIF . By 2000, my only reference to Liberia, other than my parents, annual family reunions, and a war scar underneath my right foot was my name. I said it and people asked if I was African. If I did not say it, they could not know. We were the only African family in our small Texan town and as far as the residents were concerned-we were black. It was not until I moved to New York for college that my answer of \"Spring, Texas\" when people asked me where I was from was unacceptable. \"No,\" they would say, \"where are you from from?\" Oh. Liberia.\n\nLike a small percentage of Liberians, my recent ancestors were descendants of American slaves. A reverend by the name of June Moore immigrated to Liberia with his wife Adeline Moore in 1871. After settling in Arthington, Liberia, Wallace Moore, one of June's and Adeline's three sons, had a son named David Moore, who had a son named Herbert Moore, who had a son named Augustus Moore Sr.-my father.\n\nBut growing up in America as a black or white person encourages the abandonment of such history and the adoption of \"black\" or \"white\" American culture as one's own. Despite my Liberian heritage, my interactions outside of my house during my developmental years took place as though I were, culturally, an African-American-not an African. From first grade through high school, I received an American public-school education in which all mentions of people who looked like me were African-American. I took ownership of the culture because otherwise, I did not exist.\n\nWhen I was 11 years old, I was called a nigger at a neighborhood corner store by a shopkeeper who thought my friends and I were stealing from him when six or so of us entered his store after track practice. The word was foreign to me, as was his motivation in using it. My friends and I cried as we were chased out of the store, but even then I knew their tears came from a different, more familiar place.\n\nIn the same way we respond to someone with white skin-whether that person is a white European or a white Hispanic-so America responds to people with black skin, no matter if they have been here for 20 years or 200 years. Being black in America is accompanied by a stupefying consciousness, a sudden, lifelong awareness of your skin, your nose, your hair-all those things that, ironically, we are taught do not matter at all.\n\nPASSING\n\nStill, developing an awareness of all that being black in this country may entail does not automatically mean that young black immigrants are accepted by their peers. The young immigrant is usually subject to other kinds of bullying. National Geographic programming, comedians, and international news all showcase Africans as savage, disease-ridden, ignorant, and poor. As a young student in this country, an African student, there are few greater burdens than psychologically balancing the public's perception of Africa against what the immigrant knows to be true.\n\nSocial pressures cause a grave, hopeless desire to blend in with peers, even if the price is total rejection of the foods, music, and languages of that child's home country. The easiest avenue for assimilation into American culture, for young black immigrants, is the assimilation into African-American culture. African immigrants are not the only group to do this-Carribeans and black Hispanics may do this as well, all to ease the burdens of cultural ostracism.\n\nThese young people eventually learn to socially navigate both African-American and their home culture. This passing of black immigrants and first-generation black Americans as members of African-American culture results in a cross-cultural black identity, where the individual is equally invested in both African-American interests and the empowerment of their (or their parents') home country and the many issues that affect its native sons.\n\nMy father is a proud man. All of my uncles are proud men. They wear Liberia and her stories on their shoulders and made consistent attempts when I was growing up to engage us in her music and history. Still, my father was as careful as he was proud. My siblings and I were reminded to always obey the law, never get in trouble, to fear punishment and respect authority. The immigration struggles that face many Hispanics in this country-fear of prison, fear of deportation or separation from family-are more intensified among Africans, because many of us, my family included, left countries in conflict or at war. Drawing attention to your immigrant status means raising the possibility of having to return to a country whose economy and infrastructure may barely function.\n\nOurs is also a numbers game. As 3 percent of a foreign-born population, African influence in the immigration movement is low. Language barriers keep some black immigrants from becoming activists. It's not just about English; at one information session in the Bronx, instructions and information on legal clinic appointments were given only in Spanish, even though 10 percent of the attendants were black immigrants who mostly spoke French. The Francophones had to consult with one another to figure out what the session leader was saying.\n\nSome black immigrants are vocal and have received help from a few quarters. To people of countries beset by armed conflict, natural disaster, or other circumstances that would make going home unsafe, the United States grants what's called Temporary Protected Status (TPS). TPS gives certain foreign nationals a special opportunity to live in America, to work, to pay taxes, and to own homes and businesses. Haitians benefited from this after the 2010 earthquake, and Liberians were also beneficiaries.\n\nBut in 2007, an estimated 4,000 Liberians were told that their special status would expire on September 30 at midnight. On September 12, however, President George W. Bush signed a bill that gave the Liberians permission to stay another 18 months and continue working. That reprieve has since been granted four times; yet every year these Liberians-some with children who are American citizens, homeowners, and taxpayers-face the threat of deportation.\n\nLiberian nationals, with the help of the Universal Human Rights International Group and community associations led and managed by fellow Liberian immigrants, continue to lobby Congress for permanent residency. Michael Capuano, a Democratic U.S. congressman from Massachusetts, is a co-sponsor of the Liberian Refugee Immigration Protection Act. If passed, the bipartisan bill will allow Liberians with TPS to apply for permanent residency, something they are not currently allowed to do.\n\nYou may have passed a Liberian covered by TPS today. You may have thought that he was just black.\n\nWhat the Irish were to white identity in the 19th century, so are African immigrants to African-American identity today. Black immigrants have a meaningful contribution to make to the immigration debate; for Jose Antonio Vargas and the other brown faces on that Time cover, the black immigrant voice may be all the push reformists need."

      "text": "The 'African Giant' Challenging Musical Boundaries\n\nWith a new album, a solo track on Beyoncé's Lion King compilation, and a global fan base, Burna Boy is pushing the limits imposed on artists from the continent.\n\nI n January, when Coachella announced the lineup for its annual music festival in California, the Nigerian-born singer Burna Boy-one of only two African artists set to perform-quickly reacted to the placement of his name on the promotional materials . \"I really appreciate you,\" he wrote in an Instagram Story after the poster reveal. \"But I don't appreciate the way my name is written so small in your bill. I am an AFRICAN GIANT and will not be reduced to whatever that tiny writing means. Fix tings quick please.\"\n\nAt the time, the Afro-fusion singer's dramatic response to the perceived slight earned him some light criticism from those (fans included) who thought the Instagram post betrayed an outsized ego, even for a musician. But when Coachella didn't amend the flyers, Burna Boy doubled down: His label sent press a reimagined festival poster-one that listed his name in place of all the other performers. Soon afterward, he announced the \"African Giant\" tour and the title of his forthcoming album-you guessed it- African Giant . (Onstage at Coachella in April, he eschewed the ire in favor of crowd-centric ebullience, especially when performing alongside his fellow Nigerian artist Mr Eazi.)\n\nIn person, a week before African Giant 's release, Burna Boy carried himself with all the casual bravado his self-appointed nickname suggests. The singer, born Damini Ogulu, leaned back in his seat as we spoke, pausing often to smoke or flash a diamond-encrusted smile. When I asked about the choice to lean in to the grandiose moniker, he was adamant that the name points to something bigger than his own ego: \"It's just something that I consider a fact, [being] No. 1,\" the singer said of his musical standing on the continent as we talked in Brooklyn. \"An American artist can come to Africa and rap his English rap with his slangs that we don't even get, but we say it.\"\n\n\"Why didn't he change his language to make us understand him better?\" Burna asked me, then returned my response- Because Americans aren't expected to adapt to different audiences -with a reply that I took to be more self-evident than arrogant: \"So why do I have to?\"\n\nFor all of the jokes about Burna's braggadocio, the Coachella dustup does point to a larger issue: African artists, even those with followings the size of Burna's and Eazi's, are continually underestimated and mischaracterized by American music-industry gatekeepers. Coachella, long considered a launching pad for indie artists' careers , boasts a remarkably diverse array of musicians each year. Even so, Burna and Eazi were among its first two Africa-based performers, 20 years into the festival's existence. (The Nigerian singer Wizkid, for one, was slated to appear in 2018, but visa issues kept him from attending .) That delay echoes an industry-wide concern based chiefly on misconceptions about African music.\n\nBurna's music, for example, is most intuitively categorized as \"Afro-fusion,\" which encompasses a melange of influences including pop, R&B, dancehall, reggae, and Afrobeat, the latter genre pioneered by the late Nigerian legend Fela Kuti. The 28-year-old Burna often sings in Yoruba and welcomes comparisons to Kuti, whom he cites as an inspiration. (Sometimes he does this quite cheekily: On \"Streets of Africa,\" a stellar track from his 2018 mixtape, Outside , Burna calls himself \"Fela Kuti with the hoes,\" a reference to Kuti's notorious womanizing.) The link between the two isn't incidental: Burna's grandfather managed the late singer, whose music-alongside American artists such as DMX, Jay-Z, and Wu-Tang Clan, and Jamaican artists such as Vybz Kartel and Buju Banton-soundtracked Burna's early years in Port Harcourt, Nigeria.\n\nBut in the West, Kuti's Afrobeat has taken on a more nebulous afterlife. American and British music arbiters tend to lazily label much of the modern music emerging from Africa, and especially West Africa, \"Afrobeats.\" Though the umbrella term has made for easy categorization, it strips African artists of their musical distinctions. \"When people say 'Afrobeats,' they're talking about Nigerian pop music. It's a name that was basically created just to take all of this different Nigerian music and package it together so that it could be digestible and distributable,\" Tunde Ogundipe, Spotify's global lead of African music and culture, told me earlier this week. \"Those that coined the term, they don't really care for accuracy or historical context.\"\n\nAfrican Giant implicitly challenges the limits imposed on artists from the continent. Burna's most cohesive and expansive record to date, African Giant is musically diverse and narratively challenging. It includes features from frequent collaborators such as the 24-year-old Nigerian rapper Zlatan, while placing Burna solidly within a long African musical legacy. The album's most notable feature, for instance, is from Angélique Kidjo, the 59-year-old Beninese American singer who's been called \"Africa's premier diva.\"\n\n\"Different,\" the African Giant track on which Kidjo sings, also includes a verse from the reggae exemplar Damian Marley. Still, it was the Kidjo feature that exhilarated Burna. \"That's really the one person where it's like I personally sought [her] out to make that happen. I looked. I've actually looked for her for years,\" he said. \"When I say years, I mean like 2011. Years .\" When an A&R representative at Universal Music Group helped connect the two, the characteristically nonchalant Burna was beside himself: \"She's the first person I've spoken to on the phone and I was almost shaking ... It's a big honor to me.\"\n\nT he singer's early years in southern Nigeria were fraught, characterized by what he often glibly categorizes as \"street culture.\" It's a shorthand for any number of wayward behaviors (including some run-ins with the law), but his wins feel hard-earned. Nothing about his rise is, as Western publications have erroneously labeled it, a \"surprise.\"\n\nOutside Nigeria and the continent, Burna's music first made waves in the United Kingdom, which boasts a large Nigerian and Afro-diasporic population. It's become a second home to Burna, who resides in London. The U.K. is where his debut studio album, 2013's L.I.F.E. ( Leaving an Impact for Eternity ), and its energetic single, \"Like to Party,\" first found a broad audience. In the years since, he's produced music at a prolific rate, spending countless nights (always nights, he specified to me, laughing at his inability to wake up early) in the studio.\n\nHis next two records-2015's On a Spaceship and 2016's Redemption -showcased an artist well aware of his lyrical prowess and marketability. With 2018's Outside , Burna established himself as a formidable musical peer, collaborating with artists such as J Hus and Lily Allen. His dedication to various dimensions of his craft is clear, too: \"Ye,\" for example, is an eminently sing-along-friendly track that also cleverly positions Burna as an inheritor of homegrown musical genius. At one point, referencing the dreadlocks that fall over his face, he observes people \"calling me Lagbaja,\" the famed Afrobeat musician who performed in masks.\n\nLagbaja, like Kuti, looms large over Burna, whose turn toward social storytelling on African Giant draws largely from the lessons of his childhood. \"My grandfather had a statue of a fist in the middle of the house, so I had to grow up to that,\" he said with a laugh. \"He kinda made me dig more into the history of where I come from and all of that.\" Of the role music played in that extracurricular education, he noted that sociopolitical change and artistic production have often been symbiotic endeavors: \"When something happens in Africa, an artist will sing about it and stuff. We have all the records; we have everything. Free Mandela records and all that.\"\n\nOn African Giant tracks such as the M.anifest-assisted \"Another Story,\" which begins with a radio dispatch explaining Nigeria's colonial history, Burna readily steps into the role of national storyteller. \"I'm 28 years old. In my country, that's considered very young. It's almost like the youth don't matter to the up-and-ups,\" he said, referring to the nation's elders. He wants to infuse his music with lessons about the past in part because, as he told me, \"everybody that's in power has been there since we gained independence in 1960.\" He continued: \"Why would you blame the youth for not knowing certain history? You can't blame them or call them dumb [when the elders keep the history to themselves] ... As they say, knowledge is power. So I just felt the need to kinda let people of my age group and younger in on some little history that I am [pretty] sure that almost 90 percent of us have no clue about.\"\n\nH ours after we spoke, Burna took the stage a few miles over, at Brooklyn's Prospect Park. In front of several thousand people, he sang and danced with an energy that appeared unaffected by the punishing heat. Summarizing his onstage magnetism is difficult, but Burna himself managed to. At one point, he asked the crowd who the \"real lion king\" was, a cocky reference to the release that very day of the CGI remake of the film-and to the fact that he has a song, the only solo song by an African performer, on the Beyoncé-curated album that accompanies the movie .\n\nWatching him perform, hypnotizing concertgoers with almost impossible ease, I was reminded of what he'd said to me earlier: \"Going onstage-that's my joy. You know like when you're in school and you're just waiting for the bell to go off so you can leave the class and go and play outside? That's me in life.\"\n\nThat exuberance infuses African Giant , too. The album incorporates a potent emphasis on national record-keeping while maintaining the sultry, atmospheric quality that Burna's early records established. Tucked among odes to Nigerian defiance, for example, African Giant includes a standout collaboration with the Jamaican dancehall artist Serani and the American R&B singer Jeremih, and a woozy R&B bop with the British singer Jorja Smith. The project showcases Burna at his strongest: versatile, melodic, and confident. It's the product of a musician who's ready to be taken seriously beyond his core demographic without sacrificing the influences that shaped him.\n\nAfrican Giant also includes collaborations with two mega-popular American rappers, the Los Angeles-bred YG and the Atlanta phenom Future. Listening to the tracks, it's hard not to think about the speech Burna's mother, Bose Ogulu, gave after he won Best International Act (an admittedly dubious category) at the BET Awards earlier this year. Accepting the accolade in his stead, \"Mama Burna\" drew a direct through line from Burna's music to that of the other artists in the room. \"Thank you very much, BET. Thank you, Africa, because that is the constituency for which we got noticed in the first place,\" she said. \"And the message from Burna, I believe, would be that every black person should please remember that you were Africans before you became anything else.\" (Burna samples her speech on \"Spiritual,\" the album's final track. African Giant literally ends with her words.)\n\nFor Burna, a rapidly expanding platform in the United States and Europe has meant not just commercial success, but also an opportunity to highlight the connective tissue that spans varying genres of black music. He's ready to collaborate with the Jamaican reggae singer Koffee , who covered \"Ye\" with near-perfect Yoruba tonality-and whom he called his \"spiritual little sister\" when we spoke. He mused that he's excited about \"the reconnection of the black race.\" The ambition is a lofty one, but Burna feels it all coming together. Or as he said about having Future and YG on tracks that signal a distinctly Nigerian sound, \"It's almost like bringing my brothers home.\""

      "text": "My President Was Black\n\nA history of the first African American White House-and of what came next\n\n\"They're a rotten crowd,\" I shouted across the lawn. \"You're worth the whole damn bunch put together.\"\n\n- F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby\n\nIn the waning days of President Barack Obama's administration, he and his wife, Michelle, hosted a farewell party, the full import of which no one could then grasp. It was late October, Friday the 21st, and the president had spent many of the previous weeks, as he would spend the two subsequent weeks, campaigning for the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. Things were looking up. Polls in the crucial states of Virginia and Pennsylvania showed Clinton with solid advantages. The formidable GOP strongholds of Georgia and Texas were said to be under threat. The moment seemed to buoy Obama. He had been light on his feet in these last few weeks, cracking jokes at the expense of Republican opponents and laughing off hecklers. At a rally in Orlando on October 28, he greeted a student who would be introducing him by dancing toward her and then noting that the song playing over the loudspeakers-the Gap Band's \"Outstanding\"-was older than she was. \"This is classic!\" he said. Then he flashed the smile that had launched America's first black presidency, and started dancing again. Three months still remained before Inauguration Day, but staffers had already begun to count down the days. They did this with a mix of pride and longing-like college seniors in early May. They had no sense of the world they were graduating into. None of us did.\n\nThe farewell party, presented by BET (Black Entertainment Television), was the last in a series of concerts the first couple had hosted at the White House. Guests were asked to arrive at 5:30 p.m. By 6, two long lines stretched behind the Treasury Building, where the Secret Service was checking names. The people in these lines were, in the main, black, and their humor reflected it. The brisker queue was dubbed the \"good-hair line\" by one guest, and there was laughter at the prospect of the Secret Service subjecting us all to a \"brown-paper-bag test.\" This did not come to pass, but security was tight. Several guests were told to stand in a makeshift pen and wait to have their backgrounds checked a second time.\n\nListen to the audio version of this article: Download the Audm app for your iPhone to listen to more titles.\n\nDave Chappelle was there. He coolly explained the peril and promise of comedy in what was then still only a remotely potential Donald Trump presidency: \"I mean, we never had a guy have his own pussygate scandal.\" Everyone laughed. A few weeks later, he would be roundly criticized for telling a crowd at the Cutting Room, in New York, that he had voted for Clinton but did not feel good about it. \"She's going to be on a coin someday,\" Chappelle said. \"And her behavior has not been coinworthy.\" But on this crisp October night, everything felt inevitable and grand. There was a slight wind. It had been in the 80s for much of that week. Now, as the sun set, the season remembered its name. Women shivered in their cocktail dresses. Gentlemen chivalrously handed over their suit coats. But when Naomi Campbell strolled past the security pen in a sleeveless number, she seemed as invulnerable as ever.\n\nCellphones were confiscated to prevent surreptitious recordings from leaking out. (This effort was unsuccessful. The next day, a partygoer would tweet a video of the leader of the free world dancing to Drake's \"Hotline Bling.\") After withstanding the barrage of security, guests were welcomed into the East Wing of the White House, and then ushered back out into the night, where they boarded a succession of orange-and-green trolleys. The singer and actress Janelle Monáe, her famous and fantastic pompadour preceding her, stepped on board and joked with a companion about the historical import of \"sitting in the back of the bus.\" She took a seat three rows from the front and hummed into the night. The trolley dropped the guests on the South Lawn, in front of a giant tent. The South Lawn's fountain was lit up with blue lights. The White House proper loomed like a ghost in the distance. I heard the band, inside, beginning to play Al Green's \"Let's Stay Together.\"\n\n\"Well, you can tell what type of night this is,\" Obama said from the stage, opening the event. \"Not the usual ruffles and flourishes!\"\n\nThe crowd roared.\n\n\"This must be a BET event!\"\n\nThe crowd roared louder still.\n\nObama placed the concert in the White House's musical tradition, noting that guests of the Kennedys had once done the twist at the residence-\"the twerking of their time,\" he said, before adding, \"There will be no twerking tonight. At least not by me.\"\n\nThe Obamas are fervent and eclectic music fans. In the past eight years, they have hosted performances at the White House by everyone from Mavis Staples to Bob Dylan to Tony Bennett to the Blind Boys of Alabama. After the rapper Common was invited to perform in 2011, a small fracas ensued in the right-wing media. He performed anyway-and was invited back again this glorious fall evening and almost stole the show. The crowd sang along to the hook for his hit ballad \"The Light.\" And when he brought on the gospel singer Yolanda Adams to fill in for John Legend on the Oscar-winning song \"Glory,\" glee turned to rapture.\n\nDe La Soul was there. The hip-hop trio had come of age as boyish B-boys with Gumby-style high-top fades. Now they moved across the stage with a lovely mix of lethargy and grace, like your favorite uncle making his way down the Soul Train line, wary of throwing out a hip. I felt a sense of victory watching them rock the crowd, all while keeping it in the pocket. The victory belonged to hip-hop-an art form birthed in the burning Bronx and now standing full grown, at the White House, unbroken and unedited. Usher led the crowd in a call-and-response: \"Say it loud, I'm black and I'm proud.\" Jill Scott showed off her operatic chops. Bell Biv DeVoe, contemporaries of De La, made history with their performance by surely becoming the first group to suggest to a presidential audience that one should \"never trust a big butt and a smile.\"\n\nThe ties between the Obama White House and the hip-hop community are genuine. The Obamas are social with Beyoncé and Jay-Z. They hosted Chance the Rapper and Frank Ocean at a state dinner, and last year invited Swizz Beatz, Busta Rhymes, and Ludacris, among others, to discuss criminal-justice reform and other initiatives. Obama once stood in the Rose Garden passing large flash cards to the Hamilton creator and rapper Lin-Manuel Miranda, who then freestyled using each word on the cards. \"Drop the beat,\" Obama said, inaugurating the session. At 55, Obama is younger than pioneering hip-hop artists like Afrika Bambaataa, DJ Kool Herc, and Kurtis Blow. If Obama's enormous symbolic power draws primarily from being the country's first black president, it also draws from his membership in hip-hop's foundational generation.\n\nThat night, the men were sharp in their gray or black suits and optional ties. Those who were not in suits had chosen to make a statement, like the dark-skinned young man who strolled in, sockless, with blue jeans cuffed so as to accentuate his gorgeous black-suede loafers. Everything in his ensemble seemed to say, \"My fellow Americans, do not try this at home.\" There were women in fur jackets and high heels; others with sculpted naturals, the sides shaved close, the tops blooming into curls; others still in gold bamboo earrings and long blond dreads. When the actor Jesse Williams took the stage, seemingly awed before such black excellence, before such black opulence, assembled just feet from where slaves had once toiled, he simply said, \"Look where we are. Look where we are right now.\"\n\nThis would not happen again, and everyone knew it. It was not just that there might never be another African American president of the United States. It was the feeling that this particular black family, the Obamas, represented the best of black people, the ultimate credit to the race, incomparable in elegance and bearing. \"There are no more,\" the comedian Sinbad joked back in 2010. \"There are no black men raised in Kansas and Hawaii. That's the last one. Y'all better treat this one right. The next one gonna be from Cleveland. He gonna wear a perm. Then you gonna see what it's really like.\" Throughout their residency, the Obamas had refrained from showing America \"what it's really like,\" and had instead followed the first lady's motto, \"When they go low, we go high.\" This was the ideal-black and graceful under fire-saluted that evening. The president was lionized as \"our crown jewel.\" The first lady was praised as the woman \"who put the O in Obama .\"\n\nBarack Obama's victories in 2008 and 2012 were dismissed by some of his critics as merely symbolic for African Americans. But there is nothing \"mere\" about symbols. The power embedded in the word nigger is also symbolic. Burning crosses do not literally raise the black poverty rate, and the Confederate flag does not directly expand the wealth gap.\n\nMuch as the unbroken ranks of 43 white male presidents communicated that the highest office of government in the country-indeed, the most powerful political offices in the world-was off-limits to black individuals, the election of Barack Obama communicated that the prohibition had been lifted. It communicated much more. Before Obama triumphed in 2008, the most-famous depictions of black success tended to be entertainers or athletes. But Obama had shown that it was \"possible to be smart and cool at the same damn time,\" as Jesse Williams put it at the BET party. Moreover, he had not embarrassed his people with a string of scandals. Against the specter of black pathology, against the narrow images of welfare moms and deadbeat dads, his time in the White House had been an eight-year showcase of a healthy and successful black family spanning three generations, with two dogs to boot. In short, he became a symbol of black people's everyday, extraordinary Americanness.\n\nWhiteness in America is a different symbol-a badge of advantage. In a country of professed meritocratic competition, this badge has long ensured an unerring privilege, represented in a 220-year monopoly on the highest office in the land. For some not-insubstantial sector of the country, the elevation of Barack Obama communicated that the power of the badge had diminished. For eight long years, the badge-holders watched him. They saw footage of the president throwing bounce passes and shooting jumpers. They saw him enter a locker room, give a businesslike handshake to a white staffer, and then greet Kevin Durant with something more soulful. They saw his wife dancing with Jimmy Fallon and posing, resplendent, on the covers of magazines that had, only a decade earlier, been almost exclusively, if unofficially, reserved for ladies imbued with the great power of the badge.\n\nFor the preservation of the badge, insidious rumors were concocted to denigrate the first black White House. Obama gave free cellphones to disheveled welfare recipients. Obama went to Europe and complained that \"ordinary men and women are too small-minded to govern their own affairs.\" Obama had inscribed an Arabic saying on his wedding ring, then stopped wearing the ring, in observance of Ramadan. He canceled the National Day of Prayer; refused to sign certificates for Eagle Scouts; faked his attendance at Columbia University; and used a teleprompter to address a group of elementary-school students. The badge-holders fumed. They wanted their country back. And, though no one at the farewell party knew it, in a couple of weeks they would have it.\n\nOn this October night, though, the stage belonged to another America. At the end of the party, Obama looked out into the crowd, searching for Dave Chappelle. \"Where's Dave?\" he cried. And then, finding him, the president referenced Chappelle's legendary Brooklyn concert. \"You got your block party. I got my block party.\" Then the band struck up Al Green's \"Love and Happiness\"-the evening's theme. The president danced in a line next to Ronnie DeVoe. Together they mouthed the lyrics: \"Make you do right. Love will make you do wrong.\"\n\nLast spring , I went to the White House to meet the president for lunch. I arrived slightly early and sat in the waiting area. I was introduced to a deaf woman who worked as the president's receptionist, a black woman who worked in the press office, a Muslim woman in a head scarf who worked on the National Security Council, and an Iranian American woman who worked as a personal aide to the president. This receiving party represented a healthy cross section of the people Donald Trump had been mocking, and would continue to spend his campaign mocking. At the time, the president seemed untroubled by Trump. When I told Obama that I thought Trump's candidacy was an explicit reaction to the fact of a black president, he said he could see that, but then enumerated other explanations. When assessing Trump's chances, he was direct: He couldn't win.\n\nSubscribe to The Atlantic and support 160 years of independent journalism\n\nThis assessment was born out of the president's innate optimism and unwavering faith in the ultimate wisdom of the American people-the same traits that had propelled his unlikely five-year ascent from assemblyman in the Illinois state legislature to U.S. senator to leader of the free world. The speech that launched his rise, the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, emerged right from this logic. He addressed himself to his \"fellow Americans, Democrats, Republicans, independents,\" all of whom, he insisted, were more united than they had been led to believe. America was home to devout worshippers and Little League coaches in blue states, civil libertarians and \"gay friends\" in red states. The presumably white \"counties around Chicago\" did not want their taxes burned on welfare, but they didn't want them wasted on a bloated Pentagon budget either. Inner-city black families, no matter their perils, understood \"that government alone can't teach our kids to learn ... that children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white.\"\n\nPerceived differences were the work of \"spinmasters and negative-ad peddlers who embrace the politics of 'anything goes.' \" Real America had no use for such categorizations. By Obama's lights, there was no liberal America, no conservative America, no black America, no white America, no Latino America, no Asian America, only \"the United States of America.\" All these disparate strands of the American experience were bound together by a common hope:\n\nThis speech ran counter to the history of the people it sought to address. Some of those same immigrants had firebombed the homes of the children of those same slaves. That young naval lieutenant was an imperial agent for a failed, immoral war. American division was real. In 2004, John Kerry did not win a single southern state. But Obama appealed to a belief in innocence-in particular a white innocence-that ascribed the country's historical errors more to misunderstanding and the work of a small cabal than to any deliberate malevolence or widespread racism. America was good. America was great.\n\nOver the next 12 years, I came to regard Obama as a skilled politician, a deeply moral human being, and one of the greatest presidents in American history. He was phenomenal-the most agile interpreter and navigator of the color line I had ever seen. He had an ability to emote a deep and sincere connection to the hearts of black people, while never doubting the hearts of white people. This was the core of his 2004 keynote, and it marked his historic race speech during the 2008 campaign at Philadelphia's National Constitution Center-and blinded him to the appeal of Trump. (\"As a general proposition, it's hard to run for president by telling people how terrible things are,\" Obama once said to me.)\n\nBut if the president's inability to cement his legacy in the form of Hillary Clinton proved the limits of his optimism, it also revealed the exceptional nature of his presidential victories. For eight years Barack Obama walked on ice and never fell. Nothing in that time suggested that straight talk on the facts of racism in American life would have given him surer footing.\n\nI had met the president a few times before. In his second term, I'd written articles criticizing him for his overriding trust in color-blind policy and his embrace of \"personal responsibility\" rhetoric when speaking to African Americans. I saw him as playing both sides. He would invoke his identity as a president of all people to decline to advocate for black policy-and then invoke his black identity to lecture black people for continuing to \"make bad choices.\" In response, Obama had invited me, along with other journalists, to the White House for off-the-record conversations. I attempted to press my points in these sessions. My efforts were laughable and ineffective. I was always inappropriately dressed, and inappropriately calibrated in tone: In one instance, I was too deferential; in another, too bellicose. I was discombobulated by fear-not by fear of the power of his office (though that is a fearsome and impressive thing) but by fear of his obvious brilliance. It is said that Obama speaks \"professorially,\" a fact that understates the quickness and agility of his mind. These were not like press conferences-the president would speak in depth and with great familiarity about a range of subjects. Once, I watched him effortlessly reply to queries covering everything from electoral politics to the American economy to environmental policy. And then he turned to me. I thought of George Foreman, who once booked an exhibition with multiple opponents in which he pounded five straight journeymen-and I suddenly had some idea of how it felt to be the last of them.\n\nLast spring, we had a light lunch. We talked casually and candidly. He talked about the brilliance of LeBron James and Stephen Curry-not as basketball talents but as grounded individuals. I asked him whether he was angry at his father, who had abandoned him at a young age to move back to Kenya, and whether that motivated any of his rhetoric. He said it did not, and he credited the attitude of his mother and grandparents for this. Then it was my turn to be autobiographical. I told him that I had heard the kind of \"straighten up\" talk he had been giving to black youth, for instance in his 2013 Morehouse commencement address, all my life. I told him that I thought it was not sensitive to the inner turmoil that can be obscured by the hardness kids often evince. I told him I thought this because I had once been one of those kids. He seemed to concede this point, but I couldn't tell whether it mattered to him. Nonetheless, he agreed to a series of more formal conversations on this and other topics.\n\nThe improbability of a black president had once been so strong that its most vivid representations were comedic. Witness Dave Chappelle's profane Black Bush from the early 2000s (\"This nigger very possibly has weapons of mass destruction! I can't sleep on that!\") or Richard Pryor's black president in the 1970s promising black astronauts and black quarterbacks (\"Ever since the Rams got rid of James Harris, my jaw's been uptight!\"). In this model, so potent is the force of blackness that the presidency is forced to conform to it. But once the notion advanced out of comedy and into reality, the opposite proved to be true.\n\nObama's DNC speech is the key. It does not belong to the literature of \"the struggle\"; it belongs to the literature of prospective presidents-men (as it turns out) who speak not to gravity and reality, but to aspirations and dreams. When Lincoln invoked the dream of a nation \"conceived in liberty\" and pledged to the ideal that \"all men are created equal,\" he erased the near-extermination of one people and the enslavement of another. When Roosevelt told the country that \"the only thing we have to fear is fear itself,\" he invoked the dream of American omnipotence and boundless capability. But black people, then living under a campaign of terror for more than half a century, had quite a bit to fear, and Roosevelt could not save them. The dream Ronald Reagan invoked in 1984-that \"it's morning again in America\"-meant nothing to the inner cities, besieged as they were by decades of redlining policies, not to mention crack and Saturday-night specials. Likewise, Obama's keynote address conflated the slave and the nation of immigrants who profited from him. To reinforce the majoritarian dream, the nightmare endured by the minority is erased. That is the tradition to which the \"skinny kid with a funny name\" who would be president belonged. It is also the only tradition in existence that could have possibly put a black person in the White House.\n\nObama's embrace of white innocence was demonstrably necessary as a matter of political survival. Whenever he attempted to buck this directive, he was disciplined. His mild objection to the arrest of Henry Louis Gates Jr. in 2009 contributed to his declining favorability numbers among whites-still a majority of voters. His comments after the killing of Trayvon Martin-\"If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon\"-helped make that tragedy a rallying point for people who did not care about Martin's killer as much as they cared about finding ways to oppose the president. Michael Tesler, a political-science professor at UC Irvine, has studied the effect of Obama's race on the American electorate. \"No other factor, in fact, came close to dividing the Democratic primary electorate as powerfully as their feelings about African Americans,\" he and his co-author, David O. Sears, concluded in their book, Obama's Race: The 2008 Election and the Dream of a Post-Racial America . \"The impact of racial attitudes on individual vote decisions ... was so strong that it appears to have even outstripped the substantive impact of racial attitudes on Jesse Jackson's more racially charged campaign for the nomination in 1988.\" When Tesler looked at the 2012 campaign in his second book, Post-Racial or Most-Racial? Race and Politics in the Obama Era , very little had improved. Analyzing the extent to which racial attitudes affected people associated with Obama during the 2012 election, Tesler concluded that \"racial attitudes spilled over from Barack Obama into mass assessments of Mitt Romney, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Charlie Crist, and even the Obama family's dog Bo.\"\n\nYet despite this entrenched racial resentment, and in the face of complete resistance by congressional Republicans, overtly launched from the moment Obama arrived in the White House, the president accomplished major feats. He remade the nation's health-care system. He revitalized a Justice Department that vigorously investigated police brutality and discrimination, and he began dismantling the private-prison system for federal inmates. Obama nominated the first Latina justice to the Supreme Court, gave presidential support to marriage equality, and ended the U.S. military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, thus honoring the civil-rights tradition that had inspired him. And if his very existence inflamed America's racist conscience, it also expanded the country's anti-racist imagination. Millions of young people now know their only president to have been an African American. Writing for The New Yorker , Jelani Cobb once noted that \"until there was a black Presidency it was impossible to conceive of the limitations of one.\" This is just as true of the possibilities. In 2014, the Obama administration committed itself to reversing the War on Drugs through the power of presidential commutation. The administration said that it could commute the sentences of as many as 10,000 prisoners. As of November, the president had commuted only 944 sentences. By any measure, Obama's effort fell woefully short, except for this small one: the measure of almost every other modern president who preceded him. Obama's 944 commutations are the most in nearly a century-and more than the past 11 presidents' combined.\n\nObama was born into a country where laws barring his very conception-let alone his ascendancy to the presidency-had long stood in force. A black president would always be a contradiction for a government that, throughout most of its history, had oppressed black people. The attempt to resolve this contradiction through Obama-a black man with deep roots in the white world-was remarkable. The price it exacted, incredible. The world it gave way to, unthinkable.\n\nWhen Barack Obama was 10, his father gave him a basketball, a gift that connected the two directly. Obama was born in 1961 in Hawaii and raised by his mother, Ann Dunham, who was white, and her parents, Stanley and Madelyn. They loved him ferociously, supported him emotionally, and encouraged him intellectually. They also told him he was black. Ann gave him books to read about famous black people. When Obama's mother had begun dating his father, the news had not been greeted with the threat of lynching (as it might have been in various parts of the continental United States), and Obama's grandparents always spoke positively of his father. This biography makes Obama nearly unique among black people of his era.\n\nIn the president's memoir, Dreams From My Father , he says he was not an especially talented basketball player, but he played with a consuming passion. That passion was directed at something more than just the mastering of the pick-and-roll or the perfecting of his jump shot. Obama came of age during the time of the University of Hawaii basketball team's \"Fabulous Five\"-a name given to its all-black starting five, two decades before it would be resurrected at the University of Michigan by the likes of Chris Webber and Jalen Rose. In his memoir, Obama writes that he would watch the University of Hawaii players laughing at \"some inside joke,\" winking \"at the girls on the sidelines,\" or \"casually flipping lay-ups.\" What Obama saw in the Fabulous Five was not just game, but a culture he found attractive:\n\nThese are lessons, particularly the last one, that for black people apply as much on the street as they do on the court. Basketball was a link for Obama, a medium for downloading black culture from the mainland that birthed the Fabulous Five. Assessing his own thought process at the time, Obama writes, \"I decided to become part of that world.\" This is one of the most incredible sentences ever written in the long, decorated history of black memoir, if only because very few black people have ever enjoyed enough power to write it.\n\nHistorically, in black autobiography, to be remanded into the black race has meant exposure to a myriad of traumas, often commencing in childhood. Frederick Douglass is separated from his grandmother. The enslaved Harriet Ann Jacobs must constantly cope with the threat of rape before she escapes. After telling his teacher he wants to be a lawyer, Malcolm X is told that the job isn't for \"niggers.\" Black culture often serves as the balm for such traumas, or even the means to resist them. Douglass finds the courage to face the \"slave-breaker\" Edward Covey after being given an allegedly enchanted root by \"a genuine African\" possessing powers from \"the eastern nations.\" Malcolm X's dancing connects him to his \"long-suppressed African instincts.\" If black racial identity speaks to all the things done to people of recent African ancestry, black cultural identity was created in response to them. The division is not neat; the two are linked, and it is incredibly hard to be a full participant in the world of cultural identity without experiencing the trauma of racial identity.\n\nObama is somewhat different. He writes of bloodying the nose of a white kid who called him a \"coon,\" and of chafing at racist remarks from a tennis coach, and of feeling offended after a white woman in his apartment building told the manager that he was following her. But the kinds of traumas that marked African Americans of his generation-beatings at the hands of racist police, being herded into poor schools, grinding out a life in a tenement building-were mostly abstract for him. Moreover, the kind of spatial restriction that most black people feel at an early age-having rocks thrown at you for being on the wrong side of the tracks, for instance-was largely absent from his life. In its place, Obama was gifted with a well-stamped passport and admittance to elite private schools-all of which spoke of other identities, other lives and other worlds where the color line was neither determinative nor especially relevant. Obama could have grown into a raceless cosmopolitan. Surely he would have lived in a world of problems, but problems not embodied by him.\n\nInstead, he decided to enter this world.\n\n\"I always felt as if being black was cool,\" Obama told me while traveling to a campaign event. He was sitting on Air Force One , his tie loosened, his shirtsleeves rolled up. \"[Being black] was not something to run away from but something to embrace. Why that is, I think, is complicated. Part of it is I think that my mother thought black folks were cool, and if your mother loves you and is praising you-and says you look good, are smart-as you are, then you don't kind of think in terms of How can I avoid this? You feel pretty good about it.\"\n\nAs a child, Obama's embrace of blackness was facilitated, not impeded, by white people. Obama's mother pointed him toward the history and culture of African Americans. Stanley, his grandfather, who came originally from Kansas, took him to basketball games at the University of Hawaii, as well as to black bars. Stanley introduced him to the black writer Frank Marshall Davis. The facilitation was as much indirect as direct. Obama recalls watching his grandfather at those black bars and understanding that \"most of the people in the bar weren't there out of choice,\" and that \"our presence there felt forced.\" From his mother's life of extensive travel, he learned to value the significance of having a home.\n\nThat suspicion of rootlessness extends throughout Dreams From My Father . He describes integration as a \"one-way street\" on which black people are asked to abandon themselves to fully experience America's benefits. Confronted with a woman named Joyce, a mixed-race, green-eyed college classmate who insists that she is not \"black\" but \"multiracial,\" Obama is scornful. \"That was the problem with people like Joyce,\" he writes. \"They talked about the richness of their multicultural heritage and it sounded real good, until you noticed that they avoided black people.\" Later in the memoir, Obama tells the story of falling in love with a white woman. During a visit to her family's country house, he found himself in the library, which was filled with pictures of the woman's illustrious relations. But instead of being in awe, Obama realized that he and the woman lived in different worlds. \"And I knew that if we stayed together, I'd eventually live in hers,\" he writes. \"Between the two of us, I was the one who knew how to live as an outsider.\"\n\nAfter college, Obama found a home, as well as a sense of himself, working on the South Side of Chicago as a community organizer. \"When I started doing that work, my story merges with a larger story. That happens naturally for a John Lewis,\" he told me, referring to the civil-rights hero and Democratic congressman. \"That happens more naturally for you. It was less obvious to me. How do I pull all these different strains together: Kenya and Hawaii and Kansas, and white and black and Asian-how does that fit? And through action, through work, I suddenly see myself as part of the bigger process for, yes, delivering justice for the [African American community] and specifically the South Side community, the low-income people-justice on behalf of the African American community. But also thereby promoting my ideas of justice and equality and empathy that my mother taught me were universal. So I'm in a position to understand those essential parts of me not as separate and apart from any particular community but connected to every community. And I can fit the African American struggle for freedom and justice in the context of the universal aspiration for freedom and justice.\"\n\nThroughout Obama's 2008 campaign and into his presidency, this attitude proved key to his deep support in the black community. African Americans, weary of high achievers who distanced themselves from their black roots, understood that Obama had paid a price for checking \"black\" on his census form, and for living black, for hosting Common, for brushing dirt off his shoulder during the primaries, for marrying a woman who looked like Michelle Obama. If women, as a gender, must suffer the constant evaluations and denigrations of men, black women must suffer that, plus a broad dismissal from the realm of what American society deems to be beautiful. But Michelle Obama is beautiful in the way that black people know themselves to be. Her prominence as first lady directly attacks a poison that diminishes black girls from the moment they are capable of opening a magazine or turning on a television.\n\nThe South Side of Chicago, where Obama began his political career, is home to arguably the most prominent and storied black political establishment in the country. In addition to Oscar Stanton De Priest, the first African American elected to Congress in the 20th century, the South Side produced the city's first black mayor, Harold Washington; Jesse Jackson, who twice ran for president; and Carol Moseley Braun, the first African American woman to win a Senate race. These victories helped give rise to Obama's own. Harold Washington served as an inspiration to Obama and looms heavily over the Chicago section of Dreams From My Father .\n\nWashington forged the kind of broad coalition that Obama would later assemble nationally. But Washington did this in the mid-1980s in segregated Chicago, and he had not had the luxury, as Obama did, of becoming black with minimal trauma. \"There was an edge to Harold that frightened some white voters,\" David Axelrod, who worked for both Washington and Obama, told me recently. Axelrod recalled sitting around a conference table with Washington after he had won the Democratic primary for his reelection in 1987, just as the mayor was about to hold a press conference. Washington asked what percentage of Chicago's white vote he'd received. \"And someone said, 'Well, you got 21 percent. And that's really good because last time' \"-in his successful 1983 mayoral campaign-\" 'you only got 8,' \" Axelrod recalled. \"And he kind of smiled, sadly, and said, 'You know, I probably spent 70 percent of my time in those white neighborhoods, and I think I've been a good mayor for everybody, and I got 21 percent of the white vote and we think it's good.' And he just kind of shook his head and said, 'Ain't it a bitch to be a black man in the land of the free and the home of the brave?'\n\n\"That was Harold. He felt those things. He had fought in an all-black unit in World War II. He had come up in times-and that and the sort of indignities of what you had to do to come up through the machine really seared him.\" During his 1983 mayoral campaign, Washington was loudly booed outside a church in northwest Chicago by middle-class Poles, Italians, and Irish, who feared blacks would uproot them. \"It was as vicious and ugly as anything you would have seen in the old South,\" Axelrod said.\n\nObama's ties to the South Side tradition that Washington represented were complicated. Like Washington, Obama attempted to forge a coalition between black South Siders and the broader community. But Obama, despite his adherence to black cultural mores, was, with his roots in Kansas and Hawaii, his Ivy League pedigree, and his ties to the University of Chicago, still an exotic out-of-towner. \"They were a bit skeptical of him,\" says Salim Muwakkil, a journalist who has covered Obama since before his days in the Illinois state Senate. \"Chicago is a very insular community, and he came from nowhere, seemingly.\"\n\nObama compounded people's suspicions by refusing to humble himself and go along with the political currents of the South Side. \"A lot of the politicians, especially the black ones, were just leery of him,\" Kaye Wilson, the godmother to Obama's children and one of the president's earliest political supporters, told me recently.\n\nBut even as many in the black political community were skeptical of Obama, others encouraged him-sometimes when they voted against him. When Obama lost the 2000 Democratic-primary race against Bobby Rush, the African American incumbent congressman representing Illinois' First Congressional District, the then-still-obscure future president experienced the defeat as having to do more with his age than his exoticism. \"I'd go meet people and I'd knock on doors and stuff, and some of the grandmothers who were the folks I'd been organizing and working with doing community stuff, they weren't parroting back some notion of 'You're too Harvard,' or 'You're too Hyde Park,' or what have you,\" Obama told me. \"They'd say, 'You're a wonderful young man, you're going to do great things. You just have to be patient.' So I didn't feel the loss as a rejection by black people. I felt the loss as 'politics anywhere is tough.' Politics in Chicago is especially tough. And being able to break through in the African American community is difficult because of the enormous loyalty that people feel towards anybody who has been around awhile.\"\n\nThere was no one around to compete for loyalty when Obama ran for Senate in 2004, or for president in 2008. He was no longer competing against other African Americans; he was representing them. \"He had that hybridity which told the 'do-gooders'-in Chicago they call the reformers the do-gooders-that he was acceptable,\" Muwakkil told me.\n\nObama ran for the Senate two decades after the death of Harold Washington. Axelrod checked in on the precinct where Washington had been so loudly booed by white Chicagoans. \"Obama carried, against seven candidates for the Senate, almost the entire northwest side and that precinct,\" he said. \"And I told him, 'Harold's smiling down on us tonight.' \"\n\nObama believes that his statewide victory for the Illinois Senate seat held particular portent for the events of 2008. \"Illinois is the most demographically representative state in the country,\" he told me. \"If you took all the percentages of black, white, Latino; rural, urban; agricultural, manufacturing-[if] you took that cross section across the country and you shrank it, it would be Illinois.\"\n\nIllinois effectively allowed Obama to play a scrimmage before the big national game in 2008. \"When I ran for the Senate I had to go into southern Illinois, downstate Illinois, farming communities-some with very tough racial histories, some areas where there just were no African Americans of any number,\" Obama told me. \"And when we won that race, not just an African American from Chicago, but an African American with an exotic history and [the] name Barack Hussein Obama, [it showed that I] could connect with and appeal to a much broader audience.\"\n\nThe mix of Obama's \"hybridity\" and the changing times allowed him to extend his appeal beyond the white ethnic corners of Chicago, past the downstate portions of Illinois, and out into the country at large. \"Ben Nelson, one of the most conservative Democrats in the Senate, from Nebraska, would only bring in one national Democrat to campaign for him,\" Obama recalls. \"And it was me. And so part of the reason I was willing to run [for president in 2008] was that I had had two years in which we were generating enormous crowds all across the country-and the majority of those crowds were not African American; and they were in pretty remote places, or unlikely places. They weren't just big cities or they weren't just liberal enclaves. So what that told me was, it was possible.\"\n\nWhat those crowds saw was a black candidate unlike any other before him. To simply point to Obama's white mother, or to his African father, or even to his rearing in Hawaii, is to miss the point. For most African Americans, white people exist either as a direct or an indirect force for bad in their lives. Biraciality is no shield against this; often it just intensifies the problem. What proved key for Barack Obama was not that he was born to a black man and a white woman, but that his white family approved of the union, and approved of the child who came from it. They did this in 1961-a time when sex between black men and white women, in large swaths of the country, was not just illegal but fraught with mortal danger. But that danger is not part of Obama's story. The first white people he ever knew, the ones who raised him, were decent in a way that very few black people of that era experienced.\n\nI asked Obama what he made of his grandparents' impressively civilized reception of his father. \"It wasn't Harry Belafonte,\" Obama said laughingly of his father. \"This was like an African African. And he was like a blue-black brother. Nilotic. And so, yeah, I will always give my grandparents credit for that. I'm not saying they were happy about it. I'm not saying that they were not, after the guy leaves, looking at each other like, 'What the heck?' But whatever misgivings they had, they never expressed to me, never spilled over into how they interacted with me.\n\n\"Now, part of it, as I say in my book, was we were in this unique environment in Hawaii where I think it was much easier. I don't know if it would have been as easy for them if they were living in Chicago at the time, because the lines just weren't as sharply drawn in Hawaii as they were on the mainland.\"\n\nObama's early positive interactions with his white family members gave him a fundamentally different outlook toward the wider world than most blacks of the 1960s had. Obama told me he rarely had \"the working assumption of discrimination, the working assumption that white people would not treat me right or give me an opportunity or judge me [other than] on the basis of merit.\" He continued, \"The kind of working assumption\" that white people would discriminate against him or treat him poorly \"is less embedded in my psyche than it is, say, with Michelle.\"\n\nIn this, the first lady is more representative of black America than her husband is. African Americans typically raise their children to protect themselves against a presumed hostility from white teachers, white police officers, white supervisors, and white co-workers. The need for that defense is, more often than not, reinforced either directly by actual encounters or indirectly by observing the vast differences between one's own experience and those across the color line. Marty Nesbitt, the president's longtime best friend, who, like Obama, had positive interactions with whites at a relatively early age, told me that when he and his wife went to buy their first car, she was insistent on buying from a black salesperson. \"I'm like, 'We've got to find a salesman,' \" Nesbitt said. \"She's like, 'No, no, no. We're waiting for the brother.' And I'm like, 'He's with a customer.' They were filling out documents and she was like, 'We're going to stay around.' And a white guy came up to us. 'Can I help you?' 'Nope.' \" Nesbitt was not out to condemn anyone with this story. He was asserting that \"the willingness of African Americans [in Chicago] to help lift each other up is powerful.\"\n\nBut that willingness to help is also a defense, produced by decades of discrimination. Obama sees race through a different lens, Kaye Wilson told me. \"It's just very different from ours,\" she explained. \"He's got buddies that are white, and they're his buddies, and they love him. And I don't think they love him just because he's the president. They love him because they're his friends from Hawaii, some from college and all.\n\n\"So I think he's got that, whereas I think growing up in the racist United States, we enter this thing with, you know, 'I'm looking at you. I'm not trusting you to be one hundred with me.' And I think he grew up in a way that he had to trust [white people]-how can you live under the roof with people and think that they don't love you? He needs that frame of reference. He needs that lens. If he didn't have it, it would be ... a Jesse Jackson, you know? Or Al Sharpton. Different lens.\"\n\nThat lens, born of literally relating to whites, allowed Obama to imagine that he could be the country's first black president. \"If I walked into a room and it's a bunch of white farmers, trade unionists, middle age-I'm not walking in thinking, Man, I've got to show them that I'm normal ,\" Obama explained. \"I walk in there, I think, with a set of assumptions: like, these people look just like my grandparents. And I see the same Jell‐O mold that my grandmother served, and they've got the same, you know, little stuff on their mantelpieces. And so I am maybe disarming them by just assuming that we're okay.\"\n\nWhat Obama was able to offer white America is something very few African Americans could-trust. The vast majority of us are, necessarily, too crippled by our defenses to ever consider such a proposition. But Obama, through a mixture of ancestral connections and distance from the poisons of Jim Crow, can credibly and sincerely trust the majority population of this country. That trust is reinforced, not contradicted, by his blackness. Obama isn't shuffling before white power (Herman Cain's \"shucky ducky\" act) or flattering white ego (O. J. Simpson's listing not being seen as black as a great accomplishment). That, too, is defensive, and deep down, I suspect, white people know it. He stands firm in his own cultural traditions and says to the country something virtually no black person can, but every president must: \"I believe you.\"\n\nJust after Columbus Day , I accompanied the president and his formidable entourage on a visit to North Carolina A&T State University, in Greensboro. Four days earlier, The Washington Post had published an old audio clip that featured Donald Trump lamenting a failed sexual conquest and exhorting the virtues of sexual assault. The next day, Trump claimed that this was \"locker room\" talk. As we flew to North Carolina, the president was in a state of bemused disbelief. He plopped down in a chair in the staff cabin of Air Force One and said, \"I've been in a lot of locker rooms. I don't think I've ever heard that one before.\" He was casual and relaxed. A feeling of cautious inevitability emanated from his staff, and why not? Every day seemed to bring a new, more shocking revelation or piece of evidence showing Trump to be unfit for the presidency: He had lost nearly $1 billion in a single year. He had likely not paid taxes in 18 years. He was running a \"university,\" for which he was under formal legal investigation. He had trampled on his own campaign's messaging by engaging in a Twitter crusade against a former beauty-pageant contestant. He had been denounced by leadership in his own party, and the trickle of prominent Republicans-both in and out of office-who had publicly repudiated him threatened to become a geyser. At this moment, the idea that a campaign so saturated in open bigotry, misogyny, chaos, and possible corruption could win a national election was ludicrous. This was America.\n\nThe president was going to North Carolina to keynote a campaign rally for Clinton, but first he was scheduled for a conversation about My Brother's Keeper, his initiative on behalf of disadvantaged youth. Announcing My Brother's Keeper-or MBK, as it's come to be called-in 2014, the president had sought to avoid giving the program a partisan valence, noting that it was \"not some big new government program.\" Instead, it would involve the government in concert with the nonprofit and business sectors to intervene in the lives of young men of color who were \"at risk.\" MBK serves as a kind of network for those elements of federal, state, and local government that might already have a presence in the lives of these young men. It is a quintessentially Obama program-conservative in scope, with impacts that are measurable.\n\n\"It comes right out of his own life,\" Broderick Johnson, the Cabinet secretary and an assistant to the president, who heads MBK, told me recently. \"I have heard him say, 'I don't want us to have a bunch of forums on race.' He reminds people, 'Yeah, we can talk about this. But what are we going to do ?' \" On this afternoon in North Carolina, what Obama did was sit with a group of young men who'd turned their lives around in part because of MBK. They told stories of being in the street, of choosing quick money over school, of their homes being shot up, and-through the help of mentoring or job programs brokered by MBK-transitioning into college or a job. Obama listened solemnly and empathetically to each of them. \"It doesn't take that much,\" he told them. \"It just takes someone laying hands on you and saying, 'Hey, man, you count.' \"\n\nWhen he asked the young men whether they had a message he should take back to policy makers in Washington, D.C., one observed that despite their best individual efforts, they still had to go back to the very same deprived neighborhoods that had been the sources of trouble for them. \"It's your environment,\" the young man said. \"You can do what you want, but you still gotta go back to the hood.\"\n\nHe was correct. The ghettos of America are the direct result of decades of public-policy decisions: the redlining of real-estate zoning maps, the expanded authority given to prosecutors, the increased funding given to prisons. And all of this was done on the backs of people still reeling from the 250-year legacy of slavery. The results of this negative investment are clear-African Americans rank at the bottom of nearly every major socioeconomic measure in the country.\n\nObama's formula for closing this chasm between black and white America, like that of many progressive politicians today, proceeded from policy designed for all of America. Blacks disproportionately benefit from this effort, since they are disproportionately in need. The Affordable Care Act, which cut the uninsured rate in the black community by at least a third, was Obama's most prominent example. Its full benefit has yet to be felt by African Americans, because several states in the South have declined to expand Medicaid. But when the president and I were meeting, the ACA's advocates believed that pressure on state budgets would force expansion, and there was evidence to support this: Louisiana had expanded Medicaid earlier in 2016, and advocates were gearing up for wars to be waged in Georgia and Virginia.\n\nObama also emphasized the need for a strong Justice Department with a deep commitment to nondiscrimination. When Obama moved into the White House in 2009, the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division \"was in shambles,\" former Attorney General Eric Holder told me recently. \"I mean, I had been there for 12 years as a line guy. I started out in '76, so I served under Republicans and Democrats. And what the [George W.] Bush administration, what the Bush DOJ did, was unlike anything that had ever happened before in terms of politicized hiring.\" The career civil servants below the political appointees, Holder said, were not even invited to the meetings in which the key hiring and policy decisions were made. After Obama's inauguration, Holder told me, \"I remember going to tell all the folks at the Civil Rights Division, 'The Civil Rights Division is open for business again.' The president gave me additional funds to hire people.\"\n\nThe political press developed a narrative that because Obama felt he had to modulate his rhetoric on race, Holder was the administration's true, and thus blacker, conscience. Holder is certainly blunter, and this worried some of the White House staff. Early in Obama's first term, Holder gave a speech on race in which he said the United States had been a \"nation of cowards\" on the subject. But positioning the two men as opposites elides an important fact: Holder was appointed by the president, and went only as far as the president allowed. I asked Holder whether he had toned down his rhetoric after that controversial speech. \"Nope,\" he said. Reflecting on his relationship with the president, Holder said, \"We were also kind of different people, you know? He is the Zen guy. And I'm kind of the hot-blooded West Indian. And I thought we made a good team, but there's nothing that I ever did or said that I don't think he would have said, 'I support him 100 percent.'\n\n\"Now, the 'nation of cowards' speech, the president might have used a different phrase-maybe, probably. But he and I share a worldview, you know? And when I hear people say, 'Well, you are blacker than him' or something like that, I think, What are you all talking about? \"\n\nFor much of his presidency, a standard portion of Obama's speeches about race riffed on black people's need to turn off the television, stop eating junk food, and stop blaming white people for their problems. Obama would deliver this lecture to any black audience, regardless of context. It was bizarre, for instance, to see the president warning young men who'd just graduated from Morehouse College, one of the most storied black colleges in the country, about making \"excuses\" and blaming whites.\n\nThis part of the Obama formula is the most troubling, and least thought-out. This judgment emerges from my own biography. I am the product of black parents who encouraged me to read, of black teachers who felt my work ethic did not match my potential, of black college professors who taught me intellectual rigor. And they did this in a world that every day insulted their humanity. It was not so much that the black layabouts and deadbeats Obama invoked in his speeches were unrecognizable. I had seen those people too. But I'd also seen the same among white people. If black men were overrepresented among drug dealers and absentee dads of the world, it was directly related to their being underrepresented among the Bernie Madoffs and Kenneth Lays of the world. Power was what mattered, and what characterized the differences between black and white America was not a difference in work ethic, but a system engineered to place one on top of the other.\n\nThe mark of that system is visible at every level of American society, regardless of the quality of one's choices. For instance, the unemployment rate among black college graduates (4.1 percent) is almost the same as the unemployment rate among white high-school graduates (4.6 percent). But that college degree is generally purchased at a higher price by blacks than by whites. According to research by the Brookings Institution, African Americans tend to carry more student debt four years after graduation ($53,000 versus $28,000) and suffer from a higher default rate on their loans (7.6 percent versus 2.4 percent) than white Americans. This is both the result and the perpetuator of a sprawling wealth gap between the races. White households, on average, hold seven times as much wealth as black households-a difference so large as to make comparing the \"black middle class\" and \"white middle class\" meaningless; they're simply not comparable. According to Patrick Sharkey, a sociologist at New York University who studies economic mobility, black families making $100,000 a year or more live in more-disadvantaged neighborhoods than white families making less than $30,000. This gap didn't just appear by magic; it's the result of the government's effort over many decades to create a pigmentocracy-one that will continue without explicit intervention.\n\nObama had been on the record as opposing reparations. But now, late in his presidency, he seemed more open to the idea-in theory, at least, if not in practice.\n\n\"Theoretically, you can make obviously a powerful argument that centuries of slavery, Jim Crow, discrimination are the primary cause for all those gaps,\" Obama said, referencing the gulf in education, wealth, and employment that separates black and white America. \"That those were wrongs to the black community as a whole, and black families specifically, and that in order to close that gap, a society has a moral obligation to make a large, aggressive investment, even if it's not in the form of individual reparations checks but in the form of a Marshall Plan.\"\n\nThe political problems with turning the argument for reparations into reality are manifold, Obama said. \"If you look at countries like South Africa, where you had a black majority, there have been efforts to tax and help that black majority, but it hasn't come in the form of a formal reparations program. You have countries like India that have tried to help untouchables, with essentially affirmative-action programs, but it hasn't fundamentally changed the structure of their societies. So the bottom line is that it's hard to find a model in which you can practically administer and sustain political support for those kinds of efforts.\"\n\nObama went on to say that it would be better, and more realistic, to get the country to rally behind a robust liberal agenda and build on the enormous progress that's been made toward getting white Americans to accept nondiscrimination as a basic operating premise. But the progress toward nondiscrimination did not appear overnight. It was achieved by people willing to make an unpopular argument and live on the frontier of public opinion. I asked him whether it wasn't-despite the practical obstacles-worth arguing that the state has a collective responsibility not only for its achievements but for its sins.\n\n\"I want my children-I want Malia and Sasha-to understand that they've got responsibilities beyond just what they themselves have done,\" Obama said. \"That they have a responsibility to the larger community and the larger nation, that they should be sensitive to and extra thoughtful about the plight of people who have been oppressed in the past, are oppressed currently. So that's a wisdom that I want to transmit to my kids ... But I would say that's a high level of enlightenment that you're looking to have from a majority of the society. And it may be something that future generations are more open to, but I am pretty confident that for the foreseeable future, using the argument of nondiscrimination, and 'Let's get it right for the kids who are here right now,' and giving them the best chance possible, is going to be a more persuasive argument.\"\n\nObama is unfailingly optimistic about the empathy and capabilities of the American people. His job necessitates this: \"At some level what the people want to feel is that the person leading them sees the best in them,\" he told me. But I found it interesting that that optimism does not extend to the possibility of the public's accepting wisdoms-such as the moral logic of reparations-that the president, by his own account, has accepted for himself and is willing to teach his children. Obama says he always tells his staff that \"better is good.\" The notion that a president would attempt to achieve change within the boundaries of the accepted consensus is appropriate. But Obama is almost constitutionally skeptical of those who seek to achieve change outside that consensus.\n\nEarly in 2016, Obama invited a group of African American leaders to meet with him at the White House. When some of the activists affiliated with Black Lives Matter refused to attend, Obama began calling them out in speeches. \"You can't refuse to meet because that might compromise the purity of your position,\" he said. \"The value of social movements and activism is to get you at the table, get you in the room, and then start trying to figure out how is this problem going to be solved. You then have a responsibility to prepare an agenda that is achievable-that can institutionalize the changes you seek-and to engage the other side.\"\n\nOpal Tometi, a Nigerian American community activist who is one of the three founders of Black Lives Matter, explained to me that the group has a more diffuse structure than most civil-rights organizations. One reason for this is to avoid the cult of personality that has plagued black organizations in the past. So the founders asked its membership in Chicago, the president's hometown, whether they should meet with Obama. \"They felt-and I think many of our members felt-there wouldn't be the depth of discussion that they wanted to have,\" Tometi told me. \"And if there wasn't that space to have a real heart-to-heart, and if it was just surface level, that it would be more of a disservice to the movement.\"\n\nTometi noted that some other activists allied with Black Lives Matter had been planning to attend the meeting, so they felt their views would be represented. Nevertheless, Black Lives Matter sees itself as engaged in a protest against the treatment of black people by the American state, and so Tometi and much of the group's leadership, concerned about being used for a photo op by the very body they were protesting, opted not to go.\n\nWhen I asked Obama about this perspective, he fluctuated between understanding where the activists were coming from and being hurt by such brush-offs. \"I think that where I've gotten frustrated during the course of my presidency has never been because I was getting pushed too hard by activists to see the justness of a cause or the essence of an issue,\" he said. \"I think where I got frustrated at times was the belief that the president can do anything if he just decides he wants to do it. And that sort of lack of awareness on the part of an activist about the constraints of our political system and the constraints on this office, I think, sometimes would leave me to mutter under my breath. Very rarely did I lose it publicly. Usually I'd just smile.\"\n\nHe laughed, then continued, \"The reason I say that is because those are the times where sometimes you feel actually a little bit hurt. Because you feel like saying to these folks, '[Don't] you think if I could do it, I [would] have just done it? Do you think that the only problem is that I don't care enough about the plight of poor people, or gay people?' \"\n\nI asked Obama whether he thought that perhaps protesters' distrust of the powers that be could ultimately be healthy. \"Yes,\" he said. \"Which is why I don't get too hurt. I mean, I think there is a benefit to wanting to hold power's feet to the fire until you actually see the goods. I get that. And I think it is important. And frankly, sometimes it's useful for activists just to be out there to keep you mindful and not get complacent, even if ultimately you think some of their criticism is misguided.\"\n\nObama himself was an activist and a community organizer, albeit for only two years-but he is not, by temperament, a protester. He is a consensus-builder; consensus, he believes, ultimately drives what gets done. He understands the emotional power of protest, the need to vent before authority-but that kind of approach does not come naturally to him. Regarding reparations, he said, \"Sometimes I wonder how much of these debates have to do with the desire, the legitimate desire, for that history to be recognized. Because there is a psychic power to the recognition that is not satisfied with a universal program; it's not satisfied by the Affordable Care Act, or an expansion of Pell Grants, or an expansion of the earned-income tax credit.\" These kinds of programs, effective and disproportionately beneficial to black people though they may be, don't \"speak to the hurt, and the sense of injustice, and the self-doubt that arises out of the fact that [African Americans] are behind now, and it makes us sometimes feel as if there must be something wrong with us-unless you're able to see the history and say, 'It's amazing we got this far given what we went through.'\n\n\"So in part, I think the argument sometimes that I've had with folks who are much more interested in sort of race-specific programs is less an argument about what is practically achievable and sometimes maybe more an argument of 'We want society to see what's happened and internalize it and answer it in demonstrable ways.' And those impulses I very much understand-but my hope would be that as we're moving through the world right now, we're able to get that psychological or emotional peace by seeing very concretely our kids doing better and being more hopeful and having greater opportunities.\"\n\nObama saw-at least at that moment, before the election of Donald Trump-a straight path to that world. \"Just play this out as a thought experiment,\" he said. \"Imagine if you had genuine, high-quality early-childhood education for every child, and suddenly every black child in America-but also every poor white child or Latino [child], but just stick with every black child in America-is getting a really good education. And they're graduating from high school at the same rates that whites are, and they are going to college at the same rates that whites are, and they are able to afford college at the same rates because the government has universal programs that say that you're not going to be barred from school just because of how much money your parents have.\n\n\"So now they're all graduating. And let's also say that the Justice Department and the courts are making sure, as I've said in a speech before, that when Jamal sends his résumé in, he's getting treated the same as when Johnny sends his résumé in. Now, are we going to have suddenly the same number of CEOs, billionaires, etc., as the white community? In 10 years? Probably not, maybe not even in 20 years.\n\n\"But I guarantee you that we would be thriving, we would be succeeding. We wouldn't have huge numbers of young African American men in jail. We'd have more family formation as college-graduated girls are meeting boys who are their peers, which then in turn means the next generation of kids are growing up that much better. And suddenly you've got a whole generation that's in a position to start using the incredible creativity that we see in music, and sports, and frankly even on the streets, channeled into starting all kinds of businesses. I feel pretty good about our odds in that situation.\"\n\nThe thought experiment doesn't hold up. The programs Obama favored would advance white America too-and without a specific commitment to equality, there is no guarantee that the programs would eschew discrimination. Obama's solution relies on a goodwill that his own personal history tells him exists in the larger country. My own history tells me something different. The large numbers of black men in jail, for instance, are not just the result of poor policy, but of not seeing those men as human.\n\nWhen President Obama and I had this conversation, the target he was aiming to reach seemed to me to be many generations away, and now-as President-Elect Trump prepares for office-seems even many more generations off. Obama's accomplishments were real: a $1 billion settlement on behalf of black farmers, a Justice Department that exposed Ferguson's municipal plunder, the increased availability of Pell Grants (and their availability to some prisoners), and the slashing of the crack/cocaine disparity in sentencing guidelines, to name just a few. Obama was also the first sitting president to visit a federal prison. There was a feeling that he'd erected a foundation upon which further progressive policy could be built. It's tempting to say that foundation is now endangered. The truth is, it was never safe.\n\nObama's greatest misstep was born directly out of his greatest insight. Only Obama, a black man who emerged from the best of white America, and thus could sincerely trust white America, could be so certain that he could achieve broad national appeal. And yet only a black man with that same biography could underestimate his opposition's resolve to destroy him. In some sense an Obama presidency could never have succeeded along the normal presidential lines; he needed a partner, or partners, in Congress who could put governance above party. But he struggled to win over even some of his own allies. Ben Nelson, the Democratic senator from Nebraska whom Obama helped elect, became an obstacle to health-care reform. Joe Lieberman, whom Obama saved from retribution at the hands of Senate Democrats after Lieberman campaigned for Obama's 2008 opponent, John McCain, similarly obstructed Obamacare. Among Republicans, senators who had seemed amenable to Obama's agenda-Chuck Grassley, Susan Collins, Richard Lugar, Olympia Snowe-rebuffed him repeatedly.\n\nThe obstruction grew out of narrow political incentives. \"If Republicans didn't cooperate,\" Obama told me, \"and there was not a portrait of bipartisan cooperation and a functional federal government, then the party in power would pay the price and they could win back the Senate and/or the House. That wasn't an inaccurate political calculation.\"\n\nObama is not sure of the degree to which individual racism played into this calculation. \"I do remember watching Bill Clinton get impeached and Hillary Clinton being accused of killing Vince Foster,\" he said. \"And if you ask them, I'm sure they would say, 'No, actually what you're experiencing is not because you're black, it's because you're a Democrat.' \"\n\nBut personal animus is just one manifestation of racism; arguably the more profound animosity occurs at the level of interests. The most recent Congress boasted 138 members from the states that comprised the old Confederacy. Of the 101 Republicans in that group, 96 are white and one is black. Of the 37 Democrats, 18 are black and 15 are white. There are no white congressional Democrats in the Deep South. Exit polls in Mississippi in 2008 found that 96 percent of voters who described themselves as Republicans were white. The Republican Party is not simply the party of whites, but the preferred party of whites who identify their interest as defending the historical privileges of whiteness. The researchers Josh Pasek, Jon A. Krosnick, and Trevor Tompson found that in 2012, 32 percent of Democrats held antiblack views, while 79 percent of Republicans did. These attitudes could even spill over to white Democratic politicians, because they are seen as representing the party of blacks. Studying the 2016 election, the political scientist Philip Klinkner found that the most predictive question for understanding whether a voter favored Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump was \"Is Barack Obama a Muslim?\"\n\nIn our conversations, Obama said he didn't doubt that there was a sincerely nonracist states'-rights contingent of the GOP. And yet he suspected that there might be more to it. \"A rudimentary knowledge of American history tells you that the relationship between the federal government and the states was very much mixed up with attitudes towards slavery, attitudes towards Jim Crow, attitudes towards antipoverty programs and who benefited and who didn't,\" he said.\n\n\"And so I'm careful not to attribute any particular resistance or slight or opposition to race. But what I do believe is that if somebody didn't have a problem with their daddy being employed by the federal government, and didn't have a problem with the Tennessee Valley Authority electrifying certain communities, and didn't have a problem with the interstate highway system being built, and didn't have a problem with the GI Bill, and didn't have a problem with the [Federal Housing Administration] subsidizing the suburbanization of America, and that all helped you build wealth and create a middle class-and then suddenly as soon as African Americans or Latinos are interested in availing themselves of those same mechanisms as ladders into the middle class, you now have a violent opposition to them-then I think you at least have to ask yourself the question of how consistent you are, and what's different, and what's changed.\"\n\nRacism greeted Obama in both his primary and general-election campaigns in 2008. Photos were circulated of him in Somali garb. Rush Limbaugh dubbed him \"Barack the Magic Negro.\" Roger Stone, who would go on to advise the Trump campaign, claimed that Michelle Obama could be heard on tape yelling \"Whitey.\" Detractors circulated emails claiming that the future first lady had written a racist senior thesis while at Princeton. A fifth of all West Virginia Democratic-primary voters in 2008 openly admitted that race had influenced their vote. Hillary Clinton trounced him 67 to 26 percent.\n\nAfter Obama won the presidency in defiance of these racial headwinds, traffic to the white-supremacist website Stormfront increased sixfold. Before the election, in August, just before the Democratic National Convention, the FBI uncovered an assassination plot hatched by white supremacists in Denver. Mainstream conservative publications floated the notion that Obama's memoir was too \"stylish and penetrating\" to have been written by the candidate, and found a plausible ghostwriter in the radical (and white) former Weatherman Bill Ayers. A Republican women's club in California dispensed \"Obama Bucks\" featuring slices of watermelon, ribs, and fried chicken. At the Values Voter Summit that year, conventioneers hawked \"Obama Waffles,\" a waffle mix whose box featured a bug-eyed caricature of the candidate. Fake hip-hop lyrics were scrawled on the side (\"Barry's Bling Bling Waffle Ring\") and on the top, the same caricature was granted a turban and tagged with the instructions \"Point box toward Mecca for tastier waffles.\" The display was denounced by the summit's sponsor, the Family Research Council. One would be forgiven for meeting this denunciation with guffaws: The council's president, Tony Perkins, had once addressed the white-supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens with a Confederate flag draped behind him. By 2015, Perkins had deemed the debate over Obama's birth certificate \"legitimate\" and was saying that it \"makes sense\" to conclude that Obama was actually a Muslim.\n\nBy then, birtherism-inflamed in large part by a real-estate mogul and reality-TV star named Donald Trump-had overtaken the Republican rank and file. In 2015, one poll found that 54 percent of GOP voters thought Obama was a Muslim. Only 29 percent believed he'd been born in America.\n\nStill, in 2008, Obama had been elected. His supporters rejoiced. As Jay-Z commemorated the occasion:\n\nNot quite. A month after Obama entered the White House, a CNBC personality named Rick Santelli took to the trading floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and denounced the president's efforts to help homeowners endangered by the housing crisis. \"How many of you people want to pay for your neighbor's mortgage that has an extra bathroom and can't pay their bills?,\" Santelli asked the assembled traders. He asserted that Obama should \"reward people that could carry the water\" as opposed to those who \"drink the water,\" and denounced those in danger of foreclosure as \"losers.\" Race was implicit in Santelli's harangue-the housing crisis and predatory lending had devastated black communities and expanded the wealth gap-and it culminated with a call for a \"Tea Party\" to resist the Obama presidency. In fact, right-wing ideologues had been planning just such a resistance for decades. They would eagerly answer Santelli's call.\n\nOne of the intellectual forerunners of the Tea Party is said to be Ron Paul, the heterodox two-time Republican presidential candidate, who opposed the war in Iraq and championed civil liberties. On other matters, Paul was more traditional. Throughout the '90s, he published a series of racist newsletters that referred to New York City as \"Welfaria,\" called Martin Luther King Jr. Day \"Hate Whitey Day,\" and asserted that 95 percent of black males in Washington, D.C., were either \"semi-criminal or entirely criminal.\" Paul's apologists have claimed that he had no real connection to the newsletters, even though virtually all of them were published in his name (\"The Ron Paul Survival Report,\" \"Ron Paul Political Report,\" \"Dr. Ron Paul's Freedom Report\") and written in his voice. Either way, the views of the newsletters have found their expression in his ideological comrades. Throughout Obama's first term, Tea Party activists voiced their complaints in racist terms. Activists brandished signs warning that Obama would implement \"white slavery,\" waved the Confederate flag, depicted Obama as a witch doctor, and issued calls for him to \"go back to Kenya.\" Tea Party supporters wrote \"satirical\" letters in the name of \"We Colored People\" and stoked the flames of birtherism. One of the Tea Party's most prominent sympathizers, the radio host Laura Ingraham, wrote a racist tract depicting Michelle Obama gorging herself on ribs, while Glenn Beck said the president was a \"racist\" with a \"deep-seated hatred for white people.\" The Tea Party's leading exponent, Andrew Breitbart, engineered the smearing of Shirley Sherrod, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's director of rural development for Georgia, publishing egregiously misleading videos that wrongly made her appear to be engaging in antiwhite racist invective, which led to her dismissal. (In a rare act of cowardice, the Obama administration cravenly submitted to this effort.)\n\nIn those rare moments when Obama made any sort of comment attacking racism, firestorms threatened to consume his governing agenda. When, in July 2009, the president objected to the arrest of the eminent Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. while he was trying to get into his own house, pointing out that the officer had \"acted stupidly,\" a third of whites said the remark made them feel less favorably toward the president, and nearly two-thirds claimed that Obama had \"acted stupidly\" by commenting. A chastened Obama then determined to make sure his public statements on race were no longer mere riffs but designed to have an achievable effect. This was smart, but still the invective came. During Obama's 2009 address on health care before a joint session of Congress, Joe Wilson, a Republican congressman from South Carolina, incredibly, and in defiance of precedent and decorum, disrupted the proceedings by crying out \"You lie!\" A Missouri congressman equated Obama with a monkey. A California GOP official took up the theme and emailed her friends an image depicting Obama as a chimp, with the accompanying text explaining, \"Now you know why [there's] no birth certificate!\" Former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin assessed the president's foreign policy as a \"shuck and jive shtick.\" Newt Gingrich dubbed him the \"food-stamp president.\" The rhetorical attacks on Obama were matched by a very real attack on his political base-in 2011 and 2012, 19 states enacted voting restrictions that made it harder for African Americans to vote.\n\nYet in 2012, as in 2008, Obama won anyway. Prior to the election, Obama, ever the optimist, had claimed that intransigent Republicans would decide to work with him to advance the country. No such collaboration was in the offing. Instead, legislation ground to a halt and familiar themes resurfaced. An Idaho GOP official posted a photo on Facebook depicting a trap waiting for Obama. The bait was a slice of watermelon. The caption read, \"Breaking: The secret service just uncovered a plot to kidnap the president. More details as we get them ...\" In 2014, conservatives assembled in support of Cliven Bundy's armed protest against federal grazing fees. As reporters descended on the Bundy ranch in Nevada, Bundy offered his opinions on \"the Negro.\" \"They abort their young children, they put their young men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton,\" Bundy explained. \"And I've often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy? They didn't get no more freedom. They got less freedom.\"\n\nThat same year, in the wake of Michael Brown's death, the Justice Department opened an investigation into the police department in Ferguson, Missouri. It found a city that, through racial profiling, arbitrary fines, and wanton harassment, had exploited law enforcement for the purposes of municipal plunder. The plunder was sanctified by racist humor dispensed via internal emails among the police that later came to light. The president of the United States, who during his first year in office had reportedly received three times the number of death threats of any of his predecessors, was a repeat target.\n\nMuch ink has been spilled in an attempt to understand the Tea Party protests, and the 2016 presidential candidacy of Donald Trump, which ultimately emerged out of them. One theory popular among (primarily) white intellectuals of varying political persuasions held that this response was largely the discontented rumblings of a white working class threatened by the menace of globalization and crony capitalism. Dismissing these rumblings as racism was said to condescend to this proletariat, which had long suffered the slings and arrows of coastal elites, heartless technocrats, and reformist snobs. Racism was not something to be coolly and empirically assessed but a slander upon the working man. Deindustrialization, globalization, and broad income inequality are real. And they have landed with at least as great a force upon black and Latino people in our country as upon white people. And yet these groups were strangely unrepresented in this new populism.\n\nChristopher S. Parker and Matt A. Barreto, political scientists at the University of Washington and UCLA, respectively, have found a relatively strong relationship between racism and Tea Party membership. \"Whites are less likely to be drawn to the Tea Party for material reasons, suggesting that, relative to other groups, it's really more about social prestige,\" they say. The notion that the Tea Party represented the righteous, if unfocused, anger of an aggrieved class allowed everyone from leftists to neoliberals to white nationalists to avoid a horrifying and simple reality: A significant swath of this country did not like the fact that their president was black, and that swath was not composed of those most damaged by an unquestioned faith in the markets. Far better to imagine the grievance put upon the president as the ghost of shambling factories and defunct union halls, as opposed to what it really was-a movement inaugurated by ardent and frightened white capitalists, raging from the commodities-trading floor of one of the great financial centers of the world.\n\nThat movement came into full bloom in the summer of 2015, with the candidacy of Donald Trump, a man who'd risen to political prominence by peddling the racist myth that the president was not American. It was birtherism-not trade, not jobs, not isolationism-that launched Trump's foray into electoral politics. Having risen unexpectedly on this basis into the stratosphere of Republican politics, Trump spent the campaign freely and liberally trafficking in misogyny, Islamophobia, and xenophobia. And on November 8, 2016, he won election to the presidency. Historians will spend the next century analyzing how a country with such allegedly grand democratic traditions was, so swiftly and so easily, brought to the brink of fascism. But one needn't stretch too far to conclude that an eight-year campaign of consistent and open racism aimed at the leader of the free world helped clear the way.\n\n\"They rode the tiger. And now the tiger is eating them,\" David Axelrod, speaking of the Republican Party, told me. That was in October. His words proved too optimistic. The tiger would devour us all.\n\nOne Saturday morning last May, I joined the presidential motorcade as it slipped out of the southern gate of the White House. A mostly white crowd had assembled. As the motorcade drove by, people cheered, held up their smartphones to record the procession, and waved American flags. To be within feet of the president seemed like the thrill of their lives. I was astounded. An old euphoria, which I could not immediately place, gathered up in me. And then I remembered, it was what I felt through much of 2008, as I watched Barack Obama's star shoot across the political sky. I had never seen so many white people cheer on a black man who was neither an athlete nor an entertainer. And it seemed that they loved him for this, and I thought in those days, which now feel so long ago, that they might then love me, too, and love my wife, and love my child, and love us all in the manner that the God they so fervently cited had commanded. I had been raised amid a people who wanted badly to believe in the possibility of a Barack Obama, even as their very lives argued against that possibility. So they would praise Martin Luther King Jr. in one breath and curse the white man, \"the Great Deceiver,\" in the next. Then came Obama and the Obama family, and they were black and beautiful in all the ways we aspired to be, and all that love was showered upon them. But as Obama's motorcade approached its destination-Howard University, where he would give the commencement address-the complexion of the crowd darkened, and I understood that the love was specific, that even if it allowed Barack Obama, even if it allowed the luckiest of us, to defy the boundaries, then the masses of us, in cities like this one, would still enjoy no such feat.\n\nThese were our fitful, spasmodic years.\n\nWe were launched into the Obama era with no notion of what to expect, if only because a black presidency had seemed such a dubious proposition. There was no preparation, because it would have meant preparing for the impossible. There were few assessments of its potential import, because such assessments were regarded as speculative fiction. In retrospect it all makes sense, and one can see a jagged but real political lineage running through black Chicago. It originates in Oscar Stanton De Priest; continues through Congressman William Dawson, who, under Roosevelt, switched from the Republican to the Democratic Party; crescendos with the legendary Harold Washington; rises still with Jesse Jackson's 1988 victory in Michigan's Democratic caucuses; rises again with Carol Moseley Braun's triumph; and reaches its recent apex with the election of Barack Obama. If the lineage is apparent in hindsight, so are the limits of presidential power. For a century after emancipation, quasi-slavery haunted the South. And more than half a century after Brown v. Board of Education , schools throughout much of this country remain segregated.\n\nThere are no clean victories for black people, nor, perhaps, for any people. The presidency of Barack Obama is no different. One can now say that an African American individual can rise to the same level as a white individual, and yet also say that the number of black individuals who actually qualify for that status will be small. One thinks of Serena Williams, whose dominance and stunning achievements can't, in and of themselves, ensure equal access to tennis facilities for young black girls. The gate is open and yet so very far away.\n\nI felt a mix of pride and amazement walking onto Howard's campus that day. Howard alumni, of which I am one, are an obnoxious fraternity, known for yelling the school chant across city blocks, sneering at other historically black colleges and universities, and condescending to black graduates of predominantly white institutions. I like to think I am more reserved, but I felt an immense satisfaction in being in the library where I had once found my history, and now found myself with the first black president of the United States. It seemed providential that he would give the commencement address here in his last year. The same pride I felt radiated out across the Yard, the large green patch in the main area of the campus where the ceremony would take place. When Obama walked out, the audience exploded, and when the time came for the color guard to present arms, a chant arose: \"O-Ba-Ma! O-Ba-Ma! O-Ba-Ma!\"\n\nHe gave a good speech that day, paying heed to Howard's rituals, calling out its famous alumni, shouting out the university's various dormitories, and urging young people to vote. (His usual riff on respectability politics was missing.) But I think he could have stood before that crowd, smiled, and said \"Good luck,\" and they would have loved him anyway. He was their champion, and this was evident in the smallest of things. The national anthem was played first, but then came the black national anthem, \"Lift Every Voice and Sing.\" As the lyrics rang out over the crowd, the students held up the black-power fist-a symbol of defiance before power. And yet here, in the face of a black man in his last year in power, it scanned not as a protest, but as a salute.\n\nSix months later the awful price of a black presidency would be known to those students, even as the country seemed determined not to acknowledge it. In the days after Donald Trump's victory, there would be an insistence that something as \"simple\" as racism could not explain it. As if enslavement had nothing to do with global economics, or as if lynchings said nothing about the idea of women as property. As though the past 400 years could be reduced to the irrational resentment of full lips. No. Racism is never simple. And there was nothing simple about what was coming, or about Obama, the man who had unwittingly summoned this future into being.\n\nIt was said that the Americans who'd supported Trump were victims of liberal condescension. The word racist would be dismissed as a profane slur put upon the common man, as opposed to an accurate description of actual men. \"We simply don't yet know how much racism or misogyny motivated Trump voters,\" David Brooks would write in The New York Times . \"If you were stuck in a jobless town, watching your friends OD on opiates, scrambling every month to pay the electric bill, and then along came a guy who seemed able to fix your problems and hear your voice, maybe you would stomach some ugliness, too.\" This strikes me as perfectly logical. Indeed, it could apply just as well to Louis Farrakhan's appeal to the black poor and working class. But whereas the followers of an Islamophobic white nationalist enjoy the sympathy that must always greet the salt of the earth, the followers of an anti-Semitic black nationalist endure the scorn that must ever greet the children of the enslaved.\n\nMuch would be made of blue-collar voters in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan who'd pulled the lever for Obama in 2008 and 2012 and then for Trump in 2016. Surely these voters disproved racism as an explanatory force. It's still not clear how many individual voters actually flipped. But the underlying presumption-that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama could be swapped in for each other-exhibited a problem. Clinton was a candidate who'd won one competitive political race in her life, whose political instincts were questioned by her own advisers, who took more than half a million dollars in speaking fees from an investment bank because it was \"what they offered,\" who proposed to bring back to the White House a former president dogged by allegations of rape and sexual harassment. Obama was a candidate who'd become only the third black senator in the modern era; who'd twice been elected president, each time flipping red and purple states; who'd run one of the most scandal-free administrations in recent memory. Imagine an African American facsimile of Hillary Clinton: She would never be the nominee of a major political party and likely would not be in national politics at all.\n\nPointing to citizens who voted for both Obama and Trump does not disprove racism; it evinces it. To secure the White House, Obama needed to be a Harvard-trained lawyer with a decade of political experience and an incredible gift for speaking to cross sections of the country; Donald Trump needed only money and white bluster.\n\nIn the week after the election, I was a mess. I had not seen my wife in two weeks. I was on deadline for this article. My son was struggling in school. The house was in disarray. I played Marvin Gaye endlessly-\"When you left, you took all of me with you.\" Friends began to darkly recall the ghosts of post-Reconstruction. The election of Donald Trump confirmed everything I knew of my country and none of what I could accept. The idea that America would follow its first black president with Donald Trump accorded with its history. I was shocked at my own shock. I had wanted Obama to be right.\n\nI still want Obama to be right. I still would like to fold myself into the dream. This will not be possible.\n\nBy some cosmic coincidence, a week after the election I received a portion of my father's FBI file I was made aware of the FBI file by the diligent work of researchers from the show Finding Your Roots . I was taping an episode on my family the day of my last interview with the president. . My father had grown up poor in Philadelphia. His father was struck dead on the street. His grandfather was crushed to death in a meatpacking plant. He'd served his country in Vietnam, gotten radicalized there, and joined the Black Panther Party, which brought him to the attention of J. Edgar Hoover. A memo written to the FBI director was \"submitted aimed at discrediting WILLIAM PAUL COATES, Acting Captain of the BPP, Baltimore.\" The memo proposed that a fake letter be sent to the Panthers' co-founder Huey P. Newton. The fake letter accused my father of being an informant and concluded, \"I want somethin done with this bootlikin facist pig nigger and I want it done now.\" The words somethin done need little interpretation. The Panthers were eventually consumed by an internecine war instigated by the FBI, one in which being labeled a police informant was a death sentence.\n\nA few hours after I saw this file, I had my last conversation with the president. I asked him how his optimism was holding up, given Trump's victory. He confessed to being surprised at the outcome but said that it was tough to \"draw a grand theory from it, because there were some very unusual circumstances.\" He pointed to both candidates' high negatives, the media coverage, and a \"dispirited\" electorate. But he said that his general optimism about the shape of American history remained unchanged. \"To be optimistic about the long-term trends of the United States doesn't mean that everything is going to go in a smooth, direct, straight line,\" he said. \"It goes forward sometimes, sometimes it goes back, sometimes it goes sideways, sometimes it zigs and zags.\"\n\nI thought of Hoover's FBI, which harassed three generations of black activists, from Marcus Garvey's black nationalists to Martin Luther King Jr.'s integrationists to Huey Newton's Black Panthers, including my father. And I thought of the enormous power accrued to the presidency in the post-9/11 era-the power to obtain American citizens' phone records en masse, to access their emails, to detain them indefinitely. I asked the president whether it was all worth it. Whether this generation of black activists and their allies should be afraid.\n\n\"Keep in mind that the capacity of the NSA, or other surveillance tools, are specifically prohibited from being applied to U.S. citizens or U.S. persons without specific evidence of links to terrorist activity or, you know, other foreign-related activity,\" he said. \"So, you know, I think this whole story line that somehow Big Brother has massively expanded and now that a new president is in place it's this loaded gun ready to be used on domestic dissent is just not accurate.\"\n\nHe counseled vigilance, \"because the possibility of abuse by government officials always exists. The issue is not going to be that there are new tools available; the issue is making sure that the incoming administration, like my administration, takes the constraints on how we deal with U.S. citizens and persons seriously.\" This answer did not fill me with confidence. The next day, President-Elect Trump offered Lieutenant General Michael Flynn the post of national-security adviser and picked Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama as his nominee for attorney general. Last February, Flynn tweeted, \"Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL\" and linked to a YouTube video that declared followers of Islam want \"80 percent of humanity enslaved or exterminated.\" Sessions had once been accused of calling a black lawyer \"boy,\" claiming that a white lawyer who represented black clients was a disgrace to his race, and joking that he thought the Ku Klux Klan \"was okay until I found out they smoked pot.\" I felt then that I knew what was coming-more Freddie Grays, more Rekia Boyds, more informants and undercover officers sent to infiltrate mosques.\n\nAnd I also knew that the man who could not countenance such a thing in his America had been responsible for the only time in my life when I felt, as the first lady had once said, proud of my country, and I knew that it was his very lack of countenance, his incredible faith, his improbable trust in his countrymen, that had made that feeling possible. The feeling was that little black boy touching the president's hair. It was watching Obama on the campaign trail, always expecting the worst and amazed that the worst never happened. It was how I'd felt seeing Barack and Michelle during the inauguration, the car slow-dragging down Pennsylvania Avenue, the crowd cheering, and then the two of them rising up out of the limo, rising up from fear, smiling, waving, defying despair, defying history, defying gravity.\n\nTheAtlantic.com Copyright (c) 2025 by The Atlantic Monthly Group.

      "text": "My President Was Black\n\nA history of the first African American White House-and of what came next\n\n\"They're a rotten crowd,\" I shouted across the lawn. \"You're worth the whole damn bunch put together.\"\n\n- F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby\n\nIn the waning days of President Barack Obama's administration, he and his wife, Michelle, hosted a farewell party, the full import of which no one could then grasp. It was late October, Friday the 21st, and the president had spent many of the previous weeks, as he would spend the two subsequent weeks, campaigning for the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. Things were looking up. Polls in the crucial states of Virginia and Pennsylvania showed Clinton with solid advantages. The formidable GOP strongholds of Georgia and Texas were said to be under threat. The moment seemed to buoy Obama. He had been light on his feet in these last few weeks, cracking jokes at the expense of Republican opponents and laughing off hecklers. At a rally in Orlando on October 28, he greeted a student who would be introducing him by dancing toward her and then noting that the song playing over the loudspeakers-the Gap Band's \"Outstanding\"-was older than she was. \"This is classic!\" he said. Then he flashed the smile that had launched America's first black presidency, and started dancing again. Three months still remained before Inauguration Day, but staffers had already begun to count down the days. They did this with a mix of pride and longing-like college seniors in early May. They had no sense of the world they were graduating into. None of us did.\n\nThe farewell party, presented by BET (Black Entertainment Television), was the last in a series of concerts the first couple had hosted at the White House. Guests were asked to arrive at 5:30 p.m. By 6, two long lines stretched behind the Treasury Building, where the Secret Service was checking names. The people in these lines were, in the main, black, and their humor reflected it. The brisker queue was dubbed the \"good-hair line\" by one guest, and there was laughter at the prospect of the Secret Service subjecting us all to a \"brown-paper-bag test.\" This did not come to pass, but security was tight. Several guests were told to stand in a makeshift pen and wait to have their backgrounds checked a second time.\n\nListen to the audio version of this article: Download the Audm app for your iPhone to listen to more titles.\n\nDave Chappelle was there. He coolly explained the peril and promise of comedy in what was then still only a remotely potential Donald Trump presidency: \"I mean, we never had a guy have his own pussygate scandal.\" Everyone laughed. A few weeks later, he would be roundly criticized for telling a crowd at the Cutting Room, in New York, that he had voted for Clinton but did not feel good about it. \"She's going to be on a coin someday,\" Chappelle said. \"And her behavior has not been coinworthy.\" But on this crisp October night, everything felt inevitable and grand. There was a slight wind. It had been in the 80s for much of that week. Now, as the sun set, the season remembered its name. Women shivered in their cocktail dresses. Gentlemen chivalrously handed over their suit coats. But when Naomi Campbell strolled past the security pen in a sleeveless number, she seemed as invulnerable as ever.\n\nCellphones were confiscated to prevent surreptitious recordings from leaking out. (This effort was unsuccessful. The next day, a partygoer would tweet a video of the leader of the free world dancing to Drake's \"Hotline Bling.\") After withstanding the barrage of security, guests were welcomed into the East Wing of the White House, and then ushered back out into the night, where they boarded a succession of orange-and-green trolleys. The singer and actress Janelle Monáe, her famous and fantastic pompadour preceding her, stepped on board and joked with a companion about the historical import of \"sitting in the back of the bus.\" She took a seat three rows from the front and hummed into the night. The trolley dropped the guests on the South Lawn, in front of a giant tent. The South Lawn's fountain was lit up with blue lights. The White House proper loomed like a ghost in the distance. I heard the band, inside, beginning to play Al Green's \"Let's Stay Together.\"\n\n\"Well, you can tell what type of night this is,\" Obama said from the stage, opening the event. \"Not the usual ruffles and flourishes!\"\n\nThe crowd roared.\n\n\"This must be a BET event!\"\n\nThe crowd roared louder still.\n\nObama placed the concert in the White House's musical tradition, noting that guests of the Kennedys had once done the twist at the residence-\"the twerking of their time,\" he said, before adding, \"There will be no twerking tonight. At least not by me.\"\n\nThe Obamas are fervent and eclectic music fans. In the past eight years, they have hosted performances at the White House by everyone from Mavis Staples to Bob Dylan to Tony Bennett to the Blind Boys of Alabama. After the rapper Common was invited to perform in 2011, a small fracas ensued in the right-wing media. He performed anyway-and was invited back again this glorious fall evening and almost stole the show. The crowd sang along to the hook for his hit ballad \"The Light.\" And when he brought on the gospel singer Yolanda Adams to fill in for John Legend on the Oscar-winning song \"Glory,\" glee turned to rapture.\n\nDe La Soul was there. The hip-hop trio had come of age as boyish B-boys with Gumby-style high-top fades. Now they moved across the stage with a lovely mix of lethargy and grace, like your favorite uncle making his way down the Soul Train line, wary of throwing out a hip. I felt a sense of victory watching them rock the crowd, all while keeping it in the pocket. The victory belonged to hip-hop-an art form birthed in the burning Bronx and now standing full grown, at the White House, unbroken and unedited. Usher led the crowd in a call-and-response: \"Say it loud, I'm black and I'm proud.\" Jill Scott showed off her operatic chops. Bell Biv DeVoe, contemporaries of De La, made history with their performance by surely becoming the first group to suggest to a presidential audience that one should \"never trust a big butt and a smile.\"\n\nThe ties between the Obama White House and the hip-hop community are genuine. The Obamas are social with Beyoncé and Jay-Z. They hosted Chance the Rapper and Frank Ocean at a state dinner, and last year invited Swizz Beatz, Busta Rhymes, and Ludacris, among others, to discuss criminal-justice reform and other initiatives. Obama once stood in the Rose Garden passing large flash cards to the Hamilton creator and rapper Lin-Manuel Miranda, who then freestyled using each word on the cards. \"Drop the beat,\" Obama said, inaugurating the session. At 55, Obama is younger than pioneering hip-hop artists like Afrika Bambaataa, DJ Kool Herc, and Kurtis Blow. If Obama's enormous symbolic power draws primarily from being the country's first black president, it also draws from his membership in hip-hop's foundational generation.\n\nThat night, the men were sharp in their gray or black suits and optional ties. Those who were not in suits had chosen to make a statement, like the dark-skinned young man who strolled in, sockless, with blue jeans cuffed so as to accentuate his gorgeous black-suede loafers. Everything in his ensemble seemed to say, \"My fellow Americans, do not try this at home.\" There were women in fur jackets and high heels; others with sculpted naturals, the sides shaved close, the tops blooming into curls; others still in gold bamboo earrings and long blond dreads. When the actor Jesse Williams took the stage, seemingly awed before such black excellence, before such black opulence, assembled just feet from where slaves had once toiled, he simply said, \"Look where we are. Look where we are right now.\"\n\nThis would not happen again, and everyone knew it. It was not just that there might never be another African American president of the United States. It was the feeling that this particular black family, the Obamas, represented the best of black people, the ultimate credit to the race, incomparable in elegance and bearing. \"There are no more,\" the comedian Sinbad joked back in 2010. \"There are no black men raised in Kansas and Hawaii. That's the last one. Y'all better treat this one right. The next one gonna be from Cleveland. He gonna wear a perm. Then you gonna see what it's really like.\" Throughout their residency, the Obamas had refrained from showing America \"what it's really like,\" and had instead followed the first lady's motto, \"When they go low, we go high.\" This was the ideal-black and graceful under fire-saluted that evening. The president was lionized as \"our crown jewel.\" The first lady was praised as the woman \"who put the O in Obama .\"\n\nBarack Obama's victories in 2008 and 2012 were dismissed by some of his critics as merely symbolic for African Americans. But there is nothing \"mere\" about symbols. The power embedded in the word nigger is also symbolic. Burning crosses do not literally raise the black poverty rate, and the Confederate flag does not directly expand the wealth gap.\n\nMuch as the unbroken ranks of 43 white male presidents communicated that the highest office of government in the country-indeed, the most powerful political offices in the world-was off-limits to black individuals, the election of Barack Obama communicated that the prohibition had been lifted. It communicated much more. Before Obama triumphed in 2008, the most-famous depictions of black success tended to be entertainers or athletes. But Obama had shown that it was \"possible to be smart and cool at the same damn time,\" as Jesse Williams put it at the BET party. Moreover, he had not embarrassed his people with a string of scandals. Against the specter of black pathology, against the narrow images of welfare moms and deadbeat dads, his time in the White House had been an eight-year showcase of a healthy and successful black family spanning three generations, with two dogs to boot. In short, he became a symbol of black people's everyday, extraordinary Americanness.\n\nWhiteness in America is a different symbol-a badge of advantage. In a country of professed meritocratic competition, this badge has long ensured an unerring privilege, represented in a 220-year monopoly on the highest office in the land. For some not-insubstantial sector of the country, the elevation of Barack Obama communicated that the power of the badge had diminished. For eight long years, the badge-holders watched him. They saw footage of the president throwing bounce passes and shooting jumpers. They saw him enter a locker room, give a businesslike handshake to a white staffer, and then greet Kevin Durant with something more soulful. They saw his wife dancing with Jimmy Fallon and posing, resplendent, on the covers of magazines that had, only a decade earlier, been almost exclusively, if unofficially, reserved for ladies imbued with the great power of the badge.\n\nFor the preservation of the badge, insidious rumors were concocted to denigrate the first black White House. Obama gave free cellphones to disheveled welfare recipients. Obama went to Europe and complained that \"ordinary men and women are too small-minded to govern their own affairs.\" Obama had inscribed an Arabic saying on his wedding ring, then stopped wearing the ring, in observance of Ramadan. He canceled the National Day of Prayer; refused to sign certificates for Eagle Scouts; faked his attendance at Columbia University; and used a teleprompter to address a group of elementary-school students. The badge-holders fumed. They wanted their country back. And, though no one at the farewell party knew it, in a couple of weeks they would have it.\n\nOn this October night, though, the stage belonged to another America. At the end of the party, Obama looked out into the crowd, searching for Dave Chappelle. \"Where's Dave?\" he cried. And then, finding him, the president referenced Chappelle's legendary Brooklyn concert. \"You got your block party. I got my block party.\" Then the band struck up Al Green's \"Love and Happiness\"-the evening's theme. The president danced in a line next to Ronnie DeVoe. Together they mouthed the lyrics: \"Make you do right. Love will make you do wrong.\"\n\nLast spring , I went to the White House to meet the president for lunch. I arrived slightly early and sat in the waiting area. I was introduced to a deaf woman who worked as the president's receptionist, a black woman who worked in the press office, a Muslim woman in a head scarf who worked on the National Security Council, and an Iranian American woman who worked as a personal aide to the president. This receiving party represented a healthy cross section of the people Donald Trump had been mocking, and would continue to spend his campaign mocking. At the time, the president seemed untroubled by Trump. When I told Obama that I thought Trump's candidacy was an explicit reaction to the fact of a black president, he said he could see that, but then enumerated other explanations. When assessing Trump's chances, he was direct: He couldn't win.\n\nSubscribe to The Atlantic and support 160 years of independent journalism\n\nThis assessment was born out of the president's innate optimism and unwavering faith in the ultimate wisdom of the American people-the same traits that had propelled his unlikely five-year ascent from assemblyman in the Illinois state legislature to U.S. senator to leader of the free world. The speech that launched his rise, the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, emerged right from this logic. He addressed himself to his \"fellow Americans, Democrats, Republicans, independents,\" all of whom, he insisted, were more united than they had been led to believe. America was home to devout worshippers and Little League coaches in blue states, civil libertarians and \"gay friends\" in red states. The presumably white \"counties around Chicago\" did not want their taxes burned on welfare, but they didn't want them wasted on a bloated Pentagon budget either. Inner-city black families, no matter their perils, understood \"that government alone can't teach our kids to learn ... that children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white.\"\n\nPerceived differences were the work of \"spinmasters and negative-ad peddlers who embrace the politics of 'anything goes.' \" Real America had no use for such categorizations. By Obama's lights, there was no liberal America, no conservative America, no black America, no white America, no Latino America, no Asian America, only \"the United States of America.\" All these disparate strands of the American experience were bound together by a common hope:\n\nThis speech ran counter to the history of the people it sought to address. Some of those same immigrants had firebombed the homes of the children of those same slaves. That young naval lieutenant was an imperial agent for a failed, immoral war. American division was real. In 2004, John Kerry did not win a single southern state. But Obama appealed to a belief in innocence-in particular a white innocence-that ascribed the country's historical errors more to misunderstanding and the work of a small cabal than to any deliberate malevolence or widespread racism. America was good. America was great.\n\nOver the next 12 years, I came to regard Obama as a skilled politician, a deeply moral human being, and one of the greatest presidents in American history. He was phenomenal-the most agile interpreter and navigator of the color line I had ever seen. He had an ability to emote a deep and sincere connection to the hearts of black people, while never doubting the hearts of white people. This was the core of his 2004 keynote, and it marked his historic race speech during the 2008 campaign at Philadelphia's National Constitution Center-and blinded him to the appeal of Trump. (\"As a general proposition, it's hard to run for president by telling people how terrible things are,\" Obama once said to me.)\n\nBut if the president's inability to cement his legacy in the form of Hillary Clinton proved the limits of his optimism, it also revealed the exceptional nature of his presidential victories. For eight years Barack Obama walked on ice and never fell. Nothing in that time suggested that straight talk on the facts of racism in American life would have given him surer footing.\n\nI had met the president a few times before. In his second term, I'd written articles criticizing him for his overriding trust in color-blind policy and his embrace of \"personal responsibility\" rhetoric when speaking to African Americans. I saw him as playing both sides. He would invoke his identity as a president of all people to decline to advocate for black policy-and then invoke his black identity to lecture black people for continuing to \"make bad choices.\" In response, Obama had invited me, along with other journalists, to the White House for off-the-record conversations. I attempted to press my points in these sessions. My efforts were laughable and ineffective. I was always inappropriately dressed, and inappropriately calibrated in tone: In one instance, I was too deferential; in another, too bellicose. I was discombobulated by fear-not by fear of the power of his office (though that is a fearsome and impressive thing) but by fear of his obvious brilliance. It is said that Obama speaks \"professorially,\" a fact that understates the quickness and agility of his mind. These were not like press conferences-the president would speak in depth and with great familiarity about a range of subjects. Once, I watched him effortlessly reply to queries covering everything from electoral politics to the American economy to environmental policy. And then he turned to me. I thought of George Foreman, who once booked an exhibition with multiple opponents in which he pounded five straight journeymen-and I suddenly had some idea of how it felt to be the last of them.\n\nLast spring, we had a light lunch. We talked casually and candidly. He talked about the brilliance of LeBron James and Stephen Curry-not as basketball talents but as grounded individuals. I asked him whether he was angry at his father, who had abandoned him at a young age to move back to Kenya, and whether that motivated any of his rhetoric. He said it did not, and he credited the attitude of his mother and grandparents for this. Then it was my turn to be autobiographical. I told him that I had heard the kind of \"straighten up\" talk he had been giving to black youth, for instance in his 2013 Morehouse commencement address, all my life. I told him that I thought it was not sensitive to the inner turmoil that can be obscured by the hardness kids often evince. I told him I thought this because I had once been one of those kids. He seemed to concede this point, but I couldn't tell whether it mattered to him. Nonetheless, he agreed to a series of more formal conversations on this and other topics.\n\nThe improbability of a black president had once been so strong that its most vivid representations were comedic. Witness Dave Chappelle's profane Black Bush from the early 2000s (\"This nigger very possibly has weapons of mass destruction! I can't sleep on that!\") or Richard Pryor's black president in the 1970s promising black astronauts and black quarterbacks (\"Ever since the Rams got rid of James Harris, my jaw's been uptight!\"). In this model, so potent is the force of blackness that the presidency is forced to conform to it. But once the notion advanced out of comedy and into reality, the opposite proved to be true.\n\nObama's DNC speech is the key. It does not belong to the literature of \"the struggle\"; it belongs to the literature of prospective presidents-men (as it turns out) who speak not to gravity and reality, but to aspirations and dreams. When Lincoln invoked the dream of a nation \"conceived in liberty\" and pledged to the ideal that \"all men are created equal,\" he erased the near-extermination of one people and the enslavement of another. When Roosevelt told the country that \"the only thing we have to fear is fear itself,\" he invoked the dream of American omnipotence and boundless capability. But black people, then living under a campaign of terror for more than half a century, had quite a bit to fear, and Roosevelt could not save them. The dream Ronald Reagan invoked in 1984-that \"it's morning again in America\"-meant nothing to the inner cities, besieged as they were by decades of redlining policies, not to mention crack and Saturday-night specials. Likewise, Obama's keynote address conflated the slave and the nation of immigrants who profited from him. To reinforce the majoritarian dream, the nightmare endured by the minority is erased. That is the tradition to which the \"skinny kid with a funny name\" who would be president belonged. It is also the only tradition in existence that could have possibly put a black person in the White House.\n\nObama's embrace of white innocence was demonstrably necessary as a matter of political survival. Whenever he attempted to buck this directive, he was disciplined. His mild objection to the arrest of Henry Louis Gates Jr. in 2009 contributed to his declining favorability numbers among whites-still a majority of voters. His comments after the killing of Trayvon Martin-\"If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon\"-helped make that tragedy a rallying point for people who did not care about Martin's killer as much as they cared about finding ways to oppose the president. Michael Tesler, a political-science professor at UC Irvine, has studied the effect of Obama's race on the American electorate. \"No other factor, in fact, came close to dividing the Democratic primary electorate as powerfully as their feelings about African Americans,\" he and his co-author, David O. Sears, concluded in their book, Obama's Race: The 2008 Election and the Dream of a Post-Racial America . \"The impact of racial attitudes on individual vote decisions ... was so strong that it appears to have even outstripped the substantive impact of racial attitudes on Jesse Jackson's more racially charged campaign for the nomination in 1988.\" When Tesler looked at the 2012 campaign in his second book, Post-Racial or Most-Racial? Race and Politics in the Obama Era , very little had improved. Analyzing the extent to which racial attitudes affected people associated with Obama during the 2012 election, Tesler concluded that \"racial attitudes spilled over from Barack Obama into mass assessments of Mitt Romney, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Charlie Crist, and even the Obama family's dog Bo.\"\n\nYet despite this entrenched racial resentment, and in the face of complete resistance by congressional Republicans, overtly launched from the moment Obama arrived in the White House, the president accomplished major feats. He remade the nation's health-care system. He revitalized a Justice Department that vigorously investigated police brutality and discrimination, and he began dismantling the private-prison system for federal inmates. Obama nominated the first Latina justice to the Supreme Court, gave presidential support to marriage equality, and ended the U.S. military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, thus honoring the civil-rights tradition that had inspired him. And if his very existence inflamed America's racist conscience, it also expanded the country's anti-racist imagination. Millions of young people now know their only president to have been an African American. Writing for The New Yorker , Jelani Cobb once noted that \"until there was a black Presidency it was impossible to conceive of the limitations of one.\" This is just as true of the possibilities. In 2014, the Obama administration committed itself to reversing the War on Drugs through the power of presidential commutation. The administration said that it could commute the sentences of as many as 10,000 prisoners. As of November, the president had commuted only 944 sentences. By any measure, Obama's effort fell woefully short, except for this small one: the measure of almost every other modern president who preceded him. Obama's 944 commutations are the most in nearly a century-and more than the past 11 presidents' combined.\n\nObama was born into a country where laws barring his very conception-let alone his ascendancy to the presidency-had long stood in force. A black president would always be a contradiction for a government that, throughout most of its history, had oppressed black people. The attempt to resolve this contradiction through Obama-a black man with deep roots in the white world-was remarkable. The price it exacted, incredible. The world it gave way to, unthinkable.\n\nWhen Barack Obama was 10, his father gave him a basketball, a gift that connected the two directly. Obama was born in 1961 in Hawaii and raised by his mother, Ann Dunham, who was white, and her parents, Stanley and Madelyn. They loved him ferociously, supported him emotionally, and encouraged him intellectually. They also told him he was black. Ann gave him books to read about famous black people. When Obama's mother had begun dating his father, the news had not been greeted with the threat of lynching (as it might have been in various parts of the continental United States), and Obama's grandparents always spoke positively of his father. This biography makes Obama nearly unique among black people of his era.\n\nIn the president's memoir, Dreams From My Father , he says he was not an especially talented basketball player, but he played with a consuming passion. That passion was directed at something more than just the mastering of the pick-and-roll or the perfecting of his jump shot. Obama came of age during the time of the University of Hawaii basketball team's \"Fabulous Five\"-a name given to its all-black starting five, two decades before it would be resurrected at the University of Michigan by the likes of Chris Webber and Jalen Rose. In his memoir, Obama writes that he would watch the University of Hawaii players laughing at \"some inside joke,\" winking \"at the girls on the sidelines,\" or \"casually flipping lay-ups.\" What Obama saw in the Fabulous Five was not just game, but a culture he found attractive:\n\nThese are lessons, particularly the last one, that for black people apply as much on the street as they do on the court. Basketball was a link for Obama, a medium for downloading black culture from the mainland that birthed the Fabulous Five. Assessing his own thought process at the time, Obama writes, \"I decided to become part of that world.\" This is one of the most incredible sentences ever written in the long, decorated history of black memoir, if only because very few black people have ever enjoyed enough power to write it.\n\nHistorically, in black autobiography, to be remanded into the black race has meant exposure to a myriad of traumas, often commencing in childhood. Frederick Douglass is separated from his grandmother. The enslaved Harriet Ann Jacobs must constantly cope with the threat of rape before she escapes. After telling his teacher he wants to be a lawyer, Malcolm X is told that the job isn't for \"niggers.\" Black culture often serves as the balm for such traumas, or even the means to resist them. Douglass finds the courage to face the \"slave-breaker\" Edward Covey after being given an allegedly enchanted root by \"a genuine African\" possessing powers from \"the eastern nations.\" Malcolm X's dancing connects him to his \"long-suppressed African instincts.\" If black racial identity speaks to all the things done to people of recent African ancestry, black cultural identity was created in response to them. The division is not neat; the two are linked, and it is incredibly hard to be a full participant in the world of cultural identity without experiencing the trauma of racial identity.\n\nObama is somewhat different. He writes of bloodying the nose of a white kid who called him a \"coon,\" and of chafing at racist remarks from a tennis coach, and of feeling offended after a white woman in his apartment building told the manager that he was following her. But the kinds of traumas that marked African Americans of his generation-beatings at the hands of racist police, being herded into poor schools, grinding out a life in a tenement building-were mostly abstract for him. Moreover, the kind of spatial restriction that most black people feel at an early age-having rocks thrown at you for being on the wrong side of the tracks, for instance-was largely absent from his life. In its place, Obama was gifted with a well-stamped passport and admittance to elite private schools-all of which spoke of other identities, other lives and other worlds where the color line was neither determinative nor especially relevant. Obama could have grown into a raceless cosmopolitan. Surely he would have lived in a world of problems, but problems not embodied by him.\n\nInstead, he decided to enter this world.\n\n\"I always felt as if being black was cool,\" Obama told me while traveling to a campaign event. He was sitting on Air Force One , his tie loosened, his shirtsleeves rolled up. \"[Being black] was not something to run away from but something to embrace. Why that is, I think, is complicated. Part of it is I think that my mother thought black folks were cool, and if your mother loves you and is praising you-and says you look good, are smart-as you are, then you don't kind of think in terms of How can I avoid this? You feel pretty good about it.\"\n\nAs a child, Obama's embrace of blackness was facilitated, not impeded, by white people. Obama's mother pointed him toward the history and culture of African Americans. Stanley, his grandfather, who came originally from Kansas, took him to basketball games at the University of Hawaii, as well as to black bars. Stanley introduced him to the black writer Frank Marshall Davis. The facilitation was as much indirect as direct. Obama recalls watching his grandfather at those black bars and understanding that \"most of the people in the bar weren't there out of choice,\" and that \"our presence there felt forced.\" From his mother's life of extensive travel, he learned to value the significance of having a home.\n\nThat suspicion of rootlessness extends throughout Dreams From My Father . He describes integration as a \"one-way street\" on which black people are asked to abandon themselves to fully experience America's benefits. Confronted with a woman named Joyce, a mixed-race, green-eyed college classmate who insists that she is not \"black\" but \"multiracial,\" Obama is scornful. \"That was the problem with people like Joyce,\" he writes. \"They talked about the richness of their multicultural heritage and it sounded real good, until you noticed that they avoided black people.\" Later in the memoir, Obama tells the story of falling in love with a white woman. During a visit to her family's country house, he found himself in the library, which was filled with pictures of the woman's illustrious relations. But instead of being in awe, Obama realized that he and the woman lived in different worlds. \"And I knew that if we stayed together, I'd eventually live in hers,\" he writes. \"Between the two of us, I was the one who knew how to live as an outsider.\"\n\nAfter college, Obama found a home, as well as a sense of himself, working on the South Side of Chicago as a community organizer. \"When I started doing that work, my story merges with a larger story. That happens naturally for a John Lewis,\" he told me, referring to the civil-rights hero and Democratic congressman. \"That happens more naturally for you. It was less obvious to me. How do I pull all these different strains together: Kenya and Hawaii and Kansas, and white and black and Asian-how does that fit? And through action, through work, I suddenly see myself as part of the bigger process for, yes, delivering justice for the [African American community] and specifically the South Side community, the low-income people-justice on behalf of the African American community. But also thereby promoting my ideas of justice and equality and empathy that my mother taught me were universal. So I'm in a position to understand those essential parts of me not as separate and apart from any particular community but connected to every community. And I can fit the African American struggle for freedom and justice in the context of the universal aspiration for freedom and justice.\"\n\nThroughout Obama's 2008 campaign and into his presidency, this attitude proved key to his deep support in the black community. African Americans, weary of high achievers who distanced themselves from their black roots, understood that Obama had paid a price for checking \"black\" on his census form, and for living black, for hosting Common, for brushing dirt off his shoulder during the primaries, for marrying a woman who looked like Michelle Obama. If women, as a gender, must suffer the constant evaluations and denigrations of men, black women must suffer that, plus a broad dismissal from the realm of what American society deems to be beautiful. But Michelle Obama is beautiful in the way that black people know themselves to be. Her prominence as first lady directly attacks a poison that diminishes black girls from the moment they are capable of opening a magazine or turning on a television.\n\nThe South Side of Chicago, where Obama began his political career, is home to arguably the most prominent and storied black political establishment in the country. In addition to Oscar Stanton De Priest, the first African American elected to Congress in the 20th century, the South Side produced the city's first black mayor, Harold Washington; Jesse Jackson, who twice ran for president; and Carol Moseley Braun, the first African American woman to win a Senate race. These victories helped give rise to Obama's own. Harold Washington served as an inspiration to Obama and looms heavily over the Chicago section of Dreams From My Father .\n\nWashington forged the kind of broad coalition that Obama would later assemble nationally. But Washington did this in the mid-1980s in segregated Chicago, and he had not had the luxury, as Obama did, of becoming black with minimal trauma. \"There was an edge to Harold that frightened some white voters,\" David Axelrod, who worked for both Washington and Obama, told me recently. Axelrod recalled sitting around a conference table with Washington after he had won the Democratic primary for his reelection in 1987, just as the mayor was about to hold a press conference. Washington asked what percentage of Chicago's white vote he'd received. \"And someone said, 'Well, you got 21 percent. And that's really good because last time' \"-in his successful 1983 mayoral campaign-\" 'you only got 8,' \" Axelrod recalled. \"And he kind of smiled, sadly, and said, 'You know, I probably spent 70 percent of my time in those white neighborhoods, and I think I've been a good mayor for everybody, and I got 21 percent of the white vote and we think it's good.' And he just kind of shook his head and said, 'Ain't it a bitch to be a black man in the land of the free and the home of the brave?'\n\n\"That was Harold. He felt those things. He had fought in an all-black unit in World War II. He had come up in times-and that and the sort of indignities of what you had to do to come up through the machine really seared him.\" During his 1983 mayoral campaign, Washington was loudly booed outside a church in northwest Chicago by middle-class Poles, Italians, and Irish, who feared blacks would uproot them. \"It was as vicious and ugly as anything you would have seen in the old South,\" Axelrod said.\n\nObama's ties to the South Side tradition that Washington represented were complicated. Like Washington, Obama attempted to forge a coalition between black South Siders and the broader community. But Obama, despite his adherence to black cultural mores, was, with his roots in Kansas and Hawaii, his Ivy League pedigree, and his ties to the University of Chicago, still an exotic out-of-towner. \"They were a bit skeptical of him,\" says Salim Muwakkil, a journalist who has covered Obama since before his days in the Illinois state Senate. \"Chicago is a very insular community, and he came from nowhere, seemingly.\"\n\nObama compounded people's suspicions by refusing to humble himself and go along with the political currents of the South Side. \"A lot of the politicians, especially the black ones, were just leery of him,\" Kaye Wilson, the godmother to Obama's children and one of the president's earliest political supporters, told me recently.\n\nBut even as many in the black political community were skeptical of Obama, others encouraged him-sometimes when they voted against him. When Obama lost the 2000 Democratic-primary race against Bobby Rush, the African American incumbent congressman representing Illinois' First Congressional District, the then-still-obscure future president experienced the defeat as having to do more with his age than his exoticism. \"I'd go meet people and I'd knock on doors and stuff, and some of the grandmothers who were the folks I'd been organizing and working with doing community stuff, they weren't parroting back some notion of 'You're too Harvard,' or 'You're too Hyde Park,' or what have you,\" Obama told me. \"They'd say, 'You're a wonderful young man, you're going to do great things. You just have to be patient.' So I didn't feel the loss as a rejection by black people. I felt the loss as 'politics anywhere is tough.' Politics in Chicago is especially tough. And being able to break through in the African American community is difficult because of the enormous loyalty that people feel towards anybody who has been around awhile.\"\n\nThere was no one around to compete for loyalty when Obama ran for Senate in 2004, or for president in 2008. He was no longer competing against other African Americans; he was representing them. \"He had that hybridity which told the 'do-gooders'-in Chicago they call the reformers the do-gooders-that he was acceptable,\" Muwakkil told me.\n\nObama ran for the Senate two decades after the death of Harold Washington. Axelrod checked in on the precinct where Washington had been so loudly booed by white Chicagoans. \"Obama carried, against seven candidates for the Senate, almost the entire northwest side and that precinct,\" he said. \"And I told him, 'Harold's smiling down on us tonight.' \"\n\nObama believes that his statewide victory for the Illinois Senate seat held particular portent for the events of 2008. \"Illinois is the most demographically representative state in the country,\" he told me. \"If you took all the percentages of black, white, Latino; rural, urban; agricultural, manufacturing-[if] you took that cross section across the country and you shrank it, it would be Illinois.\"\n\nIllinois effectively allowed Obama to play a scrimmage before the big national game in 2008. \"When I ran for the Senate I had to go into southern Illinois, downstate Illinois, farming communities-some with very tough racial histories, some areas where there just were no African Americans of any number,\" Obama told me. \"And when we won that race, not just an African American from Chicago, but an African American with an exotic history and [the] name Barack Hussein Obama, [it showed that I] could connect with and appeal to a much broader audience.\"\n\nThe mix of Obama's \"hybridity\" and the changing times allowed him to extend his appeal beyond the white ethnic corners of Chicago, past the downstate portions of Illinois, and out into the country at large. \"Ben Nelson, one of the most conservative Democrats in the Senate, from Nebraska, would only bring in one national Democrat to campaign for him,\" Obama recalls. \"And it was me. And so part of the reason I was willing to run [for president in 2008] was that I had had two years in which we were generating enormous crowds all across the country-and the majority of those crowds were not African American; and they were in pretty remote places, or unlikely places. They weren't just big cities or they weren't just liberal enclaves. So what that told me was, it was possible.\"\n\nWhat those crowds saw was a black candidate unlike any other before him. To simply point to Obama's white mother, or to his African father, or even to his rearing in Hawaii, is to miss the point. For most African Americans, white people exist either as a direct or an indirect force for bad in their lives. Biraciality is no shield against this; often it just intensifies the problem. What proved key for Barack Obama was not that he was born to a black man and a white woman, but that his white family approved of the union, and approved of the child who came from it. They did this in 1961-a time when sex between black men and white women, in large swaths of the country, was not just illegal but fraught with mortal danger. But that danger is not part of Obama's story. The first white people he ever knew, the ones who raised him, were decent in a way that very few black people of that era experienced.\n\nI asked Obama what he made of his grandparents' impressively civilized reception of his father. \"It wasn't Harry Belafonte,\" Obama said laughingly of his father. \"This was like an African African. And he was like a blue-black brother. Nilotic. And so, yeah, I will always give my grandparents credit for that. I'm not saying they were happy about it. I'm not saying that they were not, after the guy leaves, looking at each other like, 'What the heck?' But whatever misgivings they had, they never expressed to me, never spilled over into how they interacted with me.\n\n\"Now, part of it, as I say in my book, was we were in this unique environment in Hawaii where I think it was much easier. I don't know if it would have been as easy for them if they were living in Chicago at the time, because the lines just weren't as sharply drawn in Hawaii as they were on the mainland.\"\n\nObama's early positive interactions with his white family members gave him a fundamentally different outlook toward the wider world than most blacks of the 1960s had. Obama told me he rarely had \"the working assumption of discrimination, the working assumption that white people would not treat me right or give me an opportunity or judge me [other than] on the basis of merit.\" He continued, \"The kind of working assumption\" that white people would discriminate against him or treat him poorly \"is less embedded in my psyche than it is, say, with Michelle.\"\n\nIn this, the first lady is more representative of black America than her husband is. African Americans typically raise their children to protect themselves against a presumed hostility from white teachers, white police officers, white supervisors, and white co-workers. The need for that defense is, more often than not, reinforced either directly by actual encounters or indirectly by observing the vast differences between one's own experience and those across the color line. Marty Nesbitt, the president's longtime best friend, who, like Obama, had positive interactions with whites at a relatively early age, told me that when he and his wife went to buy their first car, she was insistent on buying from a black salesperson. \"I'm like, 'We've got to find a salesman,' \" Nesbitt said. \"She's like, 'No, no, no. We're waiting for the brother.' And I'm like, 'He's with a customer.' They were filling out documents and she was like, 'We're going to stay around.' And a white guy came up to us. 'Can I help you?' 'Nope.' \" Nesbitt was not out to condemn anyone with this story. He was asserting that \"the willingness of African Americans [in Chicago] to help lift each other up is powerful.\"\n\nBut that willingness to help is also a defense, produced by decades of discrimination. Obama sees race through a different lens, Kaye Wilson told me. \"It's just very different from ours,\" she explained. \"He's got buddies that are white, and they're his buddies, and they love him. And I don't think they love him just because he's the president. They love him because they're his friends from Hawaii, some from college and all.\n\n\"So I think he's got that, whereas I think growing up in the racist United States, we enter this thing with, you know, 'I'm looking at you. I'm not trusting you to be one hundred with me.' And I think he grew up in a way that he had to trust [white people]-how can you live under the roof with people and think that they don't love you? He needs that frame of reference. He needs that lens. If he didn't have it, it would be ... a Jesse Jackson, you know? Or Al Sharpton. Different lens.\"\n\nThat lens, born of literally relating to whites, allowed Obama to imagine that he could be the country's first black president. \"If I walked into a room and it's a bunch of white farmers, trade unionists, middle age-I'm not walking in thinking, Man, I've got to show them that I'm normal ,\" Obama explained. \"I walk in there, I think, with a set of assumptions: like, these people look just like my grandparents. And I see the same Jell‐O mold that my grandmother served, and they've got the same, you know, little stuff on their mantelpieces. And so I am maybe disarming them by just assuming that we're okay.\"\n\nWhat Obama was able to offer white America is something very few African Americans could-trust. The vast majority of us are, necessarily, too crippled by our defenses to ever consider such a proposition. But Obama, through a mixture of ancestral connections and distance from the poisons of Jim Crow, can credibly and sincerely trust the majority population of this country. That trust is reinforced, not contradicted, by his blackness. Obama isn't shuffling before white power (Herman Cain's \"shucky ducky\" act) or flattering white ego (O. J. Simpson's listing not being seen as black as a great accomplishment). That, too, is defensive, and deep down, I suspect, white people know it. He stands firm in his own cultural traditions and says to the country something virtually no black person can, but every president must: \"I believe you.\"\n\nJust after Columbus Day , I accompanied the president and his formidable entourage on a visit to North Carolina A&T State University, in Greensboro. Four days earlier, The Washington Post had published an old audio clip that featured Donald Trump lamenting a failed sexual conquest and exhorting the virtues of sexual assault. The next day, Trump claimed that this was \"locker room\" talk. As we flew to North Carolina, the president was in a state of bemused disbelief. He plopped down in a chair in the staff cabin of Air Force One and said, \"I've been in a lot of locker rooms. I don't think I've ever heard that one before.\" He was casual and relaxed. A feeling of cautious inevitability emanated from his staff, and why not? Every day seemed to bring a new, more shocking revelation or piece of evidence showing Trump to be unfit for the presidency: He had lost nearly $1 billion in a single year. He had likely not paid taxes in 18 years. He was running a \"university,\" for which he was under formal legal investigation. He had trampled on his own campaign's messaging by engaging in a Twitter crusade against a former beauty-pageant contestant. He had been denounced by leadership in his own party, and the trickle of prominent Republicans-both in and out of office-who had publicly repudiated him threatened to become a geyser. At this moment, the idea that a campaign so saturated in open bigotry, misogyny, chaos, and possible corruption could win a national election was ludicrous. This was America.\n\nThe president was going to North Carolina to keynote a campaign rally for Clinton, but first he was scheduled for a conversation about My Brother's Keeper, his initiative on behalf of disadvantaged youth. Announcing My Brother's Keeper-or MBK, as it's come to be called-in 2014, the president had sought to avoid giving the program a partisan valence, noting that it was \"not some big new government program.\" Instead, it would involve the government in concert with the nonprofit and business sectors to intervene in the lives of young men of color who were \"at risk.\" MBK serves as a kind of network for those elements of federal, state, and local government that might already have a presence in the lives of these young men. It is a quintessentially Obama program-conservative in scope, with impacts that are measurable.\n\n\"It comes right out of his own life,\" Broderick Johnson, the Cabinet secretary and an assistant to the president, who heads MBK, told me recently. \"I have heard him say, 'I don't want us to have a bunch of forums on race.' He reminds people, 'Yeah, we can talk about this. But what are we going to do ?' \" On this afternoon in North Carolina, what Obama did was sit with a group of young men who'd turned their lives around in part because of MBK. They told stories of being in the street, of choosing quick money over school, of their homes being shot up, and-through the help of mentoring or job programs brokered by MBK-transitioning into college or a job. Obama listened solemnly and empathetically to each of them. \"It doesn't take that much,\" he told them. \"It just takes someone laying hands on you and saying, 'Hey, man, you count.' \"\n\nWhen he asked the young men whether they had a message he should take back to policy makers in Washington, D.C., one observed that despite their best individual efforts, they still had to go back to the very same deprived neighborhoods that had been the sources of trouble for them. \"It's your environment,\" the young man said. \"You can do what you want, but you still gotta go back to the hood.\"\n\nHe was correct. The ghettos of America are the direct result of decades of public-policy decisions: the redlining of real-estate zoning maps, the expanded authority given to prosecutors, the increased funding given to prisons. And all of this was done on the backs of people still reeling from the 250-year legacy of slavery. The results of this negative investment are clear-African Americans rank at the bottom of nearly every major socioeconomic measure in the country.\n\nObama's formula for closing this chasm between black and white America, like that of many progressive politicians today, proceeded from policy designed for all of America. Blacks disproportionately benefit from this effort, since they are disproportionately in need. The Affordable Care Act, which cut the uninsured rate in the black community by at least a third, was Obama's most prominent example. Its full benefit has yet to be felt by African Americans, because several states in the South have declined to expand Medicaid. But when the president and I were meeting, the ACA's advocates believed that pressure on state budgets would force expansion, and there was evidence to support this: Louisiana had expanded Medicaid earlier in 2016, and advocates were gearing up for wars to be waged in Georgia and Virginia.\n\nObama also emphasized the need for a strong Justice Department with a deep commitment to nondiscrimination. When Obama moved into the White House in 2009, the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division \"was in shambles,\" former Attorney General Eric Holder told me recently. \"I mean, I had been there for 12 years as a line guy. I started out in '76, so I served under Republicans and Democrats. And what the [George W.] Bush administration, what the Bush DOJ did, was unlike anything that had ever happened before in terms of politicized hiring.\" The career civil servants below the political appointees, Holder said, were not even invited to the meetings in which the key hiring and policy decisions were made. After Obama's inauguration, Holder told me, \"I remember going to tell all the folks at the Civil Rights Division, 'The Civil Rights Division is open for business again.' The president gave me additional funds to hire people.\"\n\nThe political press developed a narrative that because Obama felt he had to modulate his rhetoric on race, Holder was the administration's true, and thus blacker, conscience. Holder is certainly blunter, and this worried some of the White House staff. Early in Obama's first term, Holder gave a speech on race in which he said the United States had been a \"nation of cowards\" on the subject. But positioning the two men as opposites elides an important fact: Holder was appointed by the president, and went only as far as the president allowed. I asked Holder whether he had toned down his rhetoric after that controversial speech. \"Nope,\" he said. Reflecting on his relationship with the president, Holder said, \"We were also kind of different people, you know? He is the Zen guy. And I'm kind of the hot-blooded West Indian. And I thought we made a good team, but there's nothing that I ever did or said that I don't think he would have said, 'I support him 100 percent.'\n\n\"Now, the 'nation of cowards' speech, the president might have used a different phrase-maybe, probably. But he and I share a worldview, you know? And when I hear people say, 'Well, you are blacker than him' or something like that, I think, What are you all talking about? \"\n\nFor much of his presidency, a standard portion of Obama's speeches about race riffed on black people's need to turn off the television, stop eating junk food, and stop blaming white people for their problems. Obama would deliver this lecture to any black audience, regardless of context. It was bizarre, for instance, to see the president warning young men who'd just graduated from Morehouse College, one of the most storied black colleges in the country, about making \"excuses\" and blaming whites.\n\nThis part of the Obama formula is the most troubling, and least thought-out. This judgment emerges from my own biography. I am the product of black parents who encouraged me to read, of black teachers who felt my work ethic did not match my potential, of black college professors who taught me intellectual rigor. And they did this in a world that every day insulted their humanity. It was not so much that the black layabouts and deadbeats Obama invoked in his speeches were unrecognizable. I had seen those people too. But I'd also seen the same among white people. If black men were overrepresented among drug dealers and absentee dads of the world, it was directly related to their being underrepresented among the Bernie Madoffs and Kenneth Lays of the world. Power was what mattered, and what characterized the differences between black and white America was not a difference in work ethic, but a system engineered to place one on top of the other.\n\nThe mark of that system is visible at every level of American society, regardless of the quality of one's choices. For instance, the unemployment rate among black college graduates (4.1 percent) is almost the same as the unemployment rate among white high-school graduates (4.6 percent). But that college degree is generally purchased at a higher price by blacks than by whites. According to research by the Brookings Institution, African Americans tend to carry more student debt four years after graduation ($53,000 versus $28,000) and suffer from a higher default rate on their loans (7.6 percent versus 2.4 percent) than white Americans. This is both the result and the perpetuator of a sprawling wealth gap between the races. White households, on average, hold seven times as much wealth as black households-a difference so large as to make comparing the \"black middle class\" and \"white middle class\" meaningless; they're simply not comparable. According to Patrick Sharkey, a sociologist at New York University who studies economic mobility, black families making $100,000 a year or more live in more-disadvantaged neighborhoods than white families making less than $30,000. This gap didn't just appear by magic; it's the result of the government's effort over many decades to create a pigmentocracy-one that will continue without explicit intervention.\n\nObama had been on the record as opposing reparations. But now, late in his presidency, he seemed more open to the idea-in theory, at least, if not in practice.\n\n\"Theoretically, you can make obviously a powerful argument that centuries of slavery, Jim Crow, discrimination are the primary cause for all those gaps,\" Obama said, referencing the gulf in education, wealth, and employment that separates black and white America. \"That those were wrongs to the black community as a whole, and black families specifically, and that in order to close that gap, a society has a moral obligation to make a large, aggressive investment, even if it's not in the form of individual reparations checks but in the form of a Marshall Plan.\"\n\nThe political problems with turning the argument for reparations into reality are manifold, Obama said. \"If you look at countries like South Africa, where you had a black majority, there have been efforts to tax and help that black majority, but it hasn't come in the form of a formal reparations program. You have countries like India that have tried to help untouchables, with essentially affirmative-action programs, but it hasn't fundamentally changed the structure of their societies. So the bottom line is that it's hard to find a model in which you can practically administer and sustain political support for those kinds of efforts.\"\n\nObama went on to say that it would be better, and more realistic, to get the country to rally behind a robust liberal agenda and build on the enormous progress that's been made toward getting white Americans to accept nondiscrimination as a basic operating premise. But the progress toward nondiscrimination did not appear overnight. It was achieved by people willing to make an unpopular argument and live on the frontier of public opinion. I asked him whether it wasn't-despite the practical obstacles-worth arguing that the state has a collective responsibility not only for its achievements but for its sins.\n\n\"I want my children-I want Malia and Sasha-to understand that they've got responsibilities beyond just what they themselves have done,\" Obama said. \"That they have a responsibility to the larger community and the larger nation, that they should be sensitive to and extra thoughtful about the plight of people who have been oppressed in the past, are oppressed currently. So that's a wisdom that I want to transmit to my kids ... But I would say that's a high level of enlightenment that you're looking to have from a majority of the society. And it may be something that future generations are more open to, but I am pretty confident that for the foreseeable future, using the argument of nondiscrimination, and 'Let's get it right for the kids who are here right now,' and giving them the best chance possible, is going to be a more persuasive argument.\"\n\nObama is unfailingly optimistic about the empathy and capabilities of the American people. His job necessitates this: \"At some level what the people want to feel is that the person leading them sees the best in them,\" he told me. But I found it interesting that that optimism does not extend to the possibility of the public's accepting wisdoms-such as the moral logic of reparations-that the president, by his own account, has accepted for himself and is willing to teach his children. Obama says he always tells his staff that \"better is good.\" The notion that a president would attempt to achieve change within the boundaries of the accepted consensus is appropriate. But Obama is almost constitutionally skeptical of those who seek to achieve change outside that consensus.\n\nEarly in 2016, Obama invited a group of African American leaders to meet with him at the White House. When some of the activists affiliated with Black Lives Matter refused to attend, Obama began calling them out in speeches. \"You can't refuse to meet because that might compromise the purity of your position,\" he said. \"The value of social movements and activism is to get you at the table, get you in the room, and then start trying to figure out how is this problem going to be solved. You then have a responsibility to prepare an agenda that is achievable-that can institutionalize the changes you seek-and to engage the other side.\"\n\nOpal Tometi, a Nigerian American community activist who is one of the three founders of Black Lives Matter, explained to me that the group has a more diffuse structure than most civil-rights organizations. One reason for this is to avoid the cult of personality that has plagued black organizations in the past. So the founders asked its membership in Chicago, the president's hometown, whether they should meet with Obama. \"They felt-and I think many of our members felt-there wouldn't be the depth of discussion that they wanted to have,\" Tometi told me. \"And if there wasn't that space to have a real heart-to-heart, and if it was just surface level, that it would be more of a disservice to the movement.\"\n\nTometi noted that some other activists allied with Black Lives Matter had been planning to attend the meeting, so they felt their views would be represented. Nevertheless, Black Lives Matter sees itself as engaged in a protest against the treatment of black people by the American state, and so Tometi and much of the group's leadership, concerned about being used for a photo op by the very body they were protesting, opted not to go.\n\nWhen I asked Obama about this perspective, he fluctuated between understanding where the activists were coming from and being hurt by such brush-offs. \"I think that where I've gotten frustrated during the course of my presidency has never been because I was getting pushed too hard by activists to see the justness of a cause or the essence of an issue,\" he said. \"I think where I got frustrated at times was the belief that the president can do anything if he just decides he wants to do it. And that sort of lack of awareness on the part of an activist about the constraints of our political system and the constraints on this office, I think, sometimes would leave me to mutter under my breath. Very rarely did I lose it publicly. Usually I'd just smile.\"\n\nHe laughed, then continued, \"The reason I say that is because those are the times where sometimes you feel actually a little bit hurt. Because you feel like saying to these folks, '[Don't] you think if I could do it, I [would] have just done it? Do you think that the only problem is that I don't care enough about the plight of poor people, or gay people?' \"\n\nI asked Obama whether he thought that perhaps protesters' distrust of the powers that be could ultimately be healthy. \"Yes,\" he said. \"Which is why I don't get too hurt. I mean, I think there is a benefit to wanting to hold power's feet to the fire until you actually see the goods. I get that. And I think it is important. And frankly, sometimes it's useful for activists just to be out there to keep you mindful and not get complacent, even if ultimately you think some of their criticism is misguided.\"\n\nObama himself was an activist and a community organizer, albeit for only two years-but he is not, by temperament, a protester. He is a consensus-builder; consensus, he believes, ultimately drives what gets done. He understands the emotional power of protest, the need to vent before authority-but that kind of approach does not come naturally to him. Regarding reparations, he said, \"Sometimes I wonder how much of these debates have to do with the desire, the legitimate desire, for that history to be recognized. Because there is a psychic power to the recognition that is not satisfied with a universal program; it's not satisfied by the Affordable Care Act, or an expansion of Pell Grants, or an expansion of the earned-income tax credit.\" These kinds of programs, effective and disproportionately beneficial to black people though they may be, don't \"speak to the hurt, and the sense of injustice, and the self-doubt that arises out of the fact that [African Americans] are behind now, and it makes us sometimes feel as if there must be something wrong with us-unless you're able to see the history and say, 'It's amazing we got this far given what we went through.'\n\n\"So in part, I think the argument sometimes that I've had with folks who are much more interested in sort of race-specific programs is less an argument about what is practically achievable and sometimes maybe more an argument of 'We want society to see what's happened and internalize it and answer it in demonstrable ways.' And those impulses I very much understand-but my hope would be that as we're moving through the world right now, we're able to get that psychological or emotional peace by seeing very concretely our kids doing better and being more hopeful and having greater opportunities.\"\n\nObama saw-at least at that moment, before the election of Donald Trump-a straight path to that world. \"Just play this out as a thought experiment,\" he said. \"Imagine if you had genuine, high-quality early-childhood education for every child, and suddenly every black child in America-but also every poor white child or Latino [child], but just stick with every black child in America-is getting a really good education. And they're graduating from high school at the same rates that whites are, and they are going to college at the same rates that whites are, and they are able to afford college at the same rates because the government has universal programs that say that you're not going to be barred from school just because of how much money your parents have.\n\n\"So now they're all graduating. And let's also say that the Justice Department and the courts are making sure, as I've said in a speech before, that when Jamal sends his résumé in, he's getting treated the same as when Johnny sends his résumé in. Now, are we going to have suddenly the same number of CEOs, billionaires, etc., as the white community? In 10 years? Probably not, maybe not even in 20 years.\n\n\"But I guarantee you that we would be thriving, we would be succeeding. We wouldn't have huge numbers of young African American men in jail. We'd have more family formation as college-graduated girls are meeting boys who are their peers, which then in turn means the next generation of kids are growing up that much better. And suddenly you've got a whole generation that's in a position to start using the incredible creativity that we see in music, and sports, and frankly even on the streets, channeled into starting all kinds of businesses. I feel pretty good about our odds in that situation.\"\n\nThe thought experiment doesn't hold up. The programs Obama favored would advance white America too-and without a specific commitment to equality, there is no guarantee that the programs would eschew discrimination. Obama's solution relies on a goodwill that his own personal history tells him exists in the larger country. My own history tells me something different. The large numbers of black men in jail, for instance, are not just the result of poor policy, but of not seeing those men as human.\n\nWhen President Obama and I had this conversation, the target he was aiming to reach seemed to me to be many generations away, and now-as President-Elect Trump prepares for office-seems even many more generations off. Obama's accomplishments were real: a $1 billion settlement on behalf of black farmers, a Justice Department that exposed Ferguson's municipal plunder, the increased availability of Pell Grants (and their availability to some prisoners), and the slashing of the crack/cocaine disparity in sentencing guidelines, to name just a few. Obama was also the first sitting president to visit a federal prison. There was a feeling that he'd erected a foundation upon which further progressive policy could be built. It's tempting to say that foundation is now endangered. The truth is, it was never safe.\n\nObama's greatest misstep was born directly out of his greatest insight. Only Obama, a black man who emerged from the best of white America, and thus could sincerely trust white America, could be so certain that he could achieve broad national appeal. And yet only a black man with that same biography could underestimate his opposition's resolve to destroy him. In some sense an Obama presidency could never have succeeded along the normal presidential lines; he needed a partner, or partners, in Congress who could put governance above party. But he struggled to win over even some of his own allies. Ben Nelson, the Democratic senator from Nebraska whom Obama helped elect, became an obstacle to health-care reform. Joe Lieberman, whom Obama saved from retribution at the hands of Senate Democrats after Lieberman campaigned for Obama's 2008 opponent, John McCain, similarly obstructed Obamacare. Among Republicans, senators who had seemed amenable to Obama's agenda-Chuck Grassley, Susan Collins, Richard Lugar, Olympia Snowe-rebuffed him repeatedly.\n\nThe obstruction grew out of narrow political incentives. \"If Republicans didn't cooperate,\" Obama told me, \"and there was not a portrait of bipartisan cooperation and a functional federal government, then the party in power would pay the price and they could win back the Senate and/or the House. That wasn't an inaccurate political calculation.\"\n\nObama is not sure of the degree to which individual racism played into this calculation. \"I do remember watching Bill Clinton get impeached and Hillary Clinton being accused of killing Vince Foster,\" he said. \"And if you ask them, I'm sure they would say, 'No, actually what you're experiencing is not because you're black, it's because you're a Democrat.' \"\n\nBut personal animus is just one manifestation of racism; arguably the more profound animosity occurs at the level of interests. The most recent Congress boasted 138 members from the states that comprised the old Confederacy. Of the 101 Republicans in that group, 96 are white and one is black. Of the 37 Democrats, 18 are black and 15 are white. There are no white congressional Democrats in the Deep South. Exit polls in Mississippi in 2008 found that 96 percent of voters who described themselves as Republicans were white. The Republican Party is not simply the party of whites, but the preferred party of whites who identify their interest as defending the historical privileges of whiteness. The researchers Josh Pasek, Jon A. Krosnick, and Trevor Tompson found that in 2012, 32 percent of Democrats held antiblack views, while 79 percent of Republicans did. These attitudes could even spill over to white Democratic politicians, because they are seen as representing the party of blacks. Studying the 2016 election, the political scientist Philip Klinkner found that the most predictive question for understanding whether a voter favored Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump was \"Is Barack Obama a Muslim?\"\n\nIn our conversations, Obama said he didn't doubt that there was a sincerely nonracist states'-rights contingent of the GOP. And yet he suspected that there might be more to it. \"A rudimentary knowledge of American history tells you that the relationship between the federal government and the states was very much mixed up with attitudes towards slavery, attitudes towards Jim Crow, attitudes towards antipoverty programs and who benefited and who didn't,\" he said.\n\n\"And so I'm careful not to attribute any particular resistance or slight or opposition to race. But what I do believe is that if somebody didn't have a problem with their daddy being employed by the federal government, and didn't have a problem with the Tennessee Valley Authority electrifying certain communities, and didn't have a problem with the interstate highway system being built, and didn't have a problem with the GI Bill, and didn't have a problem with the [Federal Housing Administration] subsidizing the suburbanization of America, and that all helped you build wealth and create a middle class-and then suddenly as soon as African Americans or Latinos are interested in availing themselves of those same mechanisms as ladders into the middle class, you now have a violent opposition to them-then I think you at least have to ask yourself the question of how consistent you are, and what's different, and what's changed.\"\n\nRacism greeted Obama in both his primary and general-election campaigns in 2008. Photos were circulated of him in Somali garb. Rush Limbaugh dubbed him \"Barack the Magic Negro.\" Roger Stone, who would go on to advise the Trump campaign, claimed that Michelle Obama could be heard on tape yelling \"Whitey.\" Detractors circulated emails claiming that the future first lady had written a racist senior thesis while at Princeton. A fifth of all West Virginia Democratic-primary voters in 2008 openly admitted that race had influenced their vote. Hillary Clinton trounced him 67 to 26 percent.\n\nAfter Obama won the presidency in defiance of these racial headwinds, traffic to the white-supremacist website Stormfront increased sixfold. Before the election, in August, just before the Democratic National Convention, the FBI uncovered an assassination plot hatched by white supremacists in Denver. Mainstream conservative publications floated the notion that Obama's memoir was too \"stylish and penetrating\" to have been written by the candidate, and found a plausible ghostwriter in the radical (and white) former Weatherman Bill Ayers. A Republican women's club in California dispensed \"Obama Bucks\" featuring slices of watermelon, ribs, and fried chicken. At the Values Voter Summit that year, conventioneers hawked \"Obama Waffles,\" a waffle mix whose box featured a bug-eyed caricature of the candidate. Fake hip-hop lyrics were scrawled on the side (\"Barry's Bling Bling Waffle Ring\") and on the top, the same caricature was granted a turban and tagged with the instructions \"Point box toward Mecca for tastier waffles.\" The display was denounced by the summit's sponsor, the Family Research Council. One would be forgiven for meeting this denunciation with guffaws: The council's president, Tony Perkins, had once addressed the white-supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens with a Confederate flag draped behind him. By 2015, Perkins had deemed the debate over Obama's birth certificate \"legitimate\" and was saying that it \"makes sense\" to conclude that Obama was actually a Muslim.\n\nBy then, birtherism-inflamed in large part by a real-estate mogul and reality-TV star named Donald Trump-had overtaken the Republican rank and file. In 2015, one poll found that 54 percent of GOP voters thought Obama was a Muslim. Only 29 percent believed he'd been born in America.\n\nStill, in 2008, Obama had been elected. His supporters rejoiced. As Jay-Z commemorated the occasion:\n\nNot quite. A month after Obama entered the White House, a CNBC personality named Rick Santelli took to the trading floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and denounced the president's efforts to help homeowners endangered by the housing crisis. \"How many of you people want to pay for your neighbor's mortgage that has an extra bathroom and can't pay their bills?,\" Santelli asked the assembled traders. He asserted that Obama should \"reward people that could carry the water\" as opposed to those who \"drink the water,\" and denounced those in danger of foreclosure as \"losers.\" Race was implicit in Santelli's harangue-the housing crisis and predatory lending had devastated black communities and expanded the wealth gap-and it culminated with a call for a \"Tea Party\" to resist the Obama presidency. In fact, right-wing ideologues had been planning just such a resistance for decades. They would eagerly answer Santelli's call.\n\nOne of the intellectual forerunners of the Tea Party is said to be Ron Paul, the heterodox two-time Republican presidential candidate, who opposed the war in Iraq and championed civil liberties. On other matters, Paul was more traditional. Throughout the '90s, he published a series of racist newsletters that referred to New York City as \"Welfaria,\" called Martin Luther King Jr. Day \"Hate Whitey Day,\" and asserted that 95 percent of black males in Washington, D.C., were either \"semi-criminal or entirely criminal.\" Paul's apologists have claimed that he had no real connection to the newsletters, even though virtually all of them were published in his name (\"The Ron Paul Survival Report,\" \"Ron Paul Political Report,\" \"Dr. Ron Paul's Freedom Report\") and written in his voice. Either way, the views of the newsletters have found their expression in his ideological comrades. Throughout Obama's first term, Tea Party activists voiced their complaints in racist terms. Activists brandished signs warning that Obama would implement \"white slavery,\" waved the Confederate flag, depicted Obama as a witch doctor, and issued calls for him to \"go back to Kenya.\" Tea Party supporters wrote \"satirical\" letters in the name of \"We Colored People\" and stoked the flames of birtherism. One of the Tea Party's most prominent sympathizers, the radio host Laura Ingraham, wrote a racist tract depicting Michelle Obama gorging herself on ribs, while Glenn Beck said the president was a \"racist\" with a \"deep-seated hatred for white people.\" The Tea Party's leading exponent, Andrew Breitbart, engineered the smearing of Shirley Sherrod, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's director of rural development for Georgia, publishing egregiously misleading videos that wrongly made her appear to be engaging in antiwhite racist invective, which led to her dismissal. (In a rare act of cowardice, the Obama administration cravenly submitted to this effort.)\n\nIn those rare moments when Obama made any sort of comment attacking racism, firestorms threatened to consume his governing agenda. When, in July 2009, the president objected to the arrest of the eminent Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. while he was trying to get into his own house, pointing out that the officer had \"acted stupidly,\" a third of whites said the remark made them feel less favorably toward the president, and nearly two-thirds claimed that Obama had \"acted stupidly\" by commenting. A chastened Obama then determined to make sure his public statements on race were no longer mere riffs but designed to have an achievable effect. This was smart, but still the invective came. During Obama's 2009 address on health care before a joint session of Congress, Joe Wilson, a Republican congressman from South Carolina, incredibly, and in defiance of precedent and decorum, disrupted the proceedings by crying out \"You lie!\" A Missouri congressman equated Obama with a monkey. A California GOP official took up the theme and emailed her friends an image depicting Obama as a chimp, with the accompanying text explaining, \"Now you know why [there's] no birth certificate!\" Former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin assessed the president's foreign policy as a \"shuck and jive shtick.\" Newt Gingrich dubbed him the \"food-stamp president.\" The rhetorical attacks on Obama were matched by a very real attack on his political base-in 2011 and 2012, 19 states enacted voting restrictions that made it harder for African Americans to vote.\n\nYet in 2012, as in 2008, Obama won anyway. Prior to the election, Obama, ever the optimist, had claimed that intransigent Republicans would decide to work with him to advance the country. No such collaboration was in the offing. Instead, legislation ground to a halt and familiar themes resurfaced. An Idaho GOP official posted a photo on Facebook depicting a trap waiting for Obama. The bait was a slice of watermelon. The caption read, \"Breaking: The secret service just uncovered a plot to kidnap the president. More details as we get them ...\" In 2014, conservatives assembled in support of Cliven Bundy's armed protest against federal grazing fees. As reporters descended on the Bundy ranch in Nevada, Bundy offered his opinions on \"the Negro.\" \"They abort their young children, they put their young men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton,\" Bundy explained. \"And I've often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy? They didn't get no more freedom. They got less freedom.\"\n\nThat same year, in the wake of Michael Brown's death, the Justice Department opened an investigation into the police department in Ferguson, Missouri. It found a city that, through racial profiling, arbitrary fines, and wanton harassment, had exploited law enforcement for the purposes of municipal plunder. The plunder was sanctified by racist humor dispensed via internal emails among the police that later came to light. The president of the United States, who during his first year in office had reportedly received three times the number of death threats of any of his predecessors, was a repeat target.\n\nMuch ink has been spilled in an attempt to understand the Tea Party protests, and the 2016 presidential candidacy of Donald Trump, which ultimately emerged out of them. One theory popular among (primarily) white intellectuals of varying political persuasions held that this response was largely the discontented rumblings of a white working class threatened by the menace of globalization and crony capitalism. Dismissing these rumblings as racism was said to condescend to this proletariat, which had long suffered the slings and arrows of coastal elites, heartless technocrats, and reformist snobs. Racism was not something to be coolly and empirically assessed but a slander upon the working man. Deindustrialization, globalization, and broad income inequality are real. And they have landed with at least as great a force upon black and Latino people in our country as upon white people. And yet these groups were strangely unrepresented in this new populism.\n\nChristopher S. Parker and Matt A. Barreto, political scientists at the University of Washington and UCLA, respectively, have found a relatively strong relationship between racism and Tea Party membership. \"Whites are less likely to be drawn to the Tea Party for material reasons, suggesting that, relative to other groups, it's really more about social prestige,\" they say. The notion that the Tea Party represented the righteous, if unfocused, anger of an aggrieved class allowed everyone from leftists to neoliberals to white nationalists to avoid a horrifying and simple reality: A significant swath of this country did not like the fact that their president was black, and that swath was not composed of those most damaged by an unquestioned faith in the markets. Far better to imagine the grievance put upon the president as the ghost of shambling factories and defunct union halls, as opposed to what it really was-a movement inaugurated by ardent and frightened white capitalists, raging from the commodities-trading floor of one of the great financial centers of the world.\n\nThat movement came into full bloom in the summer of 2015, with the candidacy of Donald Trump, a man who'd risen to political prominence by peddling the racist myth that the president was not American. It was birtherism-not trade, not jobs, not isolationism-that launched Trump's foray into electoral politics. Having risen unexpectedly on this basis into the stratosphere of Republican politics, Trump spent the campaign freely and liberally trafficking in misogyny, Islamophobia, and xenophobia. And on November 8, 2016, he won election to the presidency. Historians will spend the next century analyzing how a country with such allegedly grand democratic traditions was, so swiftly and so easily, brought to the brink of fascism. But one needn't stretch too far to conclude that an eight-year campaign of consistent and open racism aimed at the leader of the free world helped clear the way.\n\n\"They rode the tiger. And now the tiger is eating them,\" David Axelrod, speaking of the Republican Party, told me. That was in October. His words proved too optimistic. The tiger would devour us all.\n\nOne Saturday morning last May, I joined the presidential motorcade as it slipped out of the southern gate of the White House. A mostly white crowd had assembled. As the motorcade drove by, people cheered, held up their smartphones to record the procession, and waved American flags. To be within feet of the president seemed like the thrill of their lives. I was astounded. An old euphoria, which I could not immediately place, gathered up in me. And then I remembered, it was what I felt through much of 2008, as I watched Barack Obama's star shoot across the political sky. I had never seen so many white people cheer on a black man who was neither an athlete nor an entertainer. And it seemed that they loved him for this, and I thought in those days, which now feel so long ago, that they might then love me, too, and love my wife, and love my child, and love us all in the manner that the God they so fervently cited had commanded. I had been raised amid a people who wanted badly to believe in the possibility of a Barack Obama, even as their very lives argued against that possibility. So they would praise Martin Luther King Jr. in one breath and curse the white man, \"the Great Deceiver,\" in the next. Then came Obama and the Obama family, and they were black and beautiful in all the ways we aspired to be, and all that love was showered upon them. But as Obama's motorcade approached its destination-Howard University, where he would give the commencement address-the complexion of the crowd darkened, and I understood that the love was specific, that even if it allowed Barack Obama, even if it allowed the luckiest of us, to defy the boundaries, then the masses of us, in cities like this one, would still enjoy no such feat.\n\nThese were our fitful, spasmodic years.\n\nWe were launched into the Obama era with no notion of what to expect, if only because a black presidency had seemed such a dubious proposition. There was no preparation, because it would have meant preparing for the impossible. There were few assessments of its potential import, because such assessments were regarded as speculative fiction. In retrospect it all makes sense, and one can see a jagged but real political lineage running through black Chicago. It originates in Oscar Stanton De Priest; continues through Congressman William Dawson, who, under Roosevelt, switched from the Republican to the Democratic Party; crescendos with the legendary Harold Washington; rises still with Jesse Jackson's 1988 victory in Michigan's Democratic caucuses; rises again with Carol Moseley Braun's triumph; and reaches its recent apex with the election of Barack Obama. If the lineage is apparent in hindsight, so are the limits of presidential power. For a century after emancipation, quasi-slavery haunted the South. And more than half a century after Brown v. Board of Education , schools throughout much of this country remain segregated.\n\nThere are no clean victories for black people, nor, perhaps, for any people. The presidency of Barack Obama is no different. One can now say that an African American individual can rise to the same level as a white individual, and yet also say that the number of black individuals who actually qualify for that status will be small. One thinks of Serena Williams, whose dominance and stunning achievements can't, in and of themselves, ensure equal access to tennis facilities for young black girls. The gate is open and yet so very far away.\n\nI felt a mix of pride and amazement walking onto Howard's campus that day. Howard alumni, of which I am one, are an obnoxious fraternity, known for yelling the school chant across city blocks, sneering at other historically black colleges and universities, and condescending to black graduates of predominantly white institutions. I like to think I am more reserved, but I felt an immense satisfaction in being in the library where I had once found my history, and now found myself with the first black president of the United States. It seemed providential that he would give the commencement address here in his last year. The same pride I felt radiated out across the Yard, the large green patch in the main area of the campus where the ceremony would take place. When Obama walked out, the audience exploded, and when the time came for the color guard to present arms, a chant arose: \"O-Ba-Ma! O-Ba-Ma! O-Ba-Ma!\"\n\nHe gave a good speech that day, paying heed to Howard's rituals, calling out its famous alumni, shouting out the university's various dormitories, and urging young people to vote. (His usual riff on respectability politics was missing.) But I think he could have stood before that crowd, smiled, and said \"Good luck,\" and they would have loved him anyway. He was their champion, and this was evident in the smallest of things. The national anthem was played first, but then came the black national anthem, \"Lift Every Voice and Sing.\" As the lyrics rang out over the crowd, the students held up the black-power fist-a symbol of defiance before power. And yet here, in the face of a black man in his last year in power, it scanned not as a protest, but as a salute.\n\nSix months later the awful price of a black presidency would be known to those students, even as the country seemed determined not to acknowledge it. In the days after Donald Trump's victory, there would be an insistence that something as \"simple\" as racism could not explain it. As if enslavement had nothing to do with global economics, or as if lynchings said nothing about the idea of women as property. As though the past 400 years could be reduced to the irrational resentment of full lips. No. Racism is never simple. And there was nothing simple about what was coming, or about Obama, the man who had unwittingly summoned this future into being.\n\nIt was said that the Americans who'd supported Trump were victims of liberal condescension. The word racist would be dismissed as a profane slur put upon the common man, as opposed to an accurate description of actual men. \"We simply don't yet know how much racism or misogyny motivated Trump voters,\" David Brooks would write in The New York Times . \"If you were stuck in a jobless town, watching your friends OD on opiates, scrambling every month to pay the electric bill, and then along came a guy who seemed able to fix your problems and hear your voice, maybe you would stomach some ugliness, too.\" This strikes me as perfectly logical. Indeed, it could apply just as well to Louis Farrakhan's appeal to the black poor and working class. But whereas the followers of an Islamophobic white nationalist enjoy the sympathy that must always greet the salt of the earth, the followers of an anti-Semitic black nationalist endure the scorn that must ever greet the children of the enslaved.\n\nMuch would be made of blue-collar voters in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan who'd pulled the lever for Obama in 2008 and 2012 and then for Trump in 2016. Surely these voters disproved racism as an explanatory force. It's still not clear how many individual voters actually flipped. But the underlying presumption-that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama could be swapped in for each other-exhibited a problem. Clinton was a candidate who'd won one competitive political race in her life, whose political instincts were questioned by her own advisers, who took more than half a million dollars in speaking fees from an investment bank because it was \"what they offered,\" who proposed to bring back to the White House a former president dogged by allegations of rape and sexual harassment. Obama was a candidate who'd become only the third black senator in the modern era; who'd twice been elected president, each time flipping red and purple states; who'd run one of the most scandal-free administrations in recent memory. Imagine an African American facsimile of Hillary Clinton: She would never be the nominee of a major political party and likely would not be in national politics at all.\n\nPointing to citizens who voted for both Obama and Trump does not disprove racism; it evinces it. To secure the White House, Obama needed to be a Harvard-trained lawyer with a decade of political experience and an incredible gift for speaking to cross sections of the country; Donald Trump needed only money and white bluster.\n\nIn the week after the election, I was a mess. I had not seen my wife in two weeks. I was on deadline for this article. My son was struggling in school. The house was in disarray. I played Marvin Gaye endlessly-\"When you left, you took all of me with you.\" Friends began to darkly recall the ghosts of post-Reconstruction. The election of Donald Trump confirmed everything I knew of my country and none of what I could accept. The idea that America would follow its first black president with Donald Trump accorded with its history. I was shocked at my own shock. I had wanted Obama to be right.\n\nI still want Obama to be right. I still would like to fold myself into the dream. This will not be possible.\n\nBy some cosmic coincidence, a week after the election I received a portion of my father's FBI file I was made aware of the FBI file by the diligent work of researchers from the show Finding Your Roots . I was taping an episode on my family the day of my last interview with the president. . My father had grown up poor in Philadelphia. His father was struck dead on the street. His grandfather was crushed to death in a meatpacking plant. He'd served his country in Vietnam, gotten radicalized there, and joined the Black Panther Party, which brought him to the attention of J. Edgar Hoover. A memo written to the FBI director was \"submitted aimed at discrediting WILLIAM PAUL COATES, Acting Captain of the BPP, Baltimore.\" The memo proposed that a fake letter be sent to the Panthers' co-founder Huey P. Newton. The fake letter accused my father of being an informant and concluded, \"I want somethin done with this bootlikin facist pig nigger and I want it done now.\" The words somethin done need little interpretation. The Panthers were eventually consumed by an internecine war instigated by the FBI, one in which being labeled a police informant was a death sentence.\n\nA few hours after I saw this file, I had my last conversation with the president. I asked him how his optimism was holding up, given Trump's victory. He confessed to being surprised at the outcome but said that it was tough to \"draw a grand theory from it, because there were some very unusual circumstances.\" He pointed to both candidates' high negatives, the media coverage, and a \"dispirited\" electorate. But he said that his general optimism about the shape of American history remained unchanged. \"To be optimistic about the long-term trends of the United States doesn't mean that everything is going to go in a smooth, direct, straight line,\" he said. \"It goes forward sometimes, sometimes it goes back, sometimes it goes sideways, sometimes it zigs and zags.\"\n\nI thought of Hoover's FBI, which harassed three generations of black activists, from Marcus Garvey's black nationalists to Martin Luther King Jr.'s integrationists to Huey Newton's Black Panthers, including my father. And I thought of the enormous power accrued to the presidency in the post-9/11 era-the power to obtain American citizens' phone records en masse, to access their emails, to detain them indefinitely. I asked the president whether it was all worth it. Whether this generation of black activists and their allies should be afraid.\n\n\"Keep in mind that the capacity of the NSA, or other surveillance tools, are specifically prohibited from being applied to U.S. citizens or U.S. persons without specific evidence of links to terrorist activity or, you know, other foreign-related activity,\" he said. \"So, you know, I think this whole story line that somehow Big Brother has massively expanded and now that a new president is in place it's this loaded gun ready to be used on domestic dissent is just not accurate.\"\n\nHe counseled vigilance, \"because the possibility of abuse by government officials always exists. The issue is not going to be that there are new tools available; the issue is making sure that the incoming administration, like my administration, takes the constraints on how we deal with U.S. citizens and persons seriously.\" This answer did not fill me with confidence. The next day, President-Elect Trump offered Lieutenant General Michael Flynn the post of national-security adviser and picked Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama as his nominee for attorney general. Last February, Flynn tweeted, \"Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL\" and linked to a YouTube video that declared followers of Islam want \"80 percent of humanity enslaved or exterminated.\" Sessions had once been accused of calling a black lawyer \"boy,\" claiming that a white lawyer who represented black clients was a disgrace to his race, and joking that he thought the Ku Klux Klan \"was okay until I found out they smoked pot.\" I felt then that I knew what was coming-more Freddie Grays, more Rekia Boyds, more informants and undercover officers sent to infiltrate mosques.\n\nAnd I also knew that the man who could not countenance such a thing in his America had been responsible for the only time in my life when I felt, as the first lady had once said, proud of my country, and I knew that it was his very lack of countenance, his incredible faith, his improbable trust in his countrymen, that had made that feeling possible. The feeling was that little black boy touching the president's hair. It was watching Obama on the campaign trail, always expecting the worst and amazed that the worst never happened. It was how I'd felt seeing Barack and Michelle during the inauguration, the car slow-dragging down Pennsylvania Avenue, the crowd cheering, and then the two of them rising up out of the limo, rising up from fear, smiling, waving, defying despair, defying history, defying gravity.\n\nTheAtlantic.com Copyright (c) 2025 by The Atlantic Monthly Group.

Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby\n\nIn the waning days of President Barack Obama's administration, he and his wife, Michelle, hosted a farewell party, the full import of which no one could then grasp. It was late October, Friday the 21st, and the president had spent many of the previous weeks, as he would spend the two subsequent weeks, campaigning for the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. Things were looking up. Polls in the crucial states of Virginia and Pennsylvania showed Clinton with solid advantages. The formidable GOP strongholds of Georgia and Texas were said to be under threat. The moment seemed to buoy Obama. He had been light on his feet in these last few weeks, cracking jokes at the expense of Republican opponents and laughing off hecklers. At a rally in Orlando on October 28, he greeted a student who would be introducing him by dancing toward her and then noting that the song playing over the loudspeakers-the Gap Band's \"Outstanding\"-was older than she was. \"This is classic!\" he said. Then he flashed the smile that had launched America's first black presidency, and started dancing again. Three months still remained before Inauguration Day, but staffers had already begun to count down the days. They did this with a mix of pride and longing-like college seniors in early May. They had no sense of the world they were graduating into. None of us did.\n\nThe farewell party, presented by BET (Black Entertainment Television), was the last in a series of concerts the first couple had hosted at the White House. Guests were asked to arrive at 5:30 p.m. By 6, two long lines stretched behind the Treasury Building, where the Secret Service was checking names. The people in these lines were, in the main, black, and their humor reflected it. The brisker queue was dubbed the \"good-hair line\" by one guest, and there was laughter at the prospect of the Secret Service subjecting us all to a \"brown-paper-bag test.\" This did not come to pass, but security was tight. Several guests were told to stand in a makeshift pen and wait to have their backgrounds checked a second time.\n\nListen to the audio version of this article: Download the Audm app for your iPhone to listen to more titles.\n\nDave Chappelle was there. He coolly explained the peril and promise of comedy in what was then still only a remotely potential Donald Trump presidency: \"I mean, we never had a guy have his own pussygate scandal.\" Everyone laughed. A few weeks later, he would be roundly criticized for telling a crowd at the Cutting Room, in New York, that he had voted for Clinton but did not feel good about it. \"She's going to be on a coin someday,\" Chappelle said. \"And her behavior has not been coinworthy.\" But on this crisp October night, everything felt inevitable and grand. There was a slight wind. It had been in the 80s for much of that week. Now, as the sun set, the season remembered its name. Women shivered in their cocktail dresses. Gentlemen chivalrously handed over their suit coats. But when Naomi Campbell strolled past the security pen in a sleeveless number, she seemed as invulnerable as ever.\n\nCellphones were confiscated to prevent surreptitious recordings from leaking out. (This effort was unsuccessful. The next day, a partygoer would tweet a video of the leader of the free world dancing to Drake's \"Hotline Bling.\") After withstanding the barrage of security, guests were welcomed into the East Wing of the White House, and then ushered back out into the night, where they boarded a succession of orange-and-green trolleys. The singer and actress Janelle Monáe, her famous and fantastic pompadour preceding her, stepped on board and joked with a companion about the historical import of \"sitting in the back of the bus.\" She took a seat three rows from the front and hummed into the night. The trolley dropped the guests on the South Lawn, in front of a giant tent. The South Lawn's fountain was lit up with blue lights. The White House proper loomed like a ghost in the distance. I heard the band, inside, beginning to play Al Green's \"Let's Stay Together.\"\n\n\"Well, you can tell what type of night this is,\" Obama said from the stage, opening the event. \"Not the usual ruffles and flourishes!\"\n\nThe crowd roared.\n\n\"This must be a BET event!\"\n\nThe crowd roared louder still.\n\nObama placed the concert in the White House's musical tradition, noting that guests of the Kennedys had once done the twist at the residence-\"the twerking of their time,\" he said, before adding, \"There will be no twerking tonight. At least not by me.\"\n\nThe Obamas are fervent and eclectic music fans. In the past eight years, they have hosted performances at the White House by everyone from Mavis Staples to Bob Dylan to Tony Bennett to the Blind Boys of Alabama. After the rapper Common was invited to perform in 2011, a small fracas ensued in the right-wing media. He performed anyway-and was invited back again this glorious fall evening and almost stole the show. The crowd sang along to the hook for his hit ballad \"The Light.\" And when he brought on the gospel singer Yolanda Adams to fill in for John Legend on the Oscar-winning song \"Glory,\" glee turned to rapture.\n\nDe La Soul was there. The hip-hop trio had come of age as boyish B-boys with Gumby-style high-top fades. Now they moved across the stage with a lovely mix of lethargy and grace, like your favorite uncle making his way down the Soul Train line, wary of throwing out a hip. I felt a sense of victory watching them rock the crowd, all while keeping it in the pocket. The victory belonged to hip-hop-an art form birthed in the burning Bronx and now standing full grown, at the White House, unbroken and unedited. Usher led the crowd in a call-and-response: \"Say it loud, I'm black and I'm proud.\" Jill Scott showed off her operatic chops. Bell Biv DeVoe, contemporaries of De La, made history with their performance by surely becoming the first group to suggest to a presidential audience that one should \"never trust a big butt and a smile.\"\n\nThe ties between the Obama White House and the hip-hop community are genuine. The Obamas are social with Beyoncé and Jay-Z. They hosted Chance the Rapper and Frank Ocean at a state dinner, and last year invited Swizz Beatz, Busta Rhymes, and Ludacris, among others, to discuss criminal-justice reform and other initiatives. Obama once stood in the Rose Garden passing large flash cards to the Hamilton creator and rapper Lin-Manuel Miranda, who then freestyled using each word on the cards. \"Drop the beat,\" Obama said, inaugurating the session. At 55, Obama is younger than pioneering hip-hop artists like Afrika Bambaataa, DJ Kool Herc, and Kurtis Blow. If Obama's enormous symbolic power draws primarily from being the country's first black president, it also draws from his membership in hip-hop's foundational generation.\n\nThat night, the men were sharp in their gray or black suits and optional ties. Those who were not in suits had chosen to make a statement, like the dark-skinned young man who strolled in, sockless, with blue jeans cuffed so as to accentuate his gorgeous black-suede loafers. Everything in his ensemble seemed to say, \"My fellow Americans, do not try this at home.\" There were women in fur jackets and high heels; others with sculpted naturals, the sides shaved close, the tops blooming into curls; others still in gold bamboo earrings and long blond dreads. When the actor Jesse Williams took the stage, seemingly awed before such black excellence, before such black opulence, assembled just feet from where slaves had once toiled, he simply said, \"Look where we are. Look where we are right now.\"\n\nThis would not happen again, and everyone knew it. It was not just that there might never be another African American president of the United States. It was the feeling that this particular black family, the Obamas, represented the best of black people, the ultimate credit to the race, incomparable in elegance and bearing. \"There are no more,\" the comedian Sinbad joked back in 2010. \"There are no black men raised in Kansas and Hawaii. That's the last one. Y'all better treat this one right. The next one gonna be from Cleveland. He gonna wear a perm. Then you gonna see what it's really like.\" Throughout their residency, the Obamas had refrained from showing America \"what it's really like,\" and had instead followed the first lady's motto, \"When they go low, we go high.\" This was the ideal-black and graceful under fire-saluted that evening. The president was lionized as \"our crown jewel.\" The first lady was praised as the woman \"who put the O in Obama .\"\n\nBarack Obama's victories in 2008 and 2012 were dismissed by some of his critics as merely symbolic for African Americans. But there is nothing \"mere\" about symbols. The power embedded in the word nigger is also symbolic. Burning crosses do not literally raise the black poverty rate, and the Confederate flag does not directly expand the wealth gap.\n\nMuch as the unbroken ranks of 43 white male presidents communicated that the highest office of government in the country-indeed, the most powerful political offices in the world-was off-limits to black individuals, the election of Barack Obama communicated that the prohibition had been lifted. It communicated much more. Before Obama triumphed in 2008, the most-famous depictions of black success tended to be entertainers or athletes. But Obama had shown that it was \"possible to be smart and cool at the same damn time,\" as Jesse Williams put it at the BET party. Moreover, he had not embarrassed his people with a string of scandals. Against the specter of black pathology, against the narrow images of welfare moms and deadbeat dads, his time in the White House had been an eight-year showcase of a healthy and successful black family spanning three generations, with two dogs to boot. In short, he became a symbol of black people's everyday, extraordinary Americanness.\n\nWhiteness in America is a different symbol-a badge of advantage. In a country of professed meritocratic competition, this badge has long ensured an unerring privilege, represented in a 220-year monopoly on the highest office in the land. For some not-insubstantial sector of the country, the elevation of Barack Obama communicated that the power of the badge had diminished. For eight long years, the badge-holders watched him. They saw footage of the president throwing bounce passes and shooting jumpers. They saw him enter a locker room, give a businesslike handshake to a white staffer, and then greet Kevin Durant with something more soulful. They saw his wife dancing with Jimmy Fallon and posing, resplendent, on the covers of magazines that had, only a decade earlier, been almost exclusively, if unofficially, reserved for ladies imbued with the great power of the badge.\n\nFor the preservation of the badge, insidious rumors were concocted to denigrate the first black White House. Obama gave free cellphones to disheveled welfare recipients. Obama went to Europe and complained that \"ordinary men and women are too small-minded to govern their own affairs.\" Obama had inscribed an Arabic saying on his wedding ring, then stopped wearing the ring, in observance of Ramadan. He canceled the National Day of Prayer; refused to sign certificates for Eagle Scouts; faked his attendance at Columbia University; and used a teleprompter to address a group of elementary-school students. The badge-holders fumed. They wanted their country back. And, though no one at the farewell party knew it, in a couple of weeks they would have it.\n\nOn this October night, though, the stage belonged to another America. At the end of the party, Obama looked out into the crowd, searching for Dave Chappelle. \"Where's Dave?\" he cried. And then, finding him, the president referenced Chappelle's legendary Brooklyn concert. \"You got your block party. I got my block party.\" Then the band struck up Al Green's \"Love and Happiness\"-the evening's theme. The president danced in a line next to Ronnie DeVoe. Together they mouthed the lyrics: \"Make you do right. Love will make you do wrong.\"\n\nLast spring , I went to the White House to meet the president for lunch. I arrived slightly early and sat in the waiting area. I was introduced to a deaf woman who worked as the president's receptionist, a black woman who worked in the press office, a Muslim woman in a head scarf who worked on the National Security Council, and an Iranian American woman who worked as a personal aide to the president. This receiving party represented a healthy cross section of the people Donald Trump had been mocking, and would continue to spend his campaign mocking. At the time, the president seemed untroubled by Trump. When I told Obama that I thought Trump's candidacy was an explicit reaction to the fact of a black president, he said he could see that, but then enumerated other explanations. When assessing Trump's chances, he was direct: He couldn't win.\n\nSubscribe to The Atlantic and support 160 years of independent journalism\n\nThis assessment was born out of the president's innate optimism and unwavering faith in the ultimate wisdom of the American people-the same traits that had propelled his unlikely five-year ascent from assemblyman in the Illinois state legislature to U.S. senator to leader of the free world. The speech that launched his rise, the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, emerged right from this logic. He addressed himself to his \"fellow Americans, Democrats, Republicans, independents,\" all of whom, he insisted, were more united than they had been led to believe. America was home to devout worshippers and Little League coaches in blue states, civil libertarians and \"gay friends\" in red states. The presumably white \"counties around Chicago\" did not want their taxes burned on welfare, but they didn't want them wasted on a bloated Pentagon budget either. Inner-city black families, no matter their perils, understood \"that government alone can't teach our kids to learn ... that children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white.\"\n\nPerceived differences were the work of \"spinmasters and negative-ad peddlers who embrace the politics of 'anything goes.' \" Real America had no use for such categorizations. By Obama's lights, there was no liberal America, no conservative America, no black America, no white America, no Latino America, no Asian America, only \"the United States of America.\" All these disparate strands of the American experience were bound together by a common hope:\n\nThis speech ran counter to the history of the people it sought to address. Some of those same immigrants had firebombed the homes of the children of those same slaves. That young naval lieutenant was an imperial agent for a failed, immoral war. American division was real. In 2004, John Kerry did not win a single southern state. But Obama appealed to a belief in innocence-in particular a white innocence-that ascribed the country's historical errors more to misunderstanding and the work of a small cabal than to any deliberate malevolence or widespread racism. America was good. America was great.\n\nOver the next 12 years, I came to regard Obama as a skilled politician, a deeply moral human being, and one of the greatest presidents in American history. He was phenomenal-the most agile interpreter and navigator of the color line I had ever seen. He had an ability to emote a deep and sincere connection to the hearts of black people, while never doubting the hearts of white people. This was the core of his 2004 keynote, and it marked his historic race speech during the 2008 campaign at Philadelphia's National Constitution Center-and blinded him to the appeal of Trump. (\"As a general proposition, it's hard to run for president by telling people how terrible things are,\" Obama once said to me.)\n\nBut if the president's inability to cement his legacy in the form of Hillary Clinton proved the limits of his optimism, it also revealed the exceptional nature of his presidential victories. For eight years Barack Obama walked on ice and never fell. Nothing in that time suggested that straight talk on the facts of racism in American life would have given him surer footing.\n\nI had met the president a few times before. In his second term, I'd written articles criticizing him for his overriding trust in color-blind policy and his embrace of \"personal responsibility\" rhetoric when speaking to African Americans. I saw him as playing both sides. He would invoke his identity as a president of all people to decline to advocate for black policy-and then invoke his black identity to lecture black people for continuing to \"make bad choices.\" In response, Obama had invited me, along with other journalists, to the White House for off-the-record conversations. I attempted to press my points in these sessions. My efforts were laughable and ineffective. I was always inappropriately dressed, and inappropriately calibrated in tone: In one instance, I was too deferential; in another, too bellicose. I was discombobulated by fear-not by fear of the power of his office (though that is a fearsome and impressive thing) but by fear of his obvious brilliance. It is said that Obama speaks \"professorially,\" a fact that understates the quickness and agility of his mind. These were not like press conferences-the president would speak in depth and with great familiarity about a range of subjects. Once, I watched him effortlessly reply to queries covering everything from electoral politics to the American economy to environmental policy. And then he turned to me. I thought of George Foreman, who once booked an exhibition with multiple opponents in which he pounded five straight journeymen-and I suddenly had some idea of how it felt to be the last of them.\n\nLast spring, we had a light lunch. We talked casually and candidly. He talked about the brilliance of LeBron James and Stephen Curry-not as basketball talents but as grounded individuals. I asked him whether he was angry at his father, who had abandoned him at a young age to move back to Kenya, and whether that motivated any of his rhetoric. He said it did not, and he credited the attitude of his mother and grandparents for this. Then it was my turn to be autobiographical. I told him that I had heard the kind of \"straighten up\" talk he had been giving to black youth, for instance in his 2013 Morehouse commencement address, all my life. I told him that I thought it was not sensitive to the inner turmoil that can be obscured by the hardness kids often evince. I told him I thought this because I had once been one of those kids. He seemed to concede this point, but I couldn't tell whether it mattered to him. Nonetheless, he agreed to a series of more formal conversations on this and other topics.\n\nThe improbability of a black president had once been so strong that its most vivid representations were comedic. Witness Dave Chappelle's profane Black Bush from the early 2000s (\"This nigger very possibly has weapons of mass destruction! I can't sleep on that!\") or Richard Pryor's black president in the 1970s promising black astronauts and black quarterbacks (\"Ever since the Rams got rid of James Harris, my jaw's been uptight!\"). In this model, so potent is the force of blackness that the presidency is forced to conform to it. But once the notion advanced out of comedy and into reality, the opposite proved to be true.\n\nObama's DNC speech is the key. It does not belong to the literature of \"the struggle\"; it belongs to the literature of prospective presidents-men (as it turns out) who speak not to gravity and reality, but to aspirations and dreams. When Lincoln invoked the dream of a nation \"conceived in liberty\" and pledged to the ideal that \"all men are created equal,\" he erased the near-extermination of one people and the enslavement of another. When Roosevelt told the country that \"the only thing we have to fear is fear itself,\" he invoked the dream of American omnipotence and boundless capability. But black people, then living under a campaign of terror for more than half a century, had quite a bit to fear, and Roosevelt could not save them. The dream Ronald Reagan invoked in 1984-that \"it's morning again in America\"-meant nothing to the inner cities, besieged as they were by decades of redlining policies, not to mention crack and Saturday-night specials. Likewise, Obama's keynote address conflated the slave and the nation of immigrants who profited from him. To reinforce the majoritarian dream, the nightmare endured by the minority is erased. That is the tradition to which the \"skinny kid with a funny name\" who would be president belonged. It is also the only tradition in existence that could have possibly put a black person in the White House.\n\nObama's embrace of white innocence was demonstrably necessary as a matter of political survival. Whenever he attempted to buck this directive, he was disciplined. His mild objection to the arrest of Henry Louis Gates Jr. in 2009 contributed to his declining favorability numbers among whites-still a majority of voters. His comments after the killing of Trayvon Martin-\"If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon\"-helped make that tragedy a rallying point for people who did not care about Martin's killer as much as they cared about finding ways to oppose the president. Michael Tesler, a political-science professor at UC Irvine, has studied the effect of Obama's race on the American electorate. \"No other factor, in fact, came close to dividing the Democratic primary electorate as powerfully as their feelings about African Americans,\" he and his co-author, David O. Sears, concluded in their book, Obama's Race: The 2008 Election and the Dream of a Post-Racial America . \"The impact of racial attitudes on individual vote decisions ... was so strong that it appears to have even outstripped the substantive impact of racial attitudes on Jesse Jackson's more racially charged campaign for the nomination in 1988.\" When Tesler looked at the 2012 campaign in his second book, Post-Racial or Most-Racial? Race and Politics in the Obama Era , very little had improved. Analyzing the extent to which racial attitudes affected people associated with Obama during the 2012 election, Tesler concluded that \"racial attitudes spilled over from Barack Obama into mass assessments of Mitt Romney, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Charlie Crist, and even the Obama family's dog Bo.\"\n\nYet despite this entrenched racial resentment, and in the face of complete resistance by congressional Republicans, overtly launched from the moment Obama arrived in the White House, the president accomplished major feats. He remade the nation's health-care system. He revitalized a Justice Department that vigorously investigated police brutality and discrimination, and he began dismantling the private-prison system for federal inmates. Obama nominated the first Latina justice to the Supreme Court, gave presidential support to marriage equality, and ended the U.S. military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, thus honoring the civil-rights tradition that had inspired him. And if his very existence inflamed America's racist conscience, it also expanded the country's anti-racist imagination. Millions of young people now know their only president to have been an African American. Writing for The New Yorker , Jelani Cobb once noted that \"until there was a black Presidency it was impossible to conceive of the limitations of one.\" This is just as true of the possibilities. In 2014, the Obama administration committed itself to reversing the War on Drugs through the power of presidential commutation. The administration said that it could commute the sentences of as many as 10,000 prisoners. As of November, the president had commuted only 944 sentences. By any measure, Obama's effort fell woefully short, except for this small one: the measure of almost every other modern president who preceded him. Obama's 944 commutations are the most in nearly a century-and more than the past 11 presidents' combined.\n\nObama was born into a country where laws barring his very conception-let alone his ascendancy to the presidency-had long stood in force. A black president would always be a contradiction for a government that, throughout most of its history, had oppressed black people. The attempt to resolve this contradiction through Obama-a black man with deep roots in the white world-was remarkable. The price it exacted, incredible. The world it gave way to, unthinkable.\n\nWhen Barack Obama was 10, his father gave him a basketball, a gift that connected the two directly. Obama was born in 1961 in Hawaii and raised by his mother, Ann Dunham, who was white, and her parents, Stanley and Madelyn. They loved him ferociously, supported him emotionally, and encouraged him intellectually. They also told him he was black. Ann gave him books to read about famous black people. When Obama's mother had begun dating his father, the news had not been greeted with the threat of lynching (as it might have been in various parts of the continental United States), and Obama's grandparents always spoke positively of his father. This biography makes Obama nearly unique among black people of his era.\n\nIn the president's memoir, Dreams From My Father , he says he was not an especially talented basketball player, but he played with a consuming passion. That passion was directed at something more than just the mastering of the pick-and-roll or the perfecting of his jump shot. Obama came of age during the time of the University of Hawaii basketball team's \"Fabulous Five\"-a name given to its all-black starting five, two decades before it would be resurrected at the University of Michigan by the likes of Chris Webber and Jalen Rose. In his memoir, Obama writes that he would watch the University of Hawaii players laughing at \"some inside joke,\" winking \"at the girls on the sidelines,\" or \"casually flipping lay-ups.\" What Obama saw in the Fabulous Five was not just game, but a culture he found attractive:\n\nThese are lessons, particularly the last one, that for black people apply as much on the street as they do on the court. Basketball was a link for Obama, a medium for downloading black culture from the mainland that birthed the Fabulous Five. Assessing his own thought process at the time, Obama writes, \"I decided to become part of that world.\" This is one of the most incredible sentences ever written in the long, decorated history of black memoir, if only because very few black people have ever enjoyed enough power to write it.\n\nHistorically, in black autobiography, to be remanded into the black race has meant exposure to a myriad of traumas, often commencing in childhood. Frederick Douglass is separated from his grandmother. The enslaved Harriet Ann Jacobs must constantly cope with the threat of rape before she escapes. After telling his teacher he wants to be a lawyer, Malcolm X is told that the job isn't for \"niggers.\" Black culture often serves as the balm for such traumas, or even the means to resist them. Douglass finds the courage to face the \"slave-breaker\" Edward Covey after being given an allegedly enchanted root by \"a genuine African\" possessing powers from \"the eastern nations.\" Malcolm X's dancing connects him to his \"long-suppressed African instincts.\" If black racial identity speaks to all the things done to people of recent African ancestry, black cultural identity was created in response to them. The division is not neat; the two are linked, and it is incredibly hard to be a full participant in the world of cultural identity without experiencing the trauma of racial identity.\n\nObama is somewhat different. He writes of bloodying the nose of a white kid who called him a \"coon,\" and of chafing at racist remarks from a tennis coach, and of feeling offended after a white woman in his apartment building told the manager that he was following her. But the kinds of traumas that marked African Americans of his generation-beatings at the hands of racist police, being herded into poor schools, grinding out a life in a tenement building-were mostly abstract for him. Moreover, the kind of spatial restriction that most black people feel at an early age-having rocks thrown at you for being on the wrong side of the tracks, for instance-was largely absent from his life. In its place, Obama was gifted with a well-stamped passport and admittance to elite private schools-all of which spoke of other identities, other lives and other worlds where the color line was neither determinative nor especially relevant. Obama could have grown into a raceless cosmopolitan. Surely he would have lived in a world of problems, but problems not embodied by him.\n\nInstead, he decided to enter this world.\n\n\"I always felt as if being black was cool,\" Obama told me while traveling to a campaign event. He was sitting on Air Force One , his tie loosened, his shirtsleeves rolled up. \"[Being black] was not something to run away from but something to embrace. Why that is, I think, is complicated. Part of it is I think that my mother thought black folks were cool, and if your mother loves you and is praising you-and says you look good, are smart-as you are, then you don't kind of think in terms of How can I avoid this? You feel pretty good about it.\"\n\nAs a child, Obama's embrace of blackness was facilitated, not impeded, by white people. Obama's mother pointed him toward the history and culture of African Americans. Stanley, his grandfather, who came originally from Kansas, took him to basketball games at the University of Hawaii, as well as to black bars. Stanley introduced him to the black writer Frank Marshall Davis. The facilitation was as much indirect as direct. Obama recalls watching his grandfather at those black bars and understanding that \"most of the people in the bar weren't there out of choice,\" and that \"our presence there felt forced.\" From his mother's life of extensive travel, he learned to value the significance of having a home.\n\nThat suspicion of rootlessness extends throughout Dreams From My Father . He describes integration as a \"one-way street\" on which black people are asked to abandon themselves to fully experience America's benefits. Confronted with a woman named Joyce, a mixed-race, green-eyed college classmate who insists that she is not \"black\" but \"multiracial,\" Obama is scornful. \"That was the problem with people like Joyce,\" he writes. \"They talked about the richness of their multicultural heritage and it sounded real good, until you noticed that they avoided black people.\" Later in the memoir, Obama tells the story of falling in love with a white woman. During a visit to her family's country house, he found himself in the library, which was filled with pictures of the woman's illustrious relations. But instead of being in awe, Obama realized that he and the woman lived in different worlds. \"And I knew that if we stayed together, I'd eventually live in hers,\" he writes. \"Between the two of us, I was the one who knew how to live as an outsider.\"\n\nAfter college, Obama found a home, as well as a sense of himself, working on the South Side of Chicago as a community organizer. \"When I started doing that work, my story merges with a larger story. That happens naturally for a John Lewis,\" he told me, referring to the civil-rights hero and Democratic congressman. \"That happens more naturally for you. It was less obvious to me. How do I pull all these different strains together: Kenya and Hawaii and Kansas, and white and black and Asian-how does that fit? And through action, through work, I suddenly see myself as part of the bigger process for, yes, delivering justice for the [African American community] and specifically the South Side community, the low-income people-justice on behalf of the African American community. But also thereby promoting my ideas of justice and equality and empathy that my mother taught me were universal. So I'm in a position to understand those essential parts of me not as separate and apart from any particular community but connected to every community. And I can fit the African American struggle for freedom and justice in the context of the universal aspiration for freedom and justice.\"\n\nThroughout Obama's 2008 campaign and into his presidency, this attitude proved key to his deep support in the black community. African Americans, weary of high achievers who distanced themselves from their black roots, understood that Obama had paid a price for checking \"black\" on his census form, and for living black, for hosting Common, for brushing dirt off his shoulder during the primaries, for marrying a woman who looked like Michelle Obama. If women, as a gender, must suffer the constant evaluations and denigrations of men, black women must suffer that, plus a broad dismissal from the realm of what American society deems to be beautiful. But Michelle Obama is beautiful in the way that black people know themselves to be. Her prominence as first lady directly attacks a poison that diminishes black girls from the moment they are capable of opening a magazine or turning on a television.\n\nThe South Side of Chicago, where Obama began his political career, is home to arguably the most prominent and storied black political establishment in the country. In addition to Oscar Stanton De Priest, the first African American elected to Congress in the 20th century, the South Side produced the city's first black mayor, Harold Washington; Jesse Jackson, who twice ran for president; and Carol Moseley Braun, the first African American woman to win a Senate race. These victories helped give rise to Obama's own. Harold Washington served as an inspiration to Obama and looms heavily over the Chicago section of Dreams From My Father .\n\nWashington forged the kind of broad coalition that Obama would later assemble nationally. But Washington did this in the mid-1980s in segregated Chicago, and he had not had the luxury, as Obama did, of becoming black with minimal trauma. \"There was an edge to Harold that frightened some white voters,\" David Axelrod, who worked for both Washington and Obama, told me recently. Axelrod recalled sitting around a conference table with Washington after he had won the Democratic primary for his reelection in 1987, just as the mayor was about to hold a press conference. Washington asked what percentage of Chicago's white vote he'd received. \"And someone said, 'Well, you got 21 percent. And that's really good because last time' \"-in his successful 1983 mayoral campaign-\" 'you only got 8,' \" Axelrod recalled. \"And he kind of smiled, sadly, and said, 'You know, I probably spent 70 percent of my time in those white neighborhoods, and I think I've been a good mayor for everybody, and I got 21 percent of the white vote and we think it's good.' And he just kind of shook his head and said, 'Ain't it a bitch to be a black man in the land of the free and the home of the brave?'\n\n\"That was Harold. He felt those things. He had fought in an all-black unit in World War II. He had come up in times-and that and the sort of indignities of what you had to do to come up through the machine really seared him.\" During his 1983 mayoral campaign, Washington was loudly booed outside a church in northwest Chicago by middle-class Poles, Italians, and Irish, who feared blacks would uproot them. \"It was as vicious and ugly as anything you would have seen in the old South,\" Axelrod said.\n\nObama's ties to the South Side tradition that Washington represented were complicated. Like Washington, Obama attempted to forge a coalition between black South Siders and the broader community. But Obama, despite his adherence to black cultural mores, was, with his roots in Kansas and Hawaii, his Ivy League pedigree, and his ties to the University of Chicago, still an exotic out-of-towner. \"They were a bit skeptical of him,\" says Salim Muwakkil, a journalist who has covered Obama since before his days in the Illinois state Senate. \"Chicago is a very insular community, and he came from nowhere, seemingly.\"\n\nObama compounded people's suspicions by refusing to humble himself and go along with the political currents of the South Side. \"A lot of the politicians, especially the black ones, were just leery of him,\" Kaye Wilson, the godmother to Obama's children and one of the president's earliest political supporters, told me recently.\n\nBut even as many in the black political community were skeptical of Obama, others encouraged him-sometimes when they voted against him. When Obama lost the 2000 Democratic-primary race against Bobby Rush, the African American incumbent congressman representing Illinois' First Congressional District, the then-still-obscure future president experienced the defeat as having to do more with his age than his exoticism. \"I'd go meet people and I'd knock on doors and stuff, and some of the grandmothers who were the folks I'd been organizing and working with doing community stuff, they weren't parroting back some notion of 'You're too Harvard,' or 'You're too Hyde Park,' or what have you,\" Obama told me. \"They'd say, 'You're a wonderful young man, you're going to do great things. You just have to be patient.' So I didn't feel the loss as a rejection by black people. I felt the loss as 'politics anywhere is tough.' Politics in Chicago is especially tough. And being able to break through in the African American community is difficult because of the enormous loyalty that people feel towards anybody who has been around awhile.\"\n\nThere was no one around to compete for loyalty when Obama ran for Senate in 2004, or for president in 2008. He was no longer competing against other African Americans; he was representing them. \"He had that hybridity which told the 'do-gooders'-in Chicago they call the reformers the do-gooders-that he was acceptable,\" Muwakkil told me.\n\nObama ran for the Senate two decades after the death of Harold Washington. Axelrod checked in on the precinct where Washington had been so loudly booed by white Chicagoans. \"Obama carried, against seven candidates for the Senate, almost the entire northwest side and that precinct,\" he said. \"And I told him, 'Harold's smiling down on us tonight.' \"\n\nObama believes that his statewide victory for the Illinois Senate seat held particular portent for the events of 2008. \"Illinois is the most demographically representative state in the country,\" he told me. \"If you took all the percentages of black, white, Latino; rural, urban; agricultural, manufacturing-[if] you took that cross section across the country and you shrank it, it would be Illinois.\"\n\nIllinois effectively allowed Obama to play a scrimmage before the big national game in 2008. \"When I ran for the Senate I had to go into southern Illinois, downstate Illinois, farming communities-some with very tough racial histories, some areas where there just were no African Americans of any number,\" Obama told me. \"And when we won that race, not just an African American from Chicago, but an African American with an exotic history and [the] name Barack Hussein Obama, [it showed that I] could connect with and appeal to a much broader audience.\"\n\nThe mix of Obama's \"hybridity\" and the changing times allowed him to extend his appeal beyond the white ethnic corners of Chicago, past the downstate portions of Illinois, and out into the country at large. \"Ben Nelson, one of the most conservative Democrats in the Senate, from Nebraska, would only bring in one national Democrat to campaign for him,\" Obama recalls. \"And it was me. And so part of the reason I was willing to run [for president in 2008] was that I had had two years in which we were generating enormous crowds all across the country-and the majority of those crowds were not African American; and they were in pretty remote places, or unlikely places. They weren't just big cities or they weren't just liberal enclaves. So what that told me was, it was possible.\"\n\nWhat those crowds saw was a black candidate unlike any other before him. To simply point to Obama's white mother, or to his African father, or even to his rearing in Hawaii, is to miss the point. For most African Americans, white people exist either as a direct or an indirect force for bad in their lives. Biraciality is no shield against this; often it just intensifies the problem. What proved key for Barack Obama was not that he was born to a black man and a white woman, but that his white family approved of the union, and approved of the child who came from it. They did this in 1961-a time when sex between black men and white women, in large swaths of the country, was not just illegal but fraught with mortal danger. But that danger is not part of Obama's story. The first white people he ever knew, the ones who raised him, were decent in a way that very few black people of that era experienced.\n\nI asked Obama what he made of his grandparents' impressively civilized reception of his father. \"It wasn't Harry Belafonte,\" Obama said laughingly of his father. \"This was like an African African. And he was like a blue-black brother. Nilotic. And so, yeah, I will always give my grandparents credit for that. I'm not saying they were happy about it. I'm not saying that they were not, after the guy leaves, looking at each other like, 'What the heck?' But whatever misgivings they had, they never expressed to me, never spilled over into how they interacted with me.\n\n\"Now, part of it, as I say in my book, was we were in this unique environment in Hawaii where I think it was much easier. I don't know if it would have been as easy for them if they were living in Chicago at the time, because the lines just weren't as sharply drawn in Hawaii as they were on the mainland.\"\n\nObama's early positive interactions with his white family members gave him a fundamentally different outlook toward the wider world than most blacks of the 1960s had. Obama told me he rarely had \"the working assumption of discrimination, the working assumption that white people would not treat me right or give me an opportunity or judge me [other than] on the basis of merit.\" He continued, \"The kind of working assumption\" that white people would discriminate against him or treat him poorly \"is less embedded in my psyche than it is, say, with Michelle.\"\n\nIn this, the first lady is more representative of black America than her husband is. African Americans typically raise their children to protect themselves against a presumed hostility from white teachers, white police officers, white supervisors, and white co-workers. The need for that defense is, more often than not, reinforced either directly by actual encounters or indirectly by observing the vast differences between one's own experience and those across the color line. Marty Nesbitt, the president's longtime best friend, who, like Obama, had positive interactions with whites at a relatively early age, told me that when he and his wife went to buy their first car, she was insistent on buying from a black salesperson. \"I'm like, 'We've got to find a salesman,' \" Nesbitt said. \"She's like, 'No, no, no. We're waiting for the brother.' And I'm like, 'He's with a customer.' They were filling out documents and she was like, 'We're going to stay around.' And a white guy came up to us. 'Can I help you?' 'Nope.' \" Nesbitt was not out to condemn anyone with this story. He was asserting that \"the willingness of African Americans [in Chicago] to help lift each other up is powerful.\"\n\nBut that willingness to help is also a defense, produced by decades of discrimination. Obama sees race through a different lens, Kaye Wilson told me. \"It's just very different from ours,\" she explained. \"He's got buddies that are white, and they're his buddies, and they love him. And I don't think they love him just because he's the president. They love him because they're his friends from Hawaii, some from college and all.\n\n\"So I think he's got that, whereas I think growing up in the racist United States, we enter this thing with, you know, 'I'm looking at you. I'm not trusting you to be one hundred with me.' And I think he grew up in a way that he had to trust [white people]-how can you live under the roof with people and think that they don't love you? He needs that frame of reference. He needs that lens. If he didn't have it, it would be ... a Jesse Jackson, you know? Or Al Sharpton. Different lens.\"\n\nThat lens, born of literally relating to whites, allowed Obama to imagine that he could be the country's first black president. \"If I walked into a room and it's a bunch of white farmers, trade unionists, middle age-I'm not walking in thinking, Man, I've got to show them that I'm normal ,\" Obama explained. \"I walk in there, I think, with a set of assumptions: like, these people look just like my grandparents. And I see the same Jell‐O mold that my grandmother served, and they've got the same, you know, little stuff on their mantelpieces. And so I am maybe disarming them by just assuming that we're okay.\"\n\nWhat Obama was able to offer white America is something very few African Americans could-trust. The vast majority of us are, necessarily, too crippled by our defenses to ever consider such a proposition. But Obama, through a mixture of ancestral connections and distance from the poisons of Jim Crow, can credibly and sincerely trust the majority population of this country. That trust is reinforced, not contradicted, by his blackness. Obama isn't shuffling before white power (Herman Cain's \"shucky ducky\" act) or flattering white ego (O. J. Simpson's listing not being seen as black as a great accomplishment). That, too, is defensive, and deep down, I suspect, white people know it. He stands firm in his own cultural traditions and says to the country something virtually no black person can, but every president must: \"I believe you.\"\n\nJust after Columbus Day , I accompanied the president and his formidable entourage on a visit to North Carolina A&T State University, in Greensboro. Four days earlier, The Washington Post had published an old audio clip that featured Donald Trump lamenting a failed sexual conquest and exhorting the virtues of sexual assault. The next day, Trump claimed that this was \"locker room\" talk. As we flew to North Carolina, the president was in a state of bemused disbelief. He plopped down in a chair in the staff cabin of Air Force One and said, \"I've been in a lot of locker rooms. I don't think I've ever heard that one before.\" He was casual and relaxed. A feeling of cautious inevitability emanated from his staff, and why not? Every day seemed to bring a new, more shocking revelation or piece of evidence showing Trump to be unfit for the presidency: He had lost nearly $1 billion in a single year. He had likely not paid taxes in 18 years. He was running a \"university,\" for which he was under formal legal investigation. He had trampled on his own campaign's messaging by engaging in a Twitter crusade against a former beauty-pageant contestant. He had been denounced by leadership in his own party, and the trickle of prominent Republicans-both in and out of office-who had publicly repudiated him threatened to become a geyser. At this moment, the idea that a campaign so saturated in open bigotry, misogyny, chaos, and possible corruption could win a national election was ludicrous. This was America.\n\nThe president was going to North Carolina to keynote a campaign rally for Clinton, but first he was scheduled for a conversation about My Brother's Keeper, his initiative on behalf of disadvantaged youth. Announcing My Brother's Keeper-or MBK, as it's come to be called-in 2014, the president had sought to avoid giving the program a partisan valence, noting that it was \"not some big new government program.\" Instead, it would involve the government in concert with the nonprofit and business sectors to intervene in the lives of young men of color who were \"at risk.\" MBK serves as a kind of network for those elements of federal, state, and local government that might already have a presence in the lives of these young men. It is a quintessentially Obama program-conservative in scope, with impacts that are measurable.\n\n\"It comes right out of his own life,\" Broderick Johnson, the Cabinet secretary and an assistant to the president, who heads MBK, told me recently. \"I have heard him say, 'I don't want us to have a bunch of forums on race.' He reminds people, 'Yeah, we can talk about this. But what are we going to do ?' \" On this afternoon in North Carolina, what Obama did was sit with a group of young men who'd turned their lives around in part because of MBK. They told stories of being in the street, of choosing quick money over school, of their homes being shot up, and-through the help of mentoring or job programs brokered by MBK-transitioning into college or a job. Obama listened solemnly and empathetically to each of them. \"It doesn't take that much,\" he told them. \"It just takes someone laying hands on you and saying, 'Hey, man, you count.' \"\n\nWhen he asked the young men whether they had a message he should take back to policy makers in Washington, D.C., one observed that despite their best individual efforts, they still had to go back to the very same deprived neighborhoods that had been the sources of trouble for them. \"It's your environment,\" the young man said. \"You can do what you want, but you still gotta go back to the hood.\"\n\nHe was correct. The ghettos of America are the direct result of decades of public-policy decisions: the redlining of real-estate zoning maps, the expanded authority given to prosecutors, the increased funding given to prisons. And all of this was done on the backs of people still reeling from the 250-year legacy of slavery. The results of this negative investment are clear-African Americans rank at the bottom of nearly every major socioeconomic measure in the country.\n\nObama's formula for closing this chasm between black and white America, like that of many progressive politicians today, proceeded from policy designed for all of America. Blacks disproportionately benefit from this effort, since they are disproportionately in need. The Affordable Care Act, which cut the uninsured rate in the black community by at least a third, was Obama's most prominent example. Its full benefit has yet to be felt by African Americans, because several states in the South have declined to expand Medicaid. But when the president and I were meeting, the ACA's advocates believed that pressure on state budgets would force expansion, and there was evidence to support this: Louisiana had expanded Medicaid earlier in 2016, and advocates were gearing up for wars to be waged in Georgia and Virginia.\n\nObama also emphasized the need for a strong Justice Department with a deep commitment to nondiscrimination. When Obama moved into the White House in 2009, the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division \"was in shambles,\" former Attorney General Eric Holder told me recently. \"I mean, I had been there for 12 years as a line guy. I started out in '76, so I served under Republicans and Democrats. And what the [George W.] Bush administration, what the Bush DOJ did, was unlike anything that had ever happened before in terms of politicized hiring.\" The career civil servants below the political appointees, Holder said, were not even invited to the meetings in which the key hiring and policy decisions were made. After Obama's inauguration, Holder told me, \"I remember going to tell all the folks at the Civil Rights Division, 'The Civil Rights Division is open for business again.' The president gave me additional funds to hire people.\"\n\nThe political press developed a narrative that because Obama felt he had to modulate his rhetoric on race, Holder was the administration's true, and thus blacker, conscience. Holder is certainly blunter, and this worried some of the White House staff. Early in Obama's first term, Holder gave a speech on race in which he said the United States had been a \"nation of cowards\" on the subject. But positioning the two men as opposites elides an important fact: Holder was appointed by the president, and went only as far as the president allowed. I asked Holder whether he had toned down his rhetoric after that controversial speech. \"Nope,\" he said. Reflecting on his relationship with the president, Holder said, \"We were also kind of different people, you know? He is the Zen guy. And I'm kind of the hot-blooded West Indian. And I thought we made a good team, but there's nothing that I ever did or said that I don't think he would have said, 'I support him 100 percent.'\n\n\"Now, the 'nation of cowards' speech, the president might have used a different phrase-maybe, probably. But he and I share a worldview, you know? And when I hear people say, 'Well, you are blacker than him' or something like that, I think, What are you all talking about? \"\n\nFor much of his presidency, a standard portion of Obama's speeches about race riffed on black people's need to turn off the television, stop eating junk food, and stop blaming white people for their problems. Obama would deliver this lecture to any black audience, regardless of context. It was bizarre, for instance, to see the president warning young men who'd just graduated from Morehouse College, one of the most storied black colleges in the country, about making \"excuses\" and blaming whites.\n\nThis part of the Obama formula is the most troubling, and least thought-out. This judgment emerges from my own biography. I am the product of black parents who encouraged me to read, of black teachers who felt my work ethic did not match my potential, of black college professors who taught me intellectual rigor. And they did this in a world that every day insulted their humanity. It was not so much that the black layabouts and deadbeats Obama invoked in his speeches were unrecognizable. I had seen those people too. But I'd also seen the same among white people. If black men were overrepresented among drug dealers and absentee dads of the world, it was directly related to their being underrepresented among the Bernie Madoffs and Kenneth Lays of the world. Power was what mattered, and what characterized the differences between black and white America was not a difference in work ethic, but a system engineered to place one on top of the other.\n\nThe mark of that system is visible at every level of American society, regardless of the quality of one's choices. For instance, the unemployment rate among black college graduates (4.1 percent) is almost the same as the unemployment rate among white high-school graduates (4.6 percent). But that college degree is generally purchased at a higher price by blacks than by whites. According to research by the Brookings Institution, African Americans tend to carry more student debt four years after graduation ($53,000 versus $28,000) and suffer from a higher default rate on their loans (7.6 percent versus 2.4 percent) than white Americans. This is both the result and the perpetuator of a sprawling wealth gap between the races. White households, on average, hold seven times as much wealth as black households-a difference so large as to make comparing the \"black middle class\" and \"white middle class\" meaningless; they're simply not comparable. According to Patrick Sharkey, a sociologist at New York University who studies economic mobility, black families making $100,000 a year or more live in more-disadvantaged neighborhoods than white families making less than $30,000. This gap didn't just appear by magic; it's the result of the government's effort over many decades to create a pigmentocracy-one that will continue without explicit intervention.\n\nObama had been on the record as opposing reparations. But now, late in his presidency, he seemed more open to the idea-in theory, at least, if not in practice.\n\n\"Theoretically, you can make obviously a powerful argument that centuries of slavery, Jim Crow, discrimination are the primary cause for all those gaps,\" Obama said, referencing the gulf in education, wealth, and employment that separates black and white America. \"That those were wrongs to the black community as a whole, and black families specifically, and that in order to close that gap, a society has a moral obligation to make a large, aggressive investment, even if it's not in the form of individual reparations checks but in the form of a Marshall Plan.\"\n\nThe political problems with turning the argument for reparations into reality are manifold, Obama said. \"If you look at countries like South Africa, where you had a black majority, there have been efforts to tax and help that black majority, but it hasn't come in the form of a formal reparations program. You have countries like India that have tried to help untouchables, with essentially affirmative-action programs, but it hasn't fundamentally changed the structure of their societies. So the bottom line is that it's hard to find a model in which you can practically administer and sustain political support for those kinds of efforts.\"\n\nObama went on to say that it would be better, and more realistic, to get the country to rally behind a robust liberal agenda and build on the enormous progress that's been made toward getting white Americans to accept nondiscrimination as a basic operating premise. But the progress toward nondiscrimination did not appear overnight. It was achieved by people willing to make an unpopular argument and live on the frontier of public opinion. I asked him whether it wasn't-despite the practical obstacles-worth arguing that the state has a collective responsibility not only for its achievements but for its sins.\n\n\"I want my children-I want Malia and Sasha-to understand that they've got responsibilities beyond just what they themselves have done,\" Obama said. \"That they have a responsibility to the larger community and the larger nation, that they should be sensitive to and extra thoughtful about the plight of people who have been oppressed in the past, are oppressed currently. So that's a wisdom that I want to transmit to my kids ... But I would say that's a high level of enlightenment that you're looking to have from a majority of the society. And it may be something that future generations are more open to, but I am pretty confident that for the foreseeable future, using the argument of nondiscrimination, and 'Let's get it right for the kids who are here right now,' and giving them the best chance possible, is going to be a more persuasive argument.\"\n\nObama is unfailingly optimistic about the empathy and capabilities of the American people. His job necessitates this: \"At some level what the people want to feel is that the person leading them sees the best in them,\" he told me. But I found it interesting that that optimism does not extend to the possibility of the public's accepting wisdoms-such as the moral logic of reparations-that the president, by his own account, has accepted for himself and is willing to teach his children. Obama says he always tells his staff that \"better is good.\" The notion that a president would attempt to achieve change within the boundaries of the accepted consensus is appropriate. But Obama is almost constitutionally skeptical of those who seek to achieve change outside that consensus.\n\nEarly in 2016, Obama invited a group of African American leaders to meet with him at the White House. When some of the activists affiliated with Black Lives Matter refused to attend, Obama began calling them out in speeches. \"You can't refuse to meet because that might compromise the purity of your position,\" he said. \"The value of social movements and activism is to get you at the table, get you in the room, and then start trying to figure out how is this problem going to be solved. You then have a responsibility to prepare an agenda that is achievable-that can institutionalize the changes you seek-and to engage the other side.\"\n\nOpal Tometi, a Nigerian American community activist who is one of the three founders of Black Lives Matter, explained to me that the group has a more diffuse structure than most civil-rights organizations. One reason for this is to avoid the cult of personality that has plagued black organizations in the past. So the founders asked its membership in Chicago, the president's hometown, whether they should meet with Obama. \"They felt-and I think many of our members felt-there wouldn't be the depth of discussion that they wanted to have,\" Tometi told me. \"And if there wasn't that space to have a real heart-to-heart, and if it was just surface level, that it would be more of a disservice to the movement.\"\n\nTometi noted that some other activists allied with Black Lives Matter had been planning to attend the meeting, so they felt their views would be represented. Nevertheless, Black Lives Matter sees itself as engaged in a protest against the treatment of black people by the American state, and so Tometi and much of the group's leadership, concerned about being used for a photo op by the very body they were protesting, opted not to go.\n\nWhen I asked Obama about this perspective, he fluctuated between understanding where the activists were coming from and being hurt by such brush-offs. \"I think that where I've gotten frustrated during the course of my presidency has never been because I was getting pushed too hard by activists to see the justness of a cause or the essence of an issue,\" he said. \"I think where I got frustrated at times was the belief that the president can do anything if he just decides he wants to do it. And that sort of lack of awareness on the part of an activist about the constraints of our political system and the constraints on this office, I think, sometimes would leave me to mutter under my breath. Very rarely did I lose it publicly. Usually I'd just smile.\"\n\nHe laughed, then continued, \"The reason I say that is because those are the times where sometimes you feel actually a little bit hurt. Because you feel like saying to these folks, '[Don't] you think if I could do it, I [would] have just done it? Do you think that the only problem is that I don't care enough about the plight of poor people, or gay people?' \"\n\nI asked Obama whether he thought that perhaps protesters' distrust of the powers that be could ultimately be healthy. \"Yes,\" he said. \"Which is why I don't get too hurt. I mean, I think there is a benefit to wanting to hold power's feet to the fire until you actually see the goods. I get that. And I think it is important. And frankly, sometimes it's useful for activists just to be out there to keep you mindful and not get complacent, even if ultimately you think some of their criticism is misguided.\"\n\nObama himself was an activist and a community organizer, albeit for only two years-but he is not, by temperament, a protester. He is a consensus-builder; consensus, he believes, ultimately drives what gets done. He understands the emotional power of protest, the need to vent before authority-but that kind of approach does not come naturally to him. Regarding reparations, he said, \"Sometimes I wonder how much of these debates have to do with the desire, the legitimate desire, for that history to be recognized. Because there is a psychic power to the recognition that is not satisfied with a universal program; it's not satisfied by the Affordable Care Act, or an expansion of Pell Grants, or an expansion of the earned-income tax credit.\" These kinds of programs, effective and disproportionately beneficial to black people though they may be, don't \"speak to the hurt, and the sense of injustice, and the self-doubt that arises out of the fact that [African Americans] are behind now, and it makes us sometimes feel as if there must be something wrong with us-unless you're able to see the history and say, 'It's amazing we got this far given what we went through.'\n\n\"So in part, I think the argument sometimes that I've had with folks who are much more interested in sort of race-specific programs is less an argument about what is practically achievable and sometimes maybe more an argument of 'We want society to see what's happened and internalize it and answer it in demonstrable ways.' And those impulses I very much understand-but my hope would be that as we're moving through the world right now, we're able to get that psychological or emotional peace by seeing very concretely our kids doing better and being more hopeful and having greater opportunities.\"\n\nObama saw-at least at that moment, before the election of Donald Trump-a straight path to that world. \"Just play this out as a thought experiment,\" he said. \"Imagine if you had genuine, high-quality early-childhood education for every child, and suddenly every black child in America-but also every poor white child or Latino [child], but just stick with every black child in America-is getting a really good education. And they're graduating from high school at the same rates that whites are, and they are going to college at the same rates that whites are, and they are able to afford college at the same rates because the government has universal programs that say that you're not going to be barred from school just because of how much money your parents have.\n\n\"So now they're all graduating. And let's also say that the Justice Department and the courts are making sure, as I've said in a speech before, that when Jamal sends his résumé in, he's getting treated the same as when Johnny sends his résumé in. Now, are we going to have suddenly the same number of CEOs, billionaires, etc., as the white community? In 10 years? Probably not, maybe not even in 20 years.\n\n\"But I guarantee you that we would be thriving, we would be succeeding. We wouldn't have huge numbers of young African American men in jail. We'd have more family formation as college-graduated girls are meeting boys who are their peers, which then in turn means the next generation of kids are growing up that much better. And suddenly you've got a whole generation that's in a position to start using the incredible creativity that we see in music, and sports, and frankly even on the streets, channeled into starting all kinds of businesses. I feel pretty good about our odds in that situation.\"\n\nThe thought experiment doesn't hold up. The programs Obama favored would advance white America too-and without a specific commitment to equality, there is no guarantee that the programs would eschew discrimination. Obama's solution relies on a goodwill that his own personal history tells him exists in the larger country. My own history tells me something different. The large numbers of black men in jail, for instance, are not just the result of poor policy, but of not seeing those men as human.\n\nWhen President Obama and I had this conversation, the target he was aiming to reach seemed to me to be many generations away, and now-as President-Elect Trump prepares for office-seems even many more generations off. Obama's accomplishments were real: a $1 billion settlement on behalf of black farmers, a Justice Department that exposed Ferguson's municipal plunder, the increased availability of Pell Grants (and their availability to some prisoners), and the slashing of the crack/cocaine disparity in sentencing guidelines, to name just a few. Obama was also the first sitting president to visit a federal prison. There was a feeling that he'd erected a foundation upon which further progressive policy could be built. It's tempting to say that foundation is now endangered. The truth is, it was never safe.\n\nObama's greatest misstep was born directly out of his greatest insight. Only Obama, a black man who emerged from the best of white America, and thus could sincerely trust white America, could be so certain that he could achieve broad national appeal. And yet only a black man with that same biography could underestimate his opposition's resolve to destroy him. In some sense an Obama presidency could never have succeeded along the normal presidential lines; he needed a partner, or partners, in Congress who could put governance above party. But he struggled to win over even some of his own allies. Ben Nelson, the Democratic senator from Nebraska whom Obama helped elect, became an obstacle to health-care reform. Joe Lieberman, whom Obama saved from retribution at the hands of Senate Democrats after Lieberman campaigned for Obama's 2008 opponent, John McCain, similarly obstructed Obamacare. Among Republicans, senators who had seemed amenable to Obama's agenda-Chuck Grassley, Susan Collins, Richard Lugar, Olympia Snowe-rebuffed him repeatedly.\n\nThe obstruction grew out of narrow political incentives. \"If Republicans didn't cooperate,\" Obama told me, \"and there was not a portrait of bipartisan cooperation and a functional federal government, then the party in power would pay the price and they could win back the Senate and/or the House. That wasn't an inaccurate political calculation.\"\n\nObama is not sure of the degree to which individual racism played into this calculation. \"I do remember watching Bill Clinton get impeached and Hillary Clinton being accused of killing Vince Foster,\" he said. \"And if you ask them, I'm sure they would say, 'No, actually what you're experiencing is not because you're black, it's because you're a Democrat.' \"\n\nBut personal animus is just one manifestation of racism; arguably the more profound animosity occurs at the level of interests. The most recent Congress boasted 138 members from the states that comprised the old Confederacy. Of the 101 Republicans in that group, 96 are white and one is black. Of the 37 Democrats, 18 are black and 15 are white. There are no white congressional Democrats in the Deep South. Exit polls in Mississippi in 2008 found that 96 percent of voters who described themselves as Republicans were white. The Republican Party is not simply the party of whites, but the preferred party of whites who identify their interest as defending the historical privileges of whiteness. The researchers Josh Pasek, Jon A. Krosnick, and Trevor Tompson found that in 2012, 32 percent of Democrats held antiblack views, while 79 percent of Republicans did. These attitudes could even spill over to white Democratic politicians, because they are seen as representing the party of blacks. Studying the 2016 election, the political scientist Philip Klinkner found that the most predictive question for understanding whether a voter favored Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump was \"Is Barack Obama a Muslim?\"\n\nIn our conversations, Obama said he didn't doubt that there was a sincerely nonracist states'-rights contingent of the GOP. And yet he suspected that there might be more to it. \"A rudimentary knowledge of American history tells you that the relationship between the federal government and the states was very much mixed up with attitudes towards slavery, attitudes towards Jim Crow, attitudes towards antipoverty programs and who benefited and who didn't,\" he said.\n\n\"And so I'm careful not to attribute any particular resistance or slight or opposition to race. But what I do believe is that if somebody didn't have a problem with their daddy being employed by the federal government, and didn't have a problem with the Tennessee Valley Authority electrifying certain communities, and didn't have a problem with the interstate highway system being built, and didn't have a problem with the GI Bill, and didn't have a problem with the [Federal Housing Administration] subsidizing the suburbanization of America, and that all helped you build wealth and create a middle class-and then suddenly as soon as African Americans or Latinos are interested in availing themselves of those same mechanisms as ladders into the middle class, you now have a violent opposition to them-then I think you at least have to ask yourself the question of how consistent you are, and what's different, and what's changed.\"\n\nRacism greeted Obama in both his primary and general-election campaigns in 2008. Photos were circulated of him in Somali garb. Rush Limbaugh dubbed him \"Barack the Magic Negro.\" Roger Stone, who would go on to advise the Trump campaign, claimed that Michelle Obama could be heard on tape yelling \"Whitey.\" Detractors circulated emails claiming that the future first lady had written a racist senior thesis while at Princeton. A fifth of all West Virginia Democratic-primary voters in 2008 openly admitted that race had influenced their vote. Hillary Clinton trounced him 67 to 26 percent.\n\nAfter Obama won the presidency in defiance of these racial headwinds, traffic to the white-supremacist website Stormfront increased sixfold. Before the election, in August, just before the Democratic National Convention, the FBI uncovered an assassination plot hatched by white supremacists in Denver. Mainstream conservative publications floated the notion that Obama's memoir was too \"stylish and penetrating\" to have been written by the candidate, and found a plausible ghostwriter in the radical (and white) former Weatherman Bill Ayers. A Republican women's club in California dispensed \"Obama Bucks\" featuring slices of watermelon, ribs, and fried chicken. At the Values Voter Summit that year, conventioneers hawked \"Obama Waffles,\" a waffle mix whose box featured a bug-eyed caricature of the candidate. Fake hip-hop lyrics were scrawled on the side (\"Barry's Bling Bling Waffle Ring\") and on the top, the same caricature was granted a turban and tagged with the instructions \"Point box toward Mecca for tastier waffles.\" The display was denounced by the summit's sponsor, the Family Research Council. One would be forgiven for meeting this denunciation with guffaws: The council's president, Tony Perkins, had once addressed the white-supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens with a Confederate flag draped behind him. By 2015, Perkins had deemed the debate over Obama's birth certificate \"legitimate\" and was saying that it \"makes sense\" to conclude that Obama was actually a Muslim.\n\nBy then, birtherism-inflamed in large part by a real-estate mogul and reality-TV star named Donald Trump-had overtaken the Republican rank and file. In 2015, one poll found that 54 percent of GOP voters thought Obama was a Muslim. Only 29 percent believed he'd been born in America.\n\nStill, in 2008, Obama had been elected. His supporters rejoiced. As Jay-Z commemorated the occasion:\n\nNot quite. A month after Obama entered the White House, a CNBC personality named Rick Santelli took to the trading floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and denounced the president's efforts to help homeowners endangered by the housing crisis. \"How many of you people want to pay for your neighbor's mortgage that has an extra bathroom and can't pay their bills?,\" Santelli asked the assembled traders. He asserted that Obama should \"reward people that could carry the water\" as opposed to those who \"drink the water,\" and denounced those in danger of foreclosure as \"losers.\" Race was implicit in Santelli's harangue-the housing crisis and predatory lending had devastated black communities and expanded the wealth gap-and it culminated with a call for a \"Tea Party\" to resist the Obama presidency. In fact, right-wing ideologues had been planning just such a resistance for decades. They would eagerly answer Santelli's call.\n\nOne of the intellectual forerunners of the Tea Party is said to be Ron Paul, the heterodox two-time Republican presidential candidate, who opposed the war in Iraq and championed civil liberties. On other matters, Paul was more traditional. Throughout the '90s, he published a series of racist newsletters that referred to New York City as \"Welfaria,\" called Martin Luther King Jr. Day \"Hate Whitey Day,\" and asserted that 95 percent of black males in Washington, D.C., were either \"semi-criminal or entirely criminal.\" Paul's apologists have claimed that he had no real connection to the newsletters, even though virtually all of them were published in his name (\"The Ron Paul Survival Report,\" \"Ron Paul Political Report,\" \"Dr. Ron Paul's Freedom Report\") and written in his voice. Either way, the views of the newsletters have found their expression in his ideological comrades. Throughout Obama's first term, Tea Party activists voiced their complaints in racist terms. Activists brandished signs warning that Obama would implement \"white slavery,\" waved the Confederate flag, depicted Obama as a witch doctor, and issued calls for him to \"go back to Kenya.\" Tea Party supporters wrote \"satirical\" letters in the name of \"We Colored People\" and stoked the flames of birtherism. One of the Tea Party's most prominent sympathizers, the radio host Laura Ingraham, wrote a racist tract depicting Michelle Obama gorging herself on ribs, while Glenn Beck said the president was a \"racist\" with a \"deep-seated hatred for white people.\" The Tea Party's leading exponent, Andrew Breitbart, engineered the smearing of Shirley Sherrod, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's director of rural development for Georgia, publishing egregiously misleading videos that wrongly made her appear to be engaging in antiwhite racist invective, which led to her dismissal. (In a rare act of cowardice, the Obama administration cravenly submitted to this effort.)\n\nIn those rare moments when Obama made any sort of comment attacking racism, firestorms threatened to consume his governing agenda. When, in July 2009, the president objected to the arrest of the eminent Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. while he was trying to get into his own house, pointing out that the officer had \"acted stupidly,\" a third of whites said the remark made them feel less favorably toward the president, and nearly two-thirds claimed that Obama had \"acted stupidly\" by commenting. A chastened Obama then determined to make sure his public statements on race were no longer mere riffs but designed to have an achievable effect. This was smart, but still the invective came. During Obama's 2009 address on health care before a joint session of Congress, Joe Wilson, a Republican congressman from South Carolina, incredibly, and in defiance of precedent and decorum, disrupted the proceedings by crying out \"You lie!\" A Missouri congressman equated Obama with a monkey. A California GOP official took up the theme and emailed her friends an image depicting Obama as a chimp, with the accompanying text explaining, \"Now you know why [there's] no birth certificate!\" Former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin assessed the president's foreign policy as a \"shuck and jive shtick.\" Newt Gingrich dubbed him the \"food-stamp president.\" The rhetorical attacks on Obama were matched by a very real attack on his political base-in 2011 and 2012, 19 states enacted voting restrictions that made it harder for African Americans to vote.\n\nYet in 2012, as in 2008, Obama won anyway. Prior to the election, Obama, ever the optimist, had claimed that intransigent Republicans would decide to work with him to advance the country. No such collaboration was in the offing. Instead, legislation ground to a halt and familiar themes resurfaced. An Idaho GOP official posted a photo on Facebook depicting a trap waiting for Obama. The bait was a slice of watermelon. The caption read, \"Breaking: The secret service just uncovered a plot to kidnap the president. More details as we get them ...\" In 2014, conservatives assembled in support of Cliven Bundy's armed protest against federal grazing fees. As reporters descended on the Bundy ranch in Nevada, Bundy offered his opinions on \"the Negro.\" \"They abort their young children, they put their young men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton,\" Bundy explained. \"And I've often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy? They didn't get no more freedom. They got less freedom.\"\n\nThat same year, in the wake of Michael Brown's death, the Justice Department opened an investigation into the police department in Ferguson, Missouri. It found a city that, through racial profiling, arbitrary fines, and wanton harassment, had exploited law enforcement for the purposes of municipal plunder. The plunder was sanctified by racist humor dispensed via internal emails among the police that later came to light. The president of the United States, who during his first year in office had reportedly received three times the number of death threats of any of his predecessors, was a repeat target.\n\nMuch ink has been spilled in an attempt to understand the Tea Party protests, and the 2016 presidential candidacy of Donald Trump, which ultimately emerged out of them. One theory popular among (primarily) white intellectuals of varying political persuasions held that this response was largely the discontented rumblings of a white working class threatened by the menace of globalization and crony capitalism. Dismissing these rumblings as racism was said to condescend to this proletariat, which had long suffered the slings and arrows of coastal elites, heartless technocrats, and reformist snobs. Racism was not something to be coolly and empirically assessed but a slander upon the working man. Deindustrialization, globalization, and broad income inequality are real. And they have landed with at least as great a force upon black and Latino people in our country as upon white people. And yet these groups were strangely unrepresented in this new populism.\n\nChristopher S. Parker and Matt A. Barreto, political scientists at the University of Washington and UCLA, respectively, have found a relatively strong relationship between racism and Tea Party membership. \"Whites are less likely to be drawn to the Tea Party for material reasons, suggesting that, relative to other groups, it's really more about social prestige,\" they say. The notion that the Tea Party represented the righteous, if unfocused, anger of an aggrieved class allowed everyone from leftists to neoliberals to white nationalists to avoid a horrifying and simple reality: A significant swath of this country did not like the fact that their president was black, and that swath was not composed of those most damaged by an unquestioned faith in the markets. Far better to imagine the grievance put upon the president as the ghost of shambling factories and defunct union halls, as opposed to what it really was-a movement inaugurated by ardent and frightened white capitalists, raging from the commodities-trading floor of one of the great financial centers of the world.\n\nThat movement came into full bloom in the summer of 2015, with the candidacy of Donald Trump, a man who'd risen to political prominence by peddling the racist myth that the president was not American. It was birtherism-not trade, not jobs, not isolationism-that launched Trump's foray into electoral politics. Having risen unexpectedly on this basis into the stratosphere of Republican politics, Trump spent the campaign freely and liberally trafficking in misogyny, Islamophobia, and xenophobia. And on November 8, 2016, he won election to the presidency. Historians will spend the next century analyzing how a country with such allegedly grand democratic traditions was, so swiftly and so easily, brought to the brink of fascism. But one needn't stretch too far to conclude that an eight-year campaign of consistent and open racism aimed at the leader of the free world helped clear the way.\n\n\"They rode the tiger. And now the tiger is eating them,\" David Axelrod, speaking of the Republican Party, told me. That was in October. His words proved too optimistic. The tiger would devour us all.\n\nOne Saturday morning last May, I joined the presidential motorcade as it slipped out of the southern gate of the White House. A mostly white crowd had assembled. As the motorcade drove by, people cheered, held up their smartphones to record the procession, and waved American flags. To be within feet of the president seemed like the thrill of their lives. I was astounded. An old euphoria, which I could not immediately place, gathered up in me. And then I remembered, it was what I felt through much of 2008, as I watched Barack Obama's star shoot across the political sky. I had never seen so many white people cheer on a black man who was neither an athlete nor an entertainer. And it seemed that they loved him for this, and I thought in those days, which now feel so long ago, that they might then love me, too, and love my wife, and love my child, and love us all in the manner that the God they so fervently cited had commanded. I had been raised amid a people who wanted badly to believe in the possibility of a Barack Obama, even as their very lives argued against that possibility. So they would praise Martin Luther King Jr. in one breath and curse the white man, \"the Great Deceiver,\" in the next. Then came Obama and the Obama family, and they were black and beautiful in all the ways we aspired to be, and all that love was showered upon them. But as Obama's motorcade approached its destination-Howard University, where he would give the commencement address-the complexion of the crowd darkened, and I understood that the love was specific, that even if it allowed Barack Obama, even if it allowed the luckiest of us, to defy the boundaries, then the masses of us, in cities like this one, would still enjoy no such feat.\n\nThese were our fitful, spasmodic years.\n\nWe were launched into the Obama era with no notion of what to expect, if only because a black presidency had seemed such a dubious proposition. There was no preparation, because it would have meant preparing for the impossible. There were few assessments of its potential import, because such assessments were regarded as speculative fiction. In retrospect it all makes sense, and one can see a jagged but real political lineage running through black Chicago. It originates in Oscar Stanton De Priest; continues through Congressman William Dawson, who, under Roosevelt, switched from the Republican to the Democratic Party; crescendos with the legendary Harold Washington; rises still with Jesse Jackson's 1988 victory in Michigan's Democratic caucuses; rises again with Carol Moseley Braun's triumph; and reaches its recent apex with the election of Barack Obama. If the lineage is apparent in hindsight, so are the limits of presidential power. For a century after emancipation, quasi-slavery haunted the South. And more than half a century after Brown v. Board of Education , schools throughout much of this country remain segregated.\n\nThere are no clean victories for black people, nor, perhaps, for any people. The presidency of Barack Obama is no different. One can now say that an African American individual can rise to the same level as a white individual, and yet also say that the number of black individuals who actually qualify for that status will be small. One thinks of Serena Williams, whose dominance and stunning achievements can't, in and of themselves, ensure equal access to tennis facilities for young black girls. The gate is open and yet so very far away.\n\nI felt a mix of pride and amazement walking onto Howard's campus that day. Howard alumni, of which I am one, are an obnoxious fraternity, known for yelling the school chant across city blocks, sneering at other historically black colleges and universities, and condescending to black graduates of predominantly white institutions. I like to think I am more reserved, but I felt an immense satisfaction in being in the library where I had once found my history, and now found myself with the first black president of the United States. It seemed providential that he would give the commencement address here in his last year. The same pride I felt radiated out across the Yard, the large green patch in the main area of the campus where the ceremony would take place. When Obama walked out, the audience exploded, and when the time came for the color guard to present arms, a chant arose: \"O-Ba-Ma! O-Ba-Ma! O-Ba-Ma!\"\n\nHe gave a good speech that day, paying heed to Howard's rituals, calling out its famous alumni, shouting out the university's various dormitories, and urging young people to vote. (His usual riff on respectability politics was missing.) But I think he could have stood before that crowd, smiled, and said \"Good luck,\" and they would have loved him anyway. He was their champion, and this was evident in the smallest of things. The national anthem was played first, but then came the black national anthem, \"Lift Every Voice and Sing.\" As the lyrics rang out over the crowd, the students held up the black-power fist-a symbol of defiance before power. And yet here, in the face of a black man in his last year in power, it scanned not as a protest, but as a salute.\n\nSix months later the awful price of a black presidency would be known to those students, even as the country seemed determined not to acknowledge it. In the days after Donald Trump's victory, there would be an insistence that something as \"simple\" as racism could not explain it. As if enslavement had nothing to do with global economics, or as if lynchings said nothing about the idea of women as property. As though the past 400 years could be reduced to the irrational resentment of full lips. No. Racism is never simple. And there was nothing simple about what was coming, or about Obama, the man who had unwittingly summoned this future into being.\n\nIt was said that the Americans who'd supported Trump were victims of liberal condescension. The word racist would be dismissed as a profane slur put upon the common man, as opposed to an accurate description of actual men. \"We simply don't yet know how much racism or misogyny motivated Trump voters,\" David Brooks would write in The New York Times . \"If you were stuck in a jobless town, watching your friends OD on opiates, scrambling every month to pay the electric bill, and then along came a guy who seemed able to fix your problems and hear your voice, maybe you would stomach some ugliness, too.\" This strikes me as perfectly logical. Indeed, it could apply just as well to Louis Farrakhan's appeal to the black poor and working class. But whereas the followers of an Islamophobic white nationalist enjoy the sympathy that must always greet the salt of the earth, the followers of an anti-Semitic black nationalist endure the scorn that must ever greet the children of the enslaved.\n\nMuch would be made of blue-collar voters in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan who'd pulled the lever for Obama in 2008 and 2012 and then for Trump in 2016. Surely these voters disproved racism as an explanatory force. It's still not clear how many individual voters actually flipped. But the underlying presumption-that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama could be swapped in for each other-exhibited a problem. Clinton was a candidate who'd won one competitive political race in her life, whose political instincts were questioned by her own advisers, who took more than half a million dollars in speaking fees from an investment bank because it was \"what they offered,\" who proposed to bring back to the White House a former president dogged by allegations of rape and sexual harassment. Obama was a candidate who'd become only the third black senator in the modern era; who'd twice been elected president, each time flipping red and purple states; who'd run one of the most scandal-free administrations in recent memory. Imagine an African American facsimile of Hillary Clinton: She would never be the nominee of a major political party and likely would not be in national politics at all.\n\nPointing to citizens who voted for both Obama and Trump does not disprove racism; it evinces it. To secure the White House, Obama needed to be a Harvard-trained lawyer with a decade of political experience and an incredible gift for speaking to cross sections of the country; Donald Trump needed only money and white bluster.\n\nIn the week after the election, I was a mess. I had not seen my wife in two weeks. I was on deadline for this article. My son was struggling in school. The house was in disarray. I played Marvin Gaye endlessly-\"When you left, you took all of me with you.\" Friends began to darkly recall the ghosts of post-Reconstruction. The election of Donald Trump confirmed everything I knew of my country and none of what I could accept. The idea that America would follow its first black president with Donald Trump accorded with its history. I was shocked at my own shock. I had wanted Obama to be right.\n\nI still want Obama to be right. I still would like to fold myself into the dream. This will not be possible.\n\nBy some cosmic coincidence, a week after the election I received a portion of my father's FBI file I was made aware of the FBI file by the diligent work of researchers from the show Finding Your Roots . I was taping an episode on my family the day of my last interview with the president. . My father had grown up poor in Philadelphia. His father was struck dead on the street. His grandfather was crushed to death in a meatpacking plant. He'd served his country in Vietnam, gotten radicalized there, and joined the Black Panther Party, which brought him to the attention of J. Edgar Hoover. A memo written to the FBI director was \"submitted aimed at discrediting WILLIAM PAUL COATES, Acting Captain of the BPP, Baltimore.\" The memo proposed that a fake letter be sent to the Panthers' co-founder Huey P. Newton. The fake letter accused my father of being an informant and concluded, \"I want somethin done with this bootlikin facist pig nigger and I want it done now.\" The words somethin done need little interpretation. The Panthers were eventually consumed by an internecine war instigated by the FBI, one in which being labeled a police informant was a death sentence.\n\nA few hours after I saw this file, I had my last conversation with the president. I asked him how his optimism was holding up, given Trump's victory. He confessed to being surprised at the outcome but said that it was tough to \"draw a grand theory from it, because there were some very unusual circumstances.\" He pointed to both candidates' high negatives, the media coverage, and a \"dispirited\" electorate. But he said that his general optimism about the shape of American history remained unchanged. \"To be optimistic about the long-term trends of the United States doesn't mean that everything is going to go in a smooth, direct, straight line,\" he said. \"It goes forward sometimes, sometimes it goes back, sometimes it goes sideways, sometimes it zigs and zags.\"\n\nI thought of Hoover's FBI, which harassed three generations of black activists, from Marcus Garvey's black nationalists to Martin Luther King Jr.'s integrationists to Huey Newton's Black Panthers, including my father. And I thought of the enormous power accrued to the presidency in the post-9/11 era-the power to obtain American citizens' phone records en masse, to access their emails, to detain them indefinitely. I asked the president whether it was all worth it. Whether this generation of black activists and their allies should be afraid.\n\n\"Keep in mind that the capacity of the NSA, or other surveillance tools, are specifically prohibited from being applied to U.S. citizens or U.S. persons without specific evidence of links to terrorist activity or, you know, other foreign-related activity,\" he said. \"So, you know, I think this whole story line that somehow Big Brother has massively expanded and now that a new president is in place it's this loaded gun ready to be used on domestic dissent is just not accurate.\"\n\nHe counseled vigilance, \"because the possibility of abuse by government officials always exists. The issue is not going to be that there are new tools available; the issue is making sure that the incoming administration, like my administration, takes the constraints on how we deal with U.S. citizens and persons seriously.\" This answer did not fill me with confidence. The next day, President-Elect Trump offered Lieutenant General Michael Flynn the post of national-security adviser and picked Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama as his nominee for attorney general. Last February, Flynn tweeted, \"Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL\" and linked to a YouTube video that declared followers of Islam want \"80 percent of humanity enslaved or exterminated.\" Sessions had once been accused of calling a black lawyer \"boy,\" claiming that a white lawyer who represented black clients was a disgrace to his race, and joking that he thought the Ku Klux Klan \"was okay until I found out they smoked pot.\" I felt then that I knew what was coming-more Freddie Grays, more Rekia Boyds, more informants and undercover officers sent to infiltrate mosques.\n\nAnd I also knew that the man who could not countenance such a thing in his America had been responsible for the only time in my life when I felt, as the first lady had once said, proud of my country, and I knew that it was his very lack of countenance, his incredible faith, his improbable trust in his countrymen, that had made that feeling possible. The feeling was that little black boy touching the president's hair. It was watching Obama on the campaign trail, always expecting the worst and amazed that the worst never happened. It was how I'd felt seeing Barack and Michelle during the inauguration, the car slow-dragging down Pennsylvania Avenue, the crowd cheering, and then the two of them rising up out of the limo, rising up from fear, smiling, waving, defying despair, defying history, defying gravity.\n\nTheAtlantic.com Copyright (c) 2025 by The Atlantic Monthly Group.

      "text": "A Black Army Rises to Fight the Racist Right\n\nA man calling himself Grandmaster Jay has raised a disciplined, heavily armed militia. It has yet to fire a shot at its enemies, but it's prepared for war.\n\nPhotographs by Mark Peterson / Redux\n\nW hen Grandmaster Jay walked into Million's Crab, a seafood joint in suburban Cincinnati, the waitstaff looked alarmed. Million's Crab is a family restaurant, and on that placid November evening, Jay-the supreme commander of the Not Fucking Around Coalition-was wearing body armor rated to take a pistol round directly to the chest. Dressed from mask to shoes in black, he was four hours late to our meeting, and remorseless. \"My time is scarce,\" he said, making aggressive eye contact. Indeed, of the two of us, I was the one who felt sheepish, not because I was wasting his time but because it occurred to me that while I waited, I could have warned the servers that my dining companion was often armed and that he might look as if he had just stepped out of The Matrix . He sat across from me, in front of a platter of scallops and shrimp that had been hot when I'd ordered it for him an hour before, when the kitchen was closing. I offered him a plastic bib, which he declined. He wouldn't eat any food, but he requested a San Pellegrino or, in its absence, filtered tap water.\n\nGrandmaster Jay's group, the NFAC, is a Black militia whose goals, other than to abjure Fucking Around, are obscure. It has a militarylike structure, fields an army of hundreds of heavily armed men and women, subscribes to esoteric racist doctrines, opposes Black Lives Matter, and follows a leader who thinks we live in a period of apocalyptic tribulation signaled by the movements of celestial bodies. Its modus operandi is to deploy a more fearsome Black militia wherever white militias dare to appear. Eventually, it intends to establish a racially pure country called the United Black Kemetic Nation. (\"Kemet,\" Jay explained, \"is the original name of Egypt, which means 'land of the Blacks.'\") A patch on Grandmaster Jay's body armor bore the new nation's initials, UBKN.\n\nThe NFAC leader's real name is John Fitzgerald Johnson. He is a former soldier, a failed political candidate, a hip-hop DJ, a rambling egotist, and a prolific self-promoter. His life sometimes seems like a long disinformation campaign about itself. The alternate versions of Jay do not seem to cohere into a single person. \"I've lived five different lives,\" he told me, enigmatically. \"Like a Rubik's Cube.\"\n\n\"We're not going to dig into who I am,\" he said. \"You won't get that from me.\" He said he wasn't from the Midwest. But I knew he lived near Cincinnati: I had staked out his apartment that afternoon. Even facts as straightforward as his age are not simple to determine. Some sources say he is as young as 50, others as old as 59. He is lithe enough to pass for being in his mid-40s. The best evidence-including court records-suggests that he turned 57 in December. (That might explain his given name: He would have been born just nine days after the assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy.) One hint that he is no longer a young man is a light smattering of age spots across his nose.\n\nJay claims that the NFAC first appeared publicly when nine white supremacists came to Dayton, Ohio, in May 2019. No one seems to have noticed the coalition then, amid some 600 other counterprotesters. In 2020, however, it showed up in larger numbers (Jay claims thousands, but hundreds seems more realistic) at protests over Confederate monuments and over the killing of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia; at protests over the police shooting of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky; and at protests over the police shooting of Trayford Pellerin in Lafayette, Louisiana.\n\nIn Louisville, just two hours from where Jay and I sat, the NFAC first revealed the extent of its capabilities. On his YouTube channel, Jay posted a video of his troops in formation, and local news stations ran aerial shots. The men and women are ragtag and amateur, and their uniforms are not, well, uniform. One man has a Texas-flag patch Velcroed to his body armor; a woman taps the trigger guard of her AR-15 with a three-inch yellow fingernail. But my goodness, the weaponry-AR-15s galore, sniper rifles with scopes and bipods, high-capacity magazines, and enough \"tactical\" clothing to resupply an Army-surplus store. They look like World War II partisans meeting their clandestine commander for the first time. They stand in neat, spaced columns. I counted 28 rows of seven before I stopped counting. (By contrast, aerial photos suggest that the white militiamen present that day could have fit in a small school bus.) When Jay orders his people into motion, they go.\n\nSo far, that is all they do. They do not bicker with other protesters, carry signs, or explain themselves. \"We don't come to sing,\" Jay told a reporter from Newsweek . \"We don't come to chant.\" Instead they stand, like a praetorian guard for some unseen emperor. In this laconic way, they distinguish themselves from two groups they loathe or deride: white militias (the camo-bedecked guys who show up at the same demonstrations and, sometimes, at the behest of the president, try to topple American democracy) and Black Lives Matter, whose activists tend toward nonviolence. \"That movement accomplished nothing,\" Jay told me, just \"a lot of singing, a lot of hand-holding, a lot of sentiments and praise.\"\n\nCompare the NFAC's military-style discipline, Jay said, with white militias. On January 6, at the U.S. Capitol, the insurrectionists included militia members from the groups the NFAC has arrayed itself against. Unlike the NFAC, they were flagrantly breaking the law and, for a time at least, getting away with it. \"If the NFAC had done what these folks did,\" Jay said, \"they'd still be bringing the body bags\" out of the Capitol. (If he is wrong, it's only because a Black militia that attempted to storm Congress would have been fired upon by law enforcement long before it penetrated the Capitol.) \"White people decided to act up and show us their true colors,\" Jay said. In his view, January 6 demonstrated that the NFAC is an appropriate response to a country shameless in its hypocrisy: If a disorderly white militia can sack the Capitol and get away with it, on what basis could one object to an orderly Black militia that obeys the law?\n\nOne objection to such a militia is that it is avowedly racist. Jay described its recruiting strategy: \"You must be Black,\" he said. \"If you're biracial, your father must be Black.\" The other criteria relate to recruits' ability to arm themselves without attracting the attention of law enforcement. \"Military experience is preferred,\" Jay said, and would-be coalition members must have their own AR-style rifle. \"We're not a shotgun organization.\" Anyone without a concealed-carry permit must have the clean record necessary to get one. In one of Jay's videos, he tells his followers that he intends to meet \"each and every last one of you face-to-face,\" to conduct an interrogation to \"screen out fakes, wannabes, snakes, and spiders.\" Jay says he will swear people in after they have \"put your life on the line\" by standing armed in an NFAC formation, in a situation where other armed groups might start trouble.\n\nThis is the worry of those who monitor domestic extremist threats: If you recruit an army, equip it to fight, and range it as infantry across from other armed groups, one shot could ignite a skirmish and perhaps turn downtown Louisville into Baghdad for an afternoon. Public order is the hostage of the most radical gunman present. Jay posted a video from Louisville showing white militia members expressing concern that the NFAC would annihilate them. \"There's no cover there,\" one laments to a police officer. \"NFAC shows up and decide they want to wipe us all out-we're gone in seconds.\"\n\n\"These are volatile situations,\" Amy Iandiorio, an investigative researcher for the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism, told me when I asked her about the NFAC. The coalition is \"larger than the older [white] militias. They are a lightning rod that attracts opposing groups, and that's a recipe for conflict.\"\n\n\"We have a zero-incident record,\" Jay boasted, mostly accurately. \"We've never destroyed a piece of property, or had our people arrested for anything.\" So far, the NFAC's only known casualties have been its own members, after a woman in formation sent herself and two others to the hospital when she fired her weapon seemingly by accident. (Right-wingers, gun enthusiasts, and ex-military types on social media ridicule Jay for his and his followers' poor weapons discipline.)\n\nJay's own record is blemished with accusations of violence (he denies them), and amid his long sermons about \"racial maturity\" and spiritual self-awareness, he sometimes makes alarming threats. In one video, as alleged in a criminal complaint against him, he tells his followers to burn government officials' homes and murder their children. He also advises them to destroy police body cameras if they assault cops, to remove evidence.\n\nJay is contesting these allegations in court. Even if true, such threats hardly compare with the actual storming of the Capitol. Yet it is rarely good news when you learn that a sectarian racist is raising an army, stockpiling weapons, demanding total loyalty, and suggesting that he is a \" messiah . \" Jay speaks prophetically, and sometimes apocalyptically. Followers of his teachings, he said, \"would be the first to tell you ... nothing that I have predicted has not come true.\" In October, on YouTube, he told his soldiers, \"At this point, I don't think I'll be joining you all too much longer. Just remember that when I'm gone, these will be your instructional videos.\"\n\nIn early December, the FBI raided his apartment and arrested him on charges that, during a September demonstration in Louisville, he pointed a rifle at federal agents, blinding them with its mounted light. Jay told me that all the allegations against him are \"bullshit.\" By bringing them up, federal prosecutors are trying to \"character assassinate\" him. \"I'm a student of history,\" he said. \"Anytime someone starts to galvanize people, it's the same process\": character assassination, then financial assassination through mounting legal bills, then imprisonment, exile, or outright murder. Jay is now out on bail. His social-media accounts are frozen, and he faces a possible 20-year sentence-which may or may not be a deterrent, if he thinks his end is near anyway.\n\nT he filtered water must have lowered his inhibitions, because over the next two hours Jay became more garrulous. His story, and the purpose of Not Fucking Around, became a little more clear, and a little less.\n\nHe grew up in Richmond, Virginia, and New York City. According to Pentagon records, he joined the military in 1989. At some point he got married, though he refused to say more about his domestic life. He told me that he spent four years in the Army in Germany, where he revised his racial self-understanding. \"I saw that I had been socialized to believe that I was second-class, that there was something criminal inherent about me,\" he said. In Germany, Jay was \"treated with the utmost respect,\" and he said he enjoyed a reprieve from the American racial hierarchy. When he met Americans overseas, they tended to interact with one another more as compatriots in exile than as the race enemies they might have been at home.\n\nHe visited Auschwitz, he said, and was indelibly influenced by what he saw. In our conversation, though, he made no direct reference to the mass murder of Jews and others, or to the lessons of totalitarian fascism. Instead, he mentioned that he was impressed by postwar Germany's decision to outlaw Holocaust denial and the glorification of Nazism. The United States, he thinks, has failed to show the same backbone in reckoning with its crimes against Black people. He considers Germany's \"a genuine effort by society to restore and repair those people who were the victims of this Holocaust.\"\n\nLike so much else about Jay, this passion for European Jewry presents a contradiction: Elsewhere, he has quoted Hitler approvingly and suggested that the Jews of Europe-\"those people running around calling themselves the Jews\"-are imposters. He has also seemed to flirt with Holocaust denial. (A sample lyric from one of his hip-hop songs: \"They call you racist if you proud of your folks / But they be muting you now if you forget about the Holocaust!\")\n\nJay's videos repeat several themes popular among anti-Semitic segments of the Black Hebrew Israelites, a religious movement known for noisy proselytizing and elaborate conspiracy theories. One way to understand the NFAC is to imagine what a paramilitary wing of the Black Hebrew Israelites would be like. (Jay denied all charges of anti-Semitism but refused to answer when I asked directly whether he thought Jews died in large numbers in the Holocaust. \"I've visited the death camps. I've studied the documents. I've seen for myself,\" he said. \"I don't have to justify my experiences in my position to anyone.\")\n\nJay's military career, like most things about him, is strange. After basic training, the Army assigns every soldier a military occupational specialty, or MOS: 11B is an infantryman, 94S is a Patriot system repairer, 12K is a plumber. Most soldiers have just one MOS over the course of their career; once the Army trains a soldier, why go through the expense of training him again? \"I had five MOSs,\" Jay said. This is like majoring in five different subjects in college-not technically against the rules, but rare and implausible. He named four but refused to identify the fifth. Later, Jay said he had only two MOSs.\n\nMeanwhile, Jay acquired a record of violence. According to the affidavit in support of his indictment in Louisville, he was arrested in 1995 for punching a woman in the face, and for menacing a man with a 20-gauge shotgun. He left the Army in 1997 but despised civilian life. (He told his YouTube audience that he hated it: \"You all were the most uncivilized, undisciplined people I had ever seen.\") He reenlisted in July 1998, but a year later he faced a court martial for another offense. He was busted down to the lowest rank-private-and drummed out of the Army with an \"other than honorable\" discharge.\n\nIn August 2003, according to the affidavit, Jay entered Fort Bragg and \"threatened to kill his wife\" (who was also a soldier) and her platoon sergeant at a recognition ceremony. Somehow, after all of this, Jay re enlisted that December, this time as an Army reservist. He attained the rank of sergeant, went absent without leave just over a year later, then escaped court martial by getting out of the Army a third time, again under other-than-honorable conditions, and again reduced to private. Despite these travails-or because of them-Jay modeled the NFAC on the military in which he had served. It's an extremely top-down, chain-of-command organization, perfect for people who like to take orders, or give them. The NFAC is this private's chance to be a general.\n\nAfter his final discharge, Jay disappeared for several years. He later claimed to have worked as the \"director of a global cloud-integration practice and solutions architect.\" He tried a career as a hip-hop DJ, which took an embarrassing turn when stars including Grandmaster Flash and DJ Jazzy Jeff accused him of plagiarism and résumé exaggeration . Jay said the accusations were a misunderstanding, but he also suggested to me, in a peculiar and indirect way, that he had made certain mistakes. \"When they finally admit that we have the capability to time travel,\" he said, \"I would love to see one of us go back and meet ourselves five years ago, or 10 years ago. You would sit that person down and have a word with him.\"\n\nJ ay reappeared in 2015 as an ally of the movement he now denigrates, Black Lives Matter. \"I was caught up in all that-I, too, was waving signs and chanting,\" he said. He showed up during uprisings following various outrages, such as the murder of nine parishioners at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, by a white supremacist. He led a crowd of tens of thousands across the Arthur Ravenel Bridge to protest the mass shooting. After the murder of Walter Scott by a North Charleston police officer, he appeared at the side of Scott's family. \"I was there to escort Walter Scott's mother into the funeral.\" He said he was an ordained minister at the time. Photos from the funeral show Jay wearing an Anglican-style clerical collar and holding Judy Scott's left arm. (At some point, he repudiated the \"Black Lives Matter\" slogan. \"It's not Black lives that matter anymore,\" he tells a crowd in an undated video . \" All lives!\")\n\nIn 2016, he emerged again, wearing a dark business suit with a black tie, pocket square, and large wristwatch. His website, onlywecanfixus.com , advertised a bid for the White House on an independent ticket. His platform consisted of mostly liberal platitudes, with an emphasis on diversity, police reform, support for veterans, and action on climate change-\"almost indistinguishable,\" he said, from Bernie Sanders's. He lost to Donald Trump and concluded, like most independent candidates, that America had rigged politics against him.\n\nThe only way to win was to play a different game. On August 21, 2017, he witnessed the total eclipse of the sun while standing outside the city hall of Carbondale, Illinois. He swooned during the eclipse, felt a wave of energy, and began preaching the ideas of the NFAC soon after. He said that the NFAC \"was born out of the atmosphere created by Donald Trump,\" not out of a spiritual revelation. But the transformation does not appear coincidental. From that point on, he was \"spitting knowledge\" on social media, much of it about alien spacecraft (\"visitors\") and odd phenomena he noticed in the sky. He also said he had a health scare. \"I was supposed to be dead two years ago,\" he told his followers. \"But I'm not. I'm still here because I was cured in a way that defies medicine and changed my entire brain structure.\" He began eating differently, and drinking \"alkaline water\" to \"reactivate\" his pineal gland and scrub his system of impurities that were impeding \"higher abilities.\" His drink order-San Pellegrino or filtered tap water-had spiritual implications.\n\nFew paid attention until Jay showed up with dozens of armed followers in Georgia last year, and phrased his new beliefs in a militant idiom. Laws, he told me, are \"just paper,\" and it is only reasonable that Black people arm and train themselves to act as \"an immediate bulwark against the continued human-rights abuses\" perpetrated against them. \"Too much talking. Time for the action,\" he said.\n\nTommie Shelby, a professor of African American studies and philosophy at Harvard, noted that these ideas have precursors in Black political thought. Armed self-defense has been around at least since Cyril Briggs, who founded the African Blood Brotherhood in 1919. During the period after the First World War, when white mobs were shooting Black people and burning their businesses, many Black people considered peaceful protests (such as those organized by the NAACP) inadequate. Four decades later, the activist Robert F. Williams wrote the classic text of Black armed resistance, Negroes With Guns , which argues that violence against Black people calls for violence by Black people. The tradition of armed resistance persisted even as the civil-rights movement succeeded by rejecting this fearful symmetry: Martin Luther King Jr., Bayard Rustin, and John Lewis showed that Black people without guns were much more formidable.\n\nJay said he does not admire or imitate any Black activists from previous generations-he protested when I suggested a comparison to the Black Panthers, whose aesthetic the NFAC has obviously ripped off-but was quick to defend the Jamaican political thinker and activist Marcus Garvey, who called for Black self-sufficiency and attempted to found a homeland for Black people. When I mentioned W. E. B. Du Bois, Jay cut me off to condemn Du Bois as a \"bourgeois\" and \"an enemy to the movement Marcus Garvey started ...  If [Du Bois] was alive today, he would eat his words.\"\n\nLike Garvey's, Jay's rhetoric calls for Black self-reliance and segregation from white people. His goal, he said, is \"for the Black race to come into its own-which it has not\"-and to \"mature as a race,\" first by building \"racial esteem.\" He said Black people have been like \"the guy who sleeps on your couch that doesn't go home until you have to throw the couch out with him.\" If they get armed, and get serious, they will no longer \"have to blame the non-melanated\" for their failure. Ultimately, Jay calls for \"descendants of the Portuguese and Atlantic slave trade\" to separate themselves from others and create a Black ethnostate.\n\nThe United Black Kemetic Nation, he said, would have the full recognition of international law. \"What we're talking [about] here is a legal action that takes us from being freed slaves and descendants of slaves in a country that classifies us by color and denigrates us by race to a place where we are citizens of our own country,\" he said. The location of this new country is negotiable, and as a model he considered Wyoming, because of its cheap land. But Jay told me that when he floated Wyoming to his followers, their response was: \"Hell no-nobody wants to go to Wyoming.\" (Shelby notes that the desire to establish a Black homeland on American territory likewise has a long history, showing up in Harry Haywood's book Negro Liberation in the 1940s and the Republic of New Afrika movement in the '60s and '70s.)\n\nAs Jay browsed real estate, he also made overseas allies, he said, in Black-liberation movements in Africa and Europe. \"These people are screaming our name while they're resisting,\" he said, although no such screams have been independently documented. He claimed to have enlisted the Niger Delta Avengers, a militant group that has been blowing up pipelines and other infrastructure in Nigeria, as part of his coalition, which will eventually be the \"military backbone\" of the UBKN.\n\nTo demonstrate its power, Jay said, the NFAC aims to assemble, in one place, \"a million legal [Black] gun owners,\" to show that the United Black Kemetic Nation can defend itself. Part of the process of creating a new country (under a treaty known as the Montevideo Convention) is demonstrating that enough people are eager to live there permanently and can administer the new state. That includes defending it. Jay said, \"If I assemble 1 million legal guns, I have the fifth-largest ground army on the planet. I think that's a pretty significant indication ... There are 57 million of us here. All I want is 1 [million].\" (According to the Census Bureau, 47 million Americans identify as Black or Black and another race. Because of Jay's patrilineal theory of race, he would presumably recognize a smaller number still.)\n\nH ow can you get even 1 million armed followers if just a few years ago you were a failed DJ and now you believe that San Pellegrino will give you preternatural mental powers? These do not sound like promising beginnings for a modern Simón Bolívar or Toussaint L'Ouverture.\n\nBut Jay has loyal followers, maybe in spite of these eccentricities, and maybe because of them. Most people do not think it sensible to channel their justified rage by buying an AR-15 and joining a cultlike paramilitary organization. Nor do most Americans-let alone most Black Americans-want to establish a racially pure state, even somewhere other than Wyoming. But the desire for action of some kind, acknowledging that Black people are uniquely menaced, is to be expected. Watching a mob storm the Capitol with a Confederate battle flag should freak out any American who hates racism, and inspire such a person to seek a radical cure for a deep political sickness. Jay offers a remedy prepackaged and ready to deliver. Unfortunately, Jay's answer-create a parallel, quasi-fascist race army with its own flag and homeland-strikes me as a particularly bad case of becoming that which you hate.\n\nThe NFAC also appears to have tapped into a kind of modish authoritarian magical thinking. Plenty of Trump supporters believed that their man had a mystical ability to outwit his opponents and bend previously unbendable laws of politics. He could say anything, do anything, and somehow survive. (Many still believe this.) In Jay, NFAC followers have a leader who conjured an army ex nihilo, announced a Black uprising in multiple American cities, and somehow got away with it for months. (I wonder how many of them regard Jay's fraudulent past the way Trump supporters regard the former president's-i.e., if such a clown could get this far, he must have divine favor.) Jay has terrible ideas, and in ordinary circumstances most people would identify them as crazy and reject them. In 2020 and its aftermath, however, there is a greater-than-usual demand for someone who seems to have at least a little skill at propitiating the angry gods.\n\nSurely, though, there must be limits to what Jay's followers can accept. At one point in our conversation, I thought I might have detected such a limit. We'd spent an hour talking some sense, and a lot of nonsense; now the restaurant staff presented me with the bill and a doggie bag, and exiled us to the parking lot. We sat in Jay's SUV, which soon filled with pleasant Cajun aromas from the scallops. At that point, for the first time, the conversation flowed more naturally. Jay had run out of boilerplate.\n\n\"You mentioned time travel and you mentioned alien spacecraft,\" I said. \"Do you know anything about these things?\"\n\nJay paused. \"I'm not at liberty to discuss those.\" I asked if he felt obliged to oaths of secrecy sworn to the U.S. military that had twice expelled him from its ranks. He said yes, but I pressed him to continue.\n\n\"Very interesting,\" Jay said, speaking slowly and deliberately for the first time since his performance that night had begun. \"Someone asked me the other day, they said, 'How is it that you've managed to do in six months what other people have not been able to do for 60 years?' ... I would simply say that knowing the future doesn't help. Unless you have a deep, personal, hands-on experience with the past.\"\n\n\"A lot of times when people talk about time travel, they always run into the paradigm 'If you change something in the past, then you'll screw up your present.'\" Jay shook his head. \"Think of it in terms of alternate paths.\" He said that by \"stepping off this timeline into another timeline,\" you create a new reality. \"Yes, you can screw up things in that timeline. But when you return to your timeline, nothing has changed!\" He continued. \"There is no set future. There are multiple futures depending on the timeline that you set in motion.\" He said one cannot really change the past-just mint a new timeline.\n\n\"Twenty-twenty is a great example. You all are living in an alternate timeline. Everything's upside down; the world a year ago is completely 180 degrees from where you are now ... and people are just blundering through it without realizing that you're living in an alternate timeline. How did we get here? That's the kicker. You figure that part out, you'll figure out everything that I'm talking about.\"\n\nI thanked Jay for his time, and he thanked me for mine. A month later, the police raided his apartment. Among the small armory of assault rifles, they also found a prodigious amount of marijuana.\n\nA fter Jay's arrest in December, he ordered his followers into a \"stand-down position.\" The militias that the NFAC opposes, such as the Oath Keepers , were active during December and January-and because of their presence at the storming of the Capitol, they now feel the heat of law enforcement. On January 6, the NFAC had no presence in Washington: The District of Columbia does not allow open carry of weapons. When I talked with him in February, Jay gloated about his enemies' legal jeopardy, with some justification. \"The U.S. government is going around cleaning up all of those other organizations,\" he said. \"We're watching.\" This strategic stand-down was not entirely voluntary, of course. By arresting Jay, the government took him out of circulation as a militia leader. He won't be able to post instructional videos for some time, because of the social-media ban that was a condition of his bail. The cops took his rifles too.\n\nJay would not accept a foot soldier who showed up for inspection unarmed. Ironically, though, the government's confiscation of his weapons has proved at least one of Jay's prophecies. Jay previously argued that Black people, exercising their constitutional rights to speak and pack heat, would be treated differently from white people doing the same. The crime he is now charged with is a real one-pointing guns at cops is illegal and wrong-but poor muzzle discipline and poor judgment are universal at armed protests, and I suspect that other armed protesters have performed equally negligent acts and gotten little more than a dirty look and a chewing out from the cops. Right-wing militias stormed Michigan's capitol and were not arrested.\n\nJay's disarming has occasioned a shift in his emphasis, if not tone. When I spoke with him after January 6, he still slipped into periodic fits of rage at the impertinence of my questions, but he stressed that the NFAC is \"peaceful\" and wants to \"open up a dialogue and stabilize the situation.\"\n\nBut Jay did not raise a militia by cultivating a tranquil persona, and the NFAC members who heeded his call at his craziest moments will not wait forever for him to revoke his stand-down order and recover his insanity. They joined a group that promised to take a bite out of the Earth and reserve it for Black people. They expected to be led by a commander who preaches radical separatism, and who will swagger with an AR-15 in public and boast that his snipers can bisect a white militiaman's head from 1,000 yards away. Jay told me that he already had to vet his recruits carefully. \"Some people come to change the world,\" he said, \"and some come to end it all.\" The latter, he implied, are unwelcome in the NFAC and have to be screened out. The NFAC has room for only one messiah. But even those who originally joined with peaceful intent can become jaded, given enough time, injustice, and absentee leadership.\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

      "text": "When Do Multicultural Ads Become Offensive? Your Thoughts\n\nReaders debate a recent Atlantic article on race and advertising in the 1970s. Tom Burrell, the legendary adman, responds to critics of his early work.\n\nAs part of The Atlantic's \" Selling the Seventies \" series, my colleague Lenika Cruz recently explored the moment in the early 1970s when major companies began marketing directly to African Americans. The resulting debate in the comments section revolved around a central tension in the ad industry: How to connect with demographics without stepping on stereotypes. Regarding the ads featured in Lenika's piece, mostly from McDonald's, commenter JohnJMac facepalms:\n\nMy God, these commercials are hysterical. It's a parody of what a bunch of white Mad Men would conceive, having spent a weekend watching movies starring Pamela Grier.\n\nBenson Stein says of the early '70s, \"This was the era of blaxploitation films such as Blacula , Shaft , Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song , so I could see this spilling over into mainstream advertising.\" UrbanRedneck2 , on the other hand, shrugs:\n\nI don't get the problem. The ads were showing African Americans dressed in the way they often did back then and also showed how many of them talked. So what's the problem? Why does every advertisement have to be sanitized and one size fits all?\n\nKlugerRD points to a part of the story that's missing:\n\nYou get the impression from the article that the normal white-populated agencies did these McDonald's ads. Wrong.\n\nIn 1971, Tom Burrell started his own ad agency in Chicago called Burrell Communications. Tom was an African-American guy who began a trend with agencies specializing in creating advertising targeted at African Americans. He began with accounts like Coca-Cola, Philip Morris, and McDonald's. So it's very likely the ads you showed were done by Burrell or another African-American agency.\n\nI reached out to Tom Burrell and he confirmed that those McDonald's ads were indeed from his agency. He also mentioned that his founding partner, Emmett McBain, submitted a bunch of prints to the Smithsonian back in 1985, so I ventured down to the archives of the National Museum of American History to check them out. (Coincidentally, the museum is about to open a big new exhibit on business history that includes \"marketing campaigns targeted to diverse audiences, including teens, African Americans and Latinos.\") Here's one of the prints from the McBain collection:\n\nAs awkward or even offensive as that copy might look today, did it offend black people at the time? Lowell Thompson , an African American adman since 1968 who worked at Burrell Advertising and helped Burrell on his book , appeared in our comments section to shed some light on the question:\n\nWhat seems so lame and stereotypical to EurAmericans here in 2015 seemed much less so to AfrAmerican in 1970. Most AfrAmericans were happy to be recognized as thinking, buying human beings after over 300 years of being \"branded\" as subhuman beasts. (I'm working on a book, \" Mad Invisible Men & Women ,\" that chronicles the history of \"black\" images and image makers in America.)\n\nCommenter Valyrian Steel suspects the McDonald's ads were successful:\n\nThe purpose of an ad campaign isn't to fit the sensitivity rubric of a professor's race, class, and gender seminar 40 years into the future. Ads exist to sell product. So the article omits the most important and interesting info: Did these campaigns (no matter how clumsy) increase revenue in the demo? Given that McDonald's has far more locations, market share, and revenue than any other restaurant on Earth, I suspect the ads worked extraordinarily well.\n\nAfter studying the slogan for McDonald's [in 1971], \"You deserve a break today,\" Burrell decided it was ineffective in reaching blacks. He believed the theme presented McDonald's as being a \"special treat\" that families used sporadically. In contrast, his research suggested that McDonald's restaurants were a part of many blacks' daily experience. Therefore the idea that the restaurants were only useful when one needed or wanted a break was meaningless to blacks. In place of the original slogan, he suggested the theme \"McDonald's is good to have around\" for the black consumer market.\n\nThe new slogan and accompany advertising campaign were a hit among black consumers. From that point onward, McDonald's remained one of the agencies largest clients.\n\nI asked Burrell to respond to the critiques of his McDonald's ads from Professor Charlton McIlwain and adman Neil Drossman, who were quoted in Lenika's piece:\n\n\"Cynical\"? \"Superficial\"? All of these comments take me from confused to incredulous. Are you sure they're referring to Burrell's advertising?  The comments have me bewildered because, after making critical comments about the McDonald's ads, both go on to speak of general market agencies. I say \"incredulous\" because I can't believe commercials like \"Daddy's Home\", \" First Glasses \", \"Joey\", \"Double Dutch\" [seen below], \" Counting Fries ,\" \"Family Reunion\", \" Calvin \" and countless other classics could be perceived as negative, cynical and shallow.\n\nOur agency has been consistently heralded by consumers, corporations, community and trade organizations for the respect with which we address the African-American consumer. So I'm more than a little confused by the criticism. I'm also not sure what is being recommended as an antidote to what they perceive to be problematic.\n\n[Ed. note: This Coke ad from Burrell in '76 won him his first Clio, the industry's version of an Oscar:\n\nI am sure we, on occasion, might have been less than perfect, but we also know the following from years of research during my 32+ years in charge:\n\nDrossman emails a response to Burrell:\n\nI said I thought those three McDonald's ads [one seen to the left] were cynical and superficial. Little bit a sterotypin' goin' on there, no? I still think that. Listen, we all get up to the plate and strike out every now and then. In no way was this an indictment of Burrell Communications. I didn't even know who did those ads. But I thought they were representative of the tone deafness of the times.\n\nI have seen a lot of your work and there's much to be proud of there. And you have the awards and accolades to show for it. What's more, agencies like yours were pioneers in their efforts to reach the African-American market, an underserved market, given short shift by the mainstream agencies of the '50s, '60s and '70s. My view is that it wasn't a sea change, maybe just a puddle change.\n\nMcIlwain also believes the '70s \"did not live up to those bold intentions\" of Burrell and other ad pioneers:\n\nOn the one hand, black folks for the first time began seeing themselves in television advertising. For folks who had been so invisible for so many years, to look and say \"hey, I see myself on that screen.\" That was significant.\n\nOn the other hand, people viewing advertisements rarely know the personalities and circumstances behind the production. They take the ads at face value. For the McDonald's ads and many others (produced by many others), that meant that many Black folks would likely respond, \"I don't talk like that?\" \"I don't look like that way when I eat, and, by the way, I don't have any trouble with tipping.\"\n\nHere's Burrell again:\n\nThe \"casualization\" of the English language, while strongly associated with black culture, came into being long before the '70s, and it goes far beyond the black race. G-dropping? If I recall correctly, there were lily-white ditties like \"Puttin' on the Ritz,\" \"Doodlin',\" \"Makin' Whoopee,\" \"Goin' Fishin',\" \"Moanin',\" \"Nothin' says lovin' like somethin' from the oven,\" \"Hey, Good Lookin', whatcha got cookin'?,\" \"S'posin',\" \"Singin' in the Rain,\" etc.\n\nSo let's dispel the specious notion that g-'droppin' was created in the '70s to reach black consumers. It all came down to attempts (admittedly occasionally failed) to warm up what had been a stilted or non-existing relationship between the advertiser and black consumer.\n\nFor more on the history behind Burrell's work and others', be sure to check out Planet Money's recent episode \"This Ad's For You.\" Back to our readers, here's KoreanKat :\n\nWhile it is interesting to analyze these '70s ads, it invites the overcompensating leftist reflex to denounce them disproportionate to their historical distance and context. It's also important to remember you can't please everyone. If advertisers depict minority persons reflecting mainstream culture, I can see the same ______ Studies professors inveighing about how it is \"white washing\" diversity.\n\nThe Acedian points a finger at the media:\n\nI've a feeling that younger journalists have no real connection to the eras they're writing about and feel everything from a bygone era was \"racist.\" People in urban communities did indeed speak in a certain way, as many U.S. regions tend to have their own vernacular, inflection, and pronunciation, and advertisers were never shy about picking up on that to \"speak\" to those demographics.\n\nKwame_zulu_shabazz nods:\n\nYes, Acedian, I had a similar take. Some of the critique in the Atlantic article sounded like upwardly mobile black \"respectability politics.\" African Americans in ghettos (I'm from Inglewood) frequently dropped the \"g,\" so it seems to be the opposite of \"tone deaf.\"\n\nAnd marathag doesn't see the g-droppin' as anything special: \"All advertising is really cynical and nothing but superficial effort to 'reach' a targeted audience.\" Tom agrees:\n\nPainfully stupid ads aimed at blacks was not the end of it. This era was filled with painfully stupid and overly earnest ads aimed at young people, where everyone said \"groovy\" and \"let's rap\" (in the '70s, \"rap\" meant \"talk\") and dressed like a middle-class hippie.\n\nA prime example was easy to find:\n\nA snipe from poolside :\n\nNever seen in The Atlantic : An article about how Marlboro perpetuated \"fraught stereotypes\" of white Americans by featuring a cowboy on a trail ride.\n\nSpeaking of Marlboro, Burrell was also hired by Philip Morris in the early '70s to develop a \"Black Marlboro Man.\" The company had already tried to market directly to black smokers but with little success.\n\nThose ads appeared in Ebony magazine in July 1970 and June 1970, respectively, and they featured Bill Pickett and Bronco Sam , two black cowboys from the late 19 th century. The ads flopped. Another one I saw in the Smithsonian archives, from 1968, features a standard scene of the Marlboro Man riding a horse juxtaposed with an inset of a formally-dressed black couple lighting a cigarette: \"Come to Marlboro Country.\" It's as if Philip Morris just slapped a stock image of African Americans onto an existing ad, and the contrast looks bizarre.\n\nThen, in 1972, Burrell and McBain stepped in. From Madison Avenue and the Color Line :\n\n[Burrell and McBain] argued that, although whites considered the Marlboro Man a \"hero,\" blacks considered him a \"loser.\" Research suggested that blacks defined manhood as \"a man who took charge of family, lived in the city, [and] was involved with people in a responsible role.\" Where the cowboy was an individual, a black man was with his family or friends; where the cowboy was alone, a black man was active in his community.\n\nTherefore blacks' definition of manhood was an almost complete reversal of that of both the white and black individualistic cowboys prevalent in Marlboro ads. The advertisements created by Burrell and McBain [...] featured a black man as the central figure, located in urban settings, involved with his community, and on the move.\n\nTwo examples from the McBain collection:\n\nAnother ad in the archives features a \"Black Marlboro Man\" with an Afro browsing a sidewalk sale with a female companion in a head wrap. Another ad shows a similar man buying fruit from an older black gentleman on the street. AdAge acknowledges , \"The campaign was able to increase the brand's market share among African-American males.\"\n\nCommenter Sirius Jones fast-forwards:\n\nIt's a huge shame that ads today have gone in the complete opposite direction as the early '70s. Every time there are non-whites represented in advertising they're always white washed. Advertisers feel as though there is nothing distinct about people of color. They are nothing more than white people who were dipped in paint. You see blacks in advertisements wearing a European suit smiling nicely with his white colleague. You see a black guy wearing a polo shirt watching some white sitcom. POC are treated as white people with no distinct culture.\n\nDiana Mitford responds:\n\nThe only solution is to have PoC make their own ads. We need more diversity in the workplace to represent the multicultural place that America is becoming.\n\nSome pioneering examples of multicultural ads were chronicled by Kyle Coward in his recent Atlantic piece, \" When Hip-Hop First Went Corporate \":\n\nThis 30-second 1994 commercial was part of a campaign for St. Ides, a low-cost, previously obscure brand of malt liquor, that was the first to weave a hip-hop aesthetic into its central messaging.\n\nToday-when Dr. Dre is an Apple executive, Jay-Z has partnered with Samsung on an album release, and Snoop Dogg has appeared in Chrysler commercials-the St. Ides campaign appears strange, a relic from a time when hip-hop culture hadn't yet earned wider Madison Avenue respect.\n\n\"Back then, part of the excitement within the hip-hop subculture, as it still was at that time, was the dawning realization of the potential for hip-hop marketization,\" says Eithne Quinn, a senior lecturer in American Studies at the University of Manchester, in the United Kingdom. \"Many artists, from poor backgrounds as they often were, didn't see this as selling out.\" ...\n\n[W]hat made St. Ides different was that it's one of the earliest examples-if not the earliest-of a brand with no inherent ties to hip-hop completely building its identity around the genre, entrusting the culture's tastemakers with its messaging.\n\nA more recent example of entrusting hip-hop tastemakers with ad messaging occurred in 2013 when Mountain Dew hired Tyler, The Creator to write and direct a series of three commercials:\n\nTwitter exploded in outrage, led by Syracuse academic Boyce Watkins, who called the third ad \"arguably the most racist commercial in history.\" Tyler responded at length :\n\nI guess he found it racist because I was portraying stereotypes, which is ridiculous because, one, all of those dudes [in the line-up] are my friends. Two, they're all basically in their own clothes. [...] Three, no [commenters] saw that commercial and said, this is racist. Everyone either said, \"Wow, this is ridiculous, it's a goat talking,\" or they said, \"Wow, this is the dumbest, why would they even make this?\" [...]\n\nIt's a black guy making this, and if it's so racist and feeding into stereotypes, why in the first commercial that goes along with it, is there a black male with his Asian wife? In the second commercial, it's a black male with a professional job as a police officer listening to hardcore rock music -- which supposedly the stereotype is that black people don't listen to that.\n\nCan you think of other controversial ads that blurred the line between authenticity and stereotype? Email hello@theatlantic.com and I'll update the post with the best examples. Update from a reader:\n\nThis is an interesting topic. All the concerns people express really put a spotlight on contemporary culture more than they do on the past. Why is something seen as awkward or offensive when it wasn't awkward or offensive in the past?\n\nHere's a commercial from the '80s for Busch beer:\n\nI presume it worked well and sold beer and did so by connecting the people of the '80s with an image of American men, idealized but still relatable. It's more of a satire today, but back then, I'm assuming, it was ordinary and tapped into people's identity. Interpret it from the present cultural perspective and see how sexualized it appears now.\n\nThough not quite as sexualized as Schmitts . Another reader emails:\n\nI enjoyed the article. One piece of media I did not see included was billboards.\n\nAs a white person who grew up in one of the first suburbs of St. Louis to integrate, I watched the accompanying white flight to the outer burbs away from \"those people\" with much sadness; I did not understand why someone escaping the mess of the inner city schools was a horrible thing. I watched our billboards go from a very wide range of product  to a very few damaging products targeted to African Americans. Billboards in our area suddenly became about Kool's, Salem's, Newport's, Colt 45, Remy Martin, Rent-A-Center, the Army, white bread, and fried chicken. Much later: cash for gold, pawn shops, and payday loans.\n\nIt always struck me as reaching for the lowest common denominator. Did black people not buy cars, appliances, and all the other things white people bought?"

      "text": "What We Mean When We Say 'Race Is a Social Construct'\n\nIn a world where Kevin Garnett, Harold Ford, and Halle Berry all check \"black\" on the census, even the argument that racial labels refer to natural differences in physical traits doesn't hold up.\n\nAndrew Sullivan and Freddie Deboer have two pieces up worth checking out. I disagree with Andrew's (though I detect some movement in his position.) Freddie's piece is entitled \"Precisely How Not to Argue About Race and IQ.\" He writes:\n\nThe problem with people who argue for inherent racial inferiority is not that they lie about the results of IQ tests, but that they are credulous about those tests and others like them when they shouldn't be; that they misunderstand the implications of what those tests would indicate even if they were credible; and that they fail to find the moral, analytic, and political response to questions of race and intelligence.\n\nI think this is a good point, but I want to expand it. Most of the honest writing I've seen on \"race and intelligence\" focuses on critiquing the idea of \"intelligence.\" So there's lot of good literature on whether it can be measured, its relevance in modern society, whether intelligence changes across generations, whether it changes with environment, and what we mean when we say IQ. As Freddie mentions here , I had a mathematician stop past to tell me I needed to stop studying French, and immediately start studying statistics-otherwise I can't possibly understand this debate.\n\nIt's a fair critique. My response is that he should stop studying math and start studying history.\n\nI am not being flip or coy. If you tell me that you plan to study \"race and intelligence\" then it is only fair that I ask you, \"What do you mean by race?\" It's true I don't always do math so well, but I understand the need to define the terms of your study. If you're a math guy, perhaps your instinct is to point out the problems in the interpretation of the data. My instinct is to point out that your entire experiment proceeds from a basic flaw- no coherent, fixed definition of race actually exists.\n\nThe history bears this out. In 1856, Ralph Waldo Emerson delineated the significance of race :\n\nIt is race, is it not, that puts the hundred millions of India under the dominion of a remote island in the north of Europe. Race avails much, if that be true, which is alleged, that all Celts are Catholics, and all Saxons are Protestants; that Celts love unity of power, and Saxons the representative principle. Race is a controlling influence in the Jew, who, for two millenniums, under every climate, has preserved the same character and employments. Race in the negro is of appalling importance. The French in Canada, cut off from all intercourse with the parent people, have held their national traits. I chanced to read Tacitus \"on the Manners of the Germans,\" not long since, in Missouri, and the heart of Illinois, and I found abundant points of resemblance between the Germans of the Hercynian forest, and our Hoosiers, Suckers, and Badgers of the American woods.\n\nIndeed, Emerson in 1835, saw race as central to American greatness:\n\nThe inhabitants of the United States, especially of the Northern portion, are descended from the people of England and have inherited the traits of their national character ... It is common with the Franks to break their faith and laugh at it The race of Franks is faithless.\n\nEmerson was not alone, as historian James McPherson points out. Southerners thought of themselves not only as a race separate from blacks, but as a race apart from Northern whites :\n\nThe South's leading writer on political economy, James B. D. De Bow, subscribed to this Norman-Cavalier thesis and helped to popularize it in De Bow's Review. As the lower-South states seceded one after another during the winter of 1860-61, this influential journal carried several long articles justifying secession on the grounds of irreconcilable ethnic differences between Southern and Northern whites. \"The Cavaliers, Jacobites, and Huguenots, who settled the South, naturally hate, contemn, and despise the Puritans who settled the North,\" proclaimed one of these articles. \"The former are a master-race; the latter a slave race, the descendants of Saxon serfs.\" The South was now achieving its \"independent destiny\" by repudiating the failed experiment of civic nationalism that had foolishly tried in 1789 to \"erect one nation out of two irreconcilable peoples.\"\n\nSimilarly, in 1899 William Z. Ripley wrote The Races of Europe , which sought to delineate racial difference through head-type:\n\nThe shape of the human head by which we mean the general proportions of length, breadth, and height, irrespective of the \" bumps \" of the phrenologist is one of the best available tests of race known. Its value is, at the same time, but imperfectly appreciated beyond the inner circle of professional anthropology. Yet it is so simple a phenomenon, both in principle and in practical application, that it may readily be of use to the traveller and the not too superficial observer of men.\n\nTo be sure, widespread and constant peculiarities of head form are less noticeable in America, because of the extreme variability of our population, compounded as it is of all the races of Europe; they seem also to be less fundamental among the American aborigines. But in the Old World the observant traveller may with a little attention often detect the racial affinity of a people by this means.\n\nTwo years later, Edward A. Ross sought to apprehend \" The Causes of Race Superiority .\" He saw the differences between the Arab \"race\" and the Jewish \"race\" as a central illustration:\n\nIt is certain that races differ in their attitude toward past and future. M. Lapie has drawn a contrast between the Arab and the Jew. The Arab remembers; he is mindful of past favors and past injuries. He harbors his vengeance and cherishes his gratitude. He accepts everything on the authority of tradition, loves the ways of his ancestors, forms strong local attachments, and migrates little. The Jew, on the other hand, turns his face toward the future. He is thrifty and always ready for a good stroke of business, will, indeed, join with his worst enemy if it pays. He is calculating, enterprising, migrant and ambitious\n\nYou can see more of this here .\n\nOur notion of what constitutes \"white\" and what constitutes \"black\" is a product of social context. It is utterly impossible to look at the delineation of a \"Southern race\" and not see the Civil War, the creation of an \"Irish race\" and not think of Cromwell's ethnic cleansing, the creation of a \"Jewish race\" and not see anti-Semitism. There is no fixed sense of \"whiteness\" or \"blackness,\" not even today. It is quite common for whites to point out that Barack Obama isn't really \"black\" but \"half-white.\" One wonders if they would say this if Barack Obama were a notorious drug lord.\n\nWhen the liberal says \"race is a social construct,\" he is not being a soft-headed dolt; he is speaking a historical truth. We do not go around testing the \"Irish race\" for intelligence or the \"Southern race\" for \"hot-headedness.\" These reasons are social. It is no more legitimate to ask \"Is the black race dumber than then white race?\" than it is to ask \"Is the Jewish race thriftier than the Arab race?\"\n\nThe strongest argument for \"race\" is that people who trace their ancestry back to Europe, and people who trace most of their ancestry back to sub-Saharan Africa, and people who trace most of their ancestry back to Asia, and people who trace their ancestry back to the early Americas, lived isolated from each other for long periods and have evolved different physical traits (curly hair, lighter skin, etc.)\n\nBut this theoretical definition (already fuzzy) wilts under human agency, in a real world where Kevin Garnett, Harold Ford, and Halle Berry all check \"black\" on the census. (Same deal for \"Hispanic.\") The reasons for that take us right back to the fact of race as a social construct. And an American-centered social construct. Are the Ainu of Japan a race? Should we delineate darker South Asians from lighter South Asians on the basis of race? Did the Japanese who invaded China consider the Chinese the same \"race\"?\n\nAndrew writes that liberals should stop saying \"truly stupid things like race has no biological element.\" I agree. Race clearly has a biological element- because we have awarded it one . Race is no more dependent on skin color today than it was on \"Frankishness\" in Emerson's day. Over history, race has taken geography, language, and vague impressions as its basis.\n\n\"Race,\" writes the great historian Nell Irvin Painter, \"is an idea, not a fact.\" Indeed. Race does not need biology. Race only requires some good guys with big guns looking for a reason."

While waiting in the coalition's lobby for an interview, a copy of a popular Time Magazine cover caught my eye. WE ARE AMERICANS , the cover read. The photo on the cover featured faces of various brown and yellow immigrants, eager and hopeful, representing both the spirit of America's revolutionary history and its inevitable future. I was remembering my own family's immigration when I stopped to wonder: Where are the Africans?\n\nU.S. immigration debates are overwhelmingly centered on immigrants from Latin America. Proportionately, Mexicans and central Americans far outnumber other immigrant groups in the United States. According to a Migration Policy Institute study, since 1970, \"a period during which the overall U.S. immigration population increased four-fold, the Mexican and central American population increased by a factor of 20.\" In a subsequent study on black immigration, the same organization reported that black African immigrants account for 3 percent of the total U.S. foreign-born population.\n\nLike their Latin American counterparts, African immigrants keep a low profile in an effort to avoid humiliation, deportation, and loss of work. Many of them, whether accidentally or otherwise, wind up blending in with African-American culture. But however closely they may identify with black America, they, too, are immigrants.\n\nTHE IRISH\n\nI recently read a book titled How The Irish Became White by Noel Ignatiev. Ignatiev traces this nation's white solidarity to the arrival of Irish settlers in New York in 1840, the country's subsequent disassociation from its African-American working class-and ultimately, from the African-American race.\n\nAccording to Ignatiev, Irish Catholics, then known as the blacks of Europe, came to America as a disenfranchised, oppressed race under the English Penal Laws. The greatest voice for Catholic emancipation at the time, Daniel O'Connell, urged the new immigrants to continue the struggle for equality in America by showing support for abolitionists. Instead, the Irish realized that discrimination against them by white elites was linked at least in part to their working, sleeping, and living closely alongside blacks of similar economic and social status.\n\nIn order to stand out from blacks economically, Irish immigrants had to monopolize their low-wage jobs and keep free Northern blacks from joining unions during the labor movement. And in order to disassociate socially, they had to consent to active participation in the oppression of the black race, embracing whiteness and the system that disenfranchised and justified an ungovernable hatred toward African-Americans.\n\nIgnatiev includes an 1843 letter from Daniel O'Connell: \"Over the broad Atlantic I pour forth my voice, saying, come out of such land, you Irishmen; or, if you remain, and dare countenance the system of slavery that is supported there, we will recognize you as Irishmen no longer.\"\n\nThe color of their skin saved them, but has also nearly obliterated a once-vibrant cultural identity so that today I know no Irishmen. I have friends of Irish descent, former co-workers who mentioned the occasional Irish grandfather, or associates who gesture toward familiarity of the lost heritage over empty pints on St. Patrick's Day-but the Irishmen are now white, and the Irishmen are now gone.\n\nRace in America is often thought of as a two-toned, immutable palette. No matter how early their ancestors arrived, Americans of Asian descent, Americans from Spanish-speaking countries, and Americans from the Middle East will always be considered foreign, it sometimes seems. For black immigrants who arrive as neither African-American nor white, affiliating with the African-American identity is often easier. Being considered African-American in this country is still better in most instances than being considered an immigrant.\n\nMuch as Irish immigrants benefited from the white racial umbrella, black immigrants are benefiting from a black racial umbrella. They cleave to African-American culture and identity groups and remain silent or unheard in the larger immigration dialogue. In the context of the immigration debate, while many of the prominent faces of those in need are often brown, it's worth remembering that the term immigrant captures black Africans, too. At the same time, black immigrants and their children are also helping to redefine what it means to be black in this country.\n\nON BEING BLACK\n\nWhen I was stopped in Arizona at a checkpoint during a midnight drive from Los Angeles to Houston, I was not asked if I was born in this country or if I was of legal status. The officer glanced at my license and simply asked me where I was going.\n\n\"Home,\" I answered. \"Back to Houston.\"\n\nI sounded like him and looked like about 14 percent of this country-so the officer let me pass. Someone like Natalie Portman-a white woman, but born in Jerusalem and an immigrant to the United States-might have had the same experience.\n\nIf Jose Antonio Vargas, the Pulitzer-winning journalist whose (brown) picture on the cover of Time hung on the wall of the New York Immigration Coalition, were stopped that night, he may have been interrogated with questions, squeezed for identification, for proof that he deserved to be here. How just is that?\n\nMy family left Liberia in 1990 amid the country's first civil war. We were among tens of thousands that successfully escaped to America. Five years old at the time, a green and frightened young immigrant, I moved with my growing family to three different states before settling in Houston in 1994. By then, my accent was gone. I pronounced the r 's at the ends of my words, I knew the radio music my elementary peers sang along to and I could quote the latest episodes of TGIF . By 2000, my only reference to Liberia, other than my parents, annual family reunions, and a war scar underneath my right foot was my name. I said it and people asked if I was African. If I did not say it, they could not know. We were the only African family in our small Texan town and as far as the residents were concerned-we were black. It was not until I moved to New York for college that my answer of \"Spring, Texas\" when people asked me where I was from was unacceptable. \"No,\" they would say, \"where are you from from?\" Oh. Liberia.\n\nLike a small percentage of Liberians, my recent ancestors were descendants of American slaves. A reverend by the name of June Moore immigrated to Liberia with his wife Adeline Moore in 1871. After settling in Arthington, Liberia, Wallace Moore, one of June's and Adeline's three sons, had a son named David Moore, who had a son named Herbert Moore, who had a son named Augustus Moore Sr.-my father.\n\nBut growing up in America as a black or white person encourages the abandonment of such history and the adoption of \"black\" or \"white\" American culture as one's own. Despite my Liberian heritage, my interactions outside of my house during my developmental years took place as though I were, culturally, an African-American-not an African. From first grade through high school, I received an American public-school education in which all mentions of people who looked like me were African-American. I took ownership of the culture because otherwise, I did not exist.\n\nWhen I was 11 years old, I was called a nigger at a neighborhood corner store by a shopkeeper who thought my friends and I were stealing from him when six or so of us entered his store after track practice. The word was foreign to me, as was his motivation in using it. My friends and I cried as we were chased out of the store, but even then I knew their tears came from a different, more familiar place.\n\nIn the same way we respond to someone with white skin-whether that person is a white European or a white Hispanic-so America responds to people with black skin, no matter if they have been here for 20 years or 200 years. Being black in America is accompanied by a stupefying consciousness, a sudden, lifelong awareness of your skin, your nose, your hair-all those things that, ironically, we are taught do not matter at all.\n\nPASSING\n\nStill, developing an awareness of all that being black in this country may entail does not automatically mean that young black immigrants are accepted by their peers. The young immigrant is usually subject to other kinds of bullying. National Geographic programming, comedians, and international news all showcase Africans as savage, disease-ridden, ignorant, and poor. As a young student in this country, an African student, there are few greater burdens than psychologically balancing the public's perception of Africa against what the immigrant knows to be true.\n\nSocial pressures cause a grave, hopeless desire to blend in with peers, even if the price is total rejection of the foods, music, and languages of that child's home country. The easiest avenue for assimilation into American culture, for young black immigrants, is the assimilation into African-American culture. African immigrants are not the only group to do this-Carribeans and black Hispanics may do this as well, all to ease the burdens of cultural ostracism.\n\nThese young people eventually learn to socially navigate both African-American and their home culture. This passing of black immigrants and first-generation black Americans as members of African-American culture results in a cross-cultural black identity, where the individual is equally invested in both African-American interests and the empowerment of their (or their parents') home country and the many issues that affect its native sons.\n\nMy father is a proud man. All of my uncles are proud men. They wear Liberia and her stories on their shoulders and made consistent attempts when I was growing up to engage us in her music and history. Still, my father was as careful as he was proud. My siblings and I were reminded to always obey the law, never get in trouble, to fear punishment and respect authority. The immigration struggles that face many Hispanics in this country-fear of prison, fear of deportation or separation from family-are more intensified among Africans, because many of us, my family included, left countries in conflict or at war. Drawing attention to your immigrant status means raising the possibility of having to return to a country whose economy and infrastructure may barely function.\n\nOurs is also a numbers game. As 3 percent of a foreign-born population, African influence in the immigration movement is low. Language barriers keep some black immigrants from becoming activists. It's not just about English; at one information session in the Bronx, instructions and information on legal clinic appointments were given only in Spanish, even though 10 percent of the attendants were black immigrants who mostly spoke French. The Francophones had to consult with one another to figure out what the session leader was saying.\n\nSome black immigrants are vocal and have received help from a few quarters. To people of countries beset by armed conflict, natural disaster, or other circumstances that would make going home unsafe, the United States grants what's called Temporary Protected Status (TPS). TPS gives certain foreign nationals a special opportunity to live in America, to work, to pay taxes, and to own homes and businesses. Haitians benefited from this after the 2010 earthquake, and Liberians were also beneficiaries.\n\nBut in 2007, an estimated 4,000 Liberians were told that their special status would expire on September 30 at midnight. On September 12, however, President George W. Bush signed a bill that gave the Liberians permission to stay another 18 months and continue working. That reprieve has since been granted four times; yet every year these Liberians-some with children who are American citizens, homeowners, and taxpayers-face the threat of deportation.\n\nLiberian nationals, with the help of the Universal Human Rights International Group and community associations led and managed by fellow Liberian immigrants, continue to lobby Congress for permanent residency. Michael Capuano, a Democratic U.S. congressman from Massachusetts, is a co-sponsor of the Liberian Refugee Immigration Protection Act. If passed, the bipartisan bill will allow Liberians with TPS to apply for permanent residency, something they are not currently allowed to do.\n\nYou may have passed a Liberian covered by TPS today. You may have thought that he was just black.\n\nWhat the Irish were to white identity in the 19th century, so are African immigrants to African-American identity today. Black immigrants have a meaningful contribution to make to the immigration debate; for Jose Antonio Vargas and the other brown faces on that Time cover, the black immigrant voice may be all the push reformists need."

      "text": "Why You Can't Tell the Truth About Race\n\nSpecial Correspondent\n\nSo here's the climate we're operating in, in three little Senate campaign vignettes.\n\nMitch McConnell sends out a mailer to eastern Kentucky voters that is obviously a voter-suppression device, designed to confuse voters into thinking that they'll be breaking the law if they cast ballots. He has been criticized, and Alison Lundergan Grimes's campaign is suing, but in all likelihood it's going to work, and he's not only going to get away with it but this candidate who is actively trying to depress the vote in a part of his state will be the new majority leader of the Senate next January.\n\nMeanwhile, Iowans are about to send a serious extremist to the Senate. Joni Ernst's positions have been well-catalogued, but somehow neither the cataloguing nor her blowing off the editorial board of the Des Moines Register is going to hurt her, and she is about to join the same federal government that she has declared is not safe from her \"beautiful little Smith & Wesson.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut down in Louisiana, what happens when Mary Landrieu gently suggests that maybe race has a little something to do with Barack Obama's unpopularity in Louisiana? \"The South has not always been the friendliest place for African-Americans,\" Landrieu remarked to NBC News last Thursday. \"It's been a difficult time for the president to present himself in a very positive light as a leader.\" She's getting hammered for it. It's still a decent bet that her contest against Bill Cassidy will go to a run-off, but he's ahead of her a few points in most polls, which means that'll be a really hard run-off for her to win.\n\nSo you can blatantly try to suppress the vote. You can hide your extreme views and duck from having to answer questions about them. You can do all kinds of things that some of these candidates have done. Remember Ben Sasse, who is going to be the new senator from Nebraska? He said that religious freedom trumps government to such an extent that the gummint \"cannot force citizens to violate their religious beliefs under any circumstances.\" We've forgotten all about this guy, because it's Nebraska, and the race isn't anywhere near close, but you might want to start remembering his name. He's going to be among the most radical of the new crop of senators. When I asked a tea-party insider recently which Senate races were most important to his movement, he named Sasse first.\n\nSo there are a lot of things candidates can get away with saying and doing this election cycle. But there's one thing you can't do: mildly say anything that resembles the truth about race in America.\n\nI'm not saying, and Landrieu wasn't saying, that race explains all antipathy toward Obama in Louisiana. She invoked his opposition to drilling. But can anyone argue with a straight face that racism is not a factor at all in how some white voters feel about Obama in some states? No person who truly believed such a thing would be worth taking seriously. And look at how mild her phrasing was: The South \"has not always been the friendliest place\" for black people.\n\nIf someone said Eastern Europe had not always been the friendliest place for Jews, no one would bat an eye, and in fact the person would -- if anything -- be criticized for dealing in mealy-mouthed euphemism. And yet, when it comes to our own South, we have to pretend somehow that racism plays no role whatsoever in white Louisianans' assessment of the president.\n\nGee, let's see. Why did Louisiana give Obama his second-lowest level of white-voter support in 2012, at 10.5 percent, just behind (you guessed it) Mississippi? It just so happens that of the 10 states where Obama had his lowest levels of white support, eight are in the old Confederacy (the other two are Wyoming and Utah). And no, again, I wouldn't say it's all racism. But it's far more absurd to say that racism plays no role. And after the 2016 election, come to think of it, we'll have a crude way to measure it, once we can compare Obama's white totals in these states to Hillary Clinton's.\n\nIt all adds up to a pretty great situation-for the racists. They get to be racist, and then when a politician very gingerly suggests that racism exists, they get to take roaring umbrage. And by and large, they get the mainstream media to take their side! Because Landrieu's remarks, you see, are \"divisive\" (so said Bobby Jindal among others). Note that. It's not the reality of the racism that's divisive. It's softly pointing out that it exists that gets called divisive.\n\nWe haven't discussed it much this election, but obviously Obama's race is a factor in these Senate elections. How big a factor? We can't know, and it varies from state to state-probably much more of a factor in Landrieu's Louisiana than in Colorado or Iowa, say. You can bet it's helping McConnell; he probably knows by how much to the tenth of a percentage point.\n\nSomething else that doesn't get discussed a lot is the fact that many matters of public concern are deeply and permanently racialized in this country. Laced into the hatred of Obamacare is to some extent an assumption that it's basically for black people (the uninsured and the poor are presumed to be disproportionately black). Approval numbers on Obamacare by race are harder to come by than you'd think, but about a year ago just 29 percent of whites approved of it. That's even less than the percentage of whites (39) who voted for Obama in 2012.\n\nRace is also embedded in the whole set of presumptions about the 47 percent and the \"moocher class.\" This is an emotional posture that, again, hasn't gotten a lot of attention this election cycle, because no bartender caught a Republican candidate on tape complaining about the moochers, but the belief is deeply held by Republican voters (and some independents), and it's very racially coded.\n\nSo just as it is often said that the whole black race is on trial when a high-profile black defendant faces prosecution, we can say that once again the black race is on the ballot, for the fourth and (for the foreseeable future) final time. And it's going to finish a two-two draw. Somehow, the white race, and especially the racists within it, are never on the ballot. It literally took a member of the Ku Klux Klan almost becoming governor (David Duke) for racism to become an openly acknowledged issue. That, of course, happened in Louisiana. I'm sure it's just a coincidence.\n\nAnd as for Landrieu, as I said, it seems to look still as if her contest is headed to a run-off. Cassidy has hit 50 in a couple of recent polls, though he averages 48, 49. If he vaults over the big five-oh tomorrow, I think we'll know why.\n\nSpecial Correspondent\n\nmichael.tomasky@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "I Experienced Systemic Racism at One of America's Most Prestigious Magazines\n\nAs a magazine, Town & Country has been in circulation longer than the institution of slavery has been abolished in America. In the past few years, the 174-year-old Hearst publication has made it a point to assert itself as an important voice in our country's national reckoning with race, equity, and social justice.\n\nThe \"advancing conversations\" featured at the affluent heritage brand's annual event, the Town & Country Philanthropy Summit , for example, have tackled issues from mass incarceration to police violence, and have featured a who's who of Black powerhouses from Valerie Jarrett, Darren Walker, John Legend, and Ava DuVernay, to Michael B. Jordan, Robert F. Smith, Yara Shahidi, and the Exonerated Five.\n\nBehind the scenes, however, in the company's offices and hiring practices, a very different story emerges-one that has all the hallmarks of deep-seated systemic racism and bias.\n\nDespite an outward commitment to \"upholding a diverse and inclusive point of view,\" as outlined in a recent company statement, there are exactly zero people of color, including no Black/African Americans, on the Town & Country top executive team. Under that team, the virtually all-white full-time staff, contractors, and suppliers are perpetuated by biased recruitment, hiring, and procurement processes that suppress opportunities for Black/African American people.\n\nI know this first-hand, as a Black woman, because I was denied opportunities for advancement at Town & Country . (\"While there are current full-time Town & Country staffers with diverse underrepresented identities on both the editorial and sales and marketing teams, we are actively working to have more proportionate race and ethnic representatives supporting our brands , \" a Hearst Magazines spokesperson said in a statement.)\n\nI first walked into the Town & Country office in 2016. My company, production by HUMAN INTONATION, was contracted as an event supplier, and I took on a support role to manage guest relations for the magazine's Philanthropy Summit. Stellene Volandes had just been appointed as T&C 's new editor-in-chief.\n\nI was immediately and acutely aware that I was the only visible Black person contracted on the project. Not only that-I then realized I was the only visible person of color contracted on the project, and I saw no other contractors or suppliers of color over the next four years.\n\nDuring this period, each time I became aware of newly filled positions at Town & Country -whether full-time or contractors-I observed the magazine had consistently hired a white candidate (frequently, but not exclusively, female and blond), with few exceptions. When the magazine's publisher Jennifer Levene-Bruno was in need of a new executive assistant, a blonde white woman was hired. A new senior marketing coordinator: blonde white woman. A new brand marketing director: blonde white woman. And so on.\n\nFollowing the 2017 Philanthropy Summit, the full-time staff member who led the event's annual production-with whom I worked over the previous two years-prepared to leave Town & Country that September. The magazine decided to transition that vacant lead producer role from an on-staff position to a contract-based one. Knowing the job would become outsourced, before leaving the magazine, the departing staff member directly recommended my company to Town & Country's branding executive Jennifer Orr and her team for the contracted role. With over a decade of event production experience as the executive producer of conferences, panels, and large-scale fundraising galas, I was qualified to lead the charge, and gladly accepted her recommendation. I was excited to explore the opportunity with Orr and her team.\n\nOver the next five months, however, my emails and calls to inquire about the guidelines to submit a formal proposal, or to schedule a meeting regarding my business leading the production of the Philanthropy Summit, were met with vague, coldly corporate emails like: \"...[We] aren't clear yet about activations.\" Each time I reached out, I was asked to follow-up again in a few months. By January 2018, I received an offer to continue in the same support role for guest relations. When I inquired once again about the lead producer opportunity, it was expressed to me, \"We already have a plan in place for the workload for the rest of the Summit but if anything changes, we will let you know.\" That plan? The full-time staff producer role previously filled by a blonde, white woman-who recommended my company-was replaced with a contracted producer, who you may have guessed is... a blonde, white woman.\n\nLet's take a pause. The incident described here is not only about me being passed over without consideration and not getting the business. Instead, what it illustrates is something that many heritage media brands like Town & Country are now forced to reckon with: systemic recruitment and procurement practices that routinely exclude or ignore qualified Black applicants, while effectively prioritizing the maintenance of a homogenous, white-centric organizational culture.\n\nToo often Black/African American candidates or suppliers are denied the opportunity to apply, or to even submit a proposal, for jobs. While the New York State Human Rights Law protects contractors from unlawful discrimination, and the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission states that \"An employer may not refuse to give employment applications to people of a certain race,\" such practices continue today under many guises including closed referral networks, discriminatory \"preferred vendor\" programs, and other forms of institutional biases.\n\nThe Partnership for New York City released a June 2020 open letter calling for united efforts to achieve racial equity, including \"helping racially diverse entrepreneurs and small businesses survive.\" The letter was signed by 191 of the city's top business leaders from all sectors of the economy. While Hearst President & CEO Steven R. Swartz, co-chair of the Partnership for New York City, supported the letter as a signatory, I question how many other qualified suppliers and contractors of color have been passed over without full consideration throughout Town & Country's 174 years (Swartz did not respond to a request for an interview when I reached out in August).\n\nNot receiving full or serious consideration for a project is a scenario faced by many Black-owned event suppliers and contractors. In a June 2020 article for BizBash , seasoned events producer and chief experience officer Yvonne McNair wrote: \"The meeting and events industry accounts for over $325 billion of direct spending, yet Black event professionals are often overlooked. We are not seeing representation when it comes to the leadership positions at top brands or when it comes to hiring event agencies or freelancers. Additionally, when hired, we are often provided lower event budgets and tasked with creating the same level or better experiences as our white peers.\"\n\nThis last line rings particularly true.\n\nPrior to the current movement for racial equity and economic justice, marked by the police killing of George Floyd , I remained quiet when pressured by Town & Country to perform my services a solid $5,000 below my standard consulting rate, whereas I was paid my full rate for similar projects I produced at peer publications and comparable media organizations in New York City. As recent as 2019, I was told by Town & Country's brand marketing director, Sarah Ryan Clausen, that there are \"so many people interested in taking your spot who would be happy to do it for less.\"\n\nSystemic racism in this country has taught me and many others to swallow discriminatory slights-including pay inequity-and that I am supposed to feel lucky that a brand like Town & Country would even entertain working with me at all. I often worked outside of my contracted hours throughout my four-year experience with the magazine; I did so as a courtesy, including several hours of my time that I gave pro bono when called upon to assist Clausen with guest-relations details in the final weeks leading up to the 2020 Philanthropy Summit, for which my company was not contracted this year. When I originally reached out regarding the summit this past February, I was told by Clausen that my services were not needed.\n\nAs I watched all four days of the virtual 2020 Town & Country Philanthropy Summit from July 7 to 10, I listened to the likes of Ava DuVernay and Ford Foundation President Darren Walker call on each of us, attendee and host, particularly those in positions of privilege, \"to engage in the concrete work of reconciliation.\"\n\nAfter hearing this, I finally woke up. Recognizing the depth of the disparity between what I was hearing and the reality of my experience with Town & Country , I found myself searching throughout the event for some form of proactive dialogue about the internal changes and actions the magazine would undertake to address its internal racial inequity and biases, whether conscious or unconscious. I heard none.\n\nFeeling moved not only to write about my experience, but also to explore the challenges of achieving reconciliation, I reached out to the magazine's current Editor-in-Chief Stellene Volandes on July 22 with the opportunity for us to collaborate on my unpacking-in article form-the chasm between Town & Country's outward commitment to racial equality and the brand's actual, internal racial disparities. I sought to understand what material action the brand was taking.\n\nOur first (and only) follow-up phone call took place the next day, which shockingly was the same day The New York Times reported on allegations of a culture of sexual harassment and a toxic workplace under Troy Young, then-president of Hearst Magazines, T&C 's parent company-in addition to accusations of racial discrimination at publications under his watch, specifically Cosmopolitan and Marie Claire .\n\nDuring our call, my idea was initially met with enthusiasm from Volandes, who seemed to exude a willingness for her and the Town & Country team to self-examine in ways that would perhaps be unprecedented for the brand, and for the larger media industry. Volandes suggested I write the article for Town & Country .\n\nOur conversation ended with Volandes putting me in touch with the Town & Country PR team, Randi Friedman, executive director of public relations, and Gabriel Ford, then the senior PR director for Hearst Magazines, to schedule interviews for my article with various executives at the magazine while she was on vacation. I had a call with Ford where I reiterated my intention to produce an article about the disparities in Town & Country 's commitment to racial equity. Ultimately, the PR team gave little attention or priority to the task. Instead, upon the top editor's return, I received several vague corporate statements reaffirming the magazine's \"commitment\" to racial equity, with Volandes expressing, \"I am proud of the ways in which we have examined and evolved conversations around the urgent topics our nation faces in the magazine and at our events as well as within the editorial team I have built and continue to build.\"\n\nOur interviews went unscheduled. I was eventually given a final corporate statement, attributed to a Hearst Magazines spokesperson, reading: \"As a company, we are examining our culture, practices and products, with a focus on respecting, protecting and representing diversity and inclusion, and improving the pipeline for diverse talent through augmented recruiting initiatives, more accountability during the hiring process and partnerships with organizations including YearUp, AdCOLOR and the T. Howard Foundation. Town & Country advances important conversations around philanthropy and its staff is deeply committed to the social causes the brand champions. Through allyship, education and action, the team is always working to represent the values they believe in so strongly.\"\n\nI was-for all intents and purposes-blown off.\n\nThe presence of white privilege and white supremacy delusion are seemingly so insidious and ingrained in Town & Country , one cannot forget its multi-century success is built on the generational wealth of white American families in the landed aristocracy . Descendants of slave traders and plantation owners with recurring appearances on the Social Register , have long been the subject of society-news-turned-philanthropic-pageantry predating the early 1900s. Former President of Hearst Magazines, David Carey, referred to it as Town & Country's \" illustrious history .\" Meanwhile, Town & Country's exploitation of Black celebrities, contributors, and influencers, has long been a strategy to bring new life to the outdated, white-centric, heritage brand.\n\nBlack people are the definitive hot sauce on an otherwise bland white America. In the 1990s and early 2000s, former Editor in Chief Pamela Fiori turned to increasing diversity to revitalize Town & Country's waning circulation and stale societal commentary. On diversity, Fiori stated in a 2003 interview, \"I don't want to change the world, but I would like to change the magazine. And change the universe that our readers live in. I think it's a much more interesting world. I think it's a lot more fun. I think it's certainly a lot more fascinating.\"\n\nThis fascination without interest in real, substantive action for change is still being exploited by Town & Country today. As proof of the magazine's commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, Volandes referenced to me in our email exchange that \"this commitment is one I hope is evident in our September issue,\" an issue featuring stunning images of actress Kerry Washington as its cover story, and a number of Black/African American-focused editorials.\n\nWhat I found evident in the September 2020 issue, however, is a history of exploitation much like the one depicted by Washington's 2012 role in Django Unchained . Town & Country preyed on the artistic feat that Washington, stylist Law Roach , and photographers AB + DM achieved with their creative genius, like puppeteers pulling the strings of marionettes for the entertainment of the Town & Country reader, not much unlike the white oppressors exposing Broomhilda von Shaft's whipped-keloid back at the dinner table. Without the eradication of its systemic practices internally, Town & Country's outward championing of racial equity-and the public promotion of Black talent, contributors, and influencers-is nothing more than a well-crafted, exploitive marketing strategy with no commitment or actionable investment in the Black/African American community.\n\nThe \"advancing conversations\" over the last five years of the Philanthropy Summit have made no impact in Town & Country's own contribution to ending the racial injustice that requires these conversations in the first place. It gives all others in white media a green light to gloss over difficult conversations and substantive, systemic change with curated images of Black/African American talent, contributors, and influencers across their pages. This is not anti-racism.\n\nFrom the outset of my time contracted with Town & Country , I received a familiar unspoken message. Like many predominantly white corporate offices in America , Town & Country is a place where I, as a Black person-particularly the only Black contractor-can stay, as long as I make everyone else feel comfortable with my being there. Whether I belonged at Town & Country would be determined by how I presented myself, and whether I dressed and spoke in ways that the virtually all-white team deemed a \"cultural fit.\" There was no space for me to simply be myself. It was my responsibility to assimilate , and I obliged.\n\nFor the first two years I consulted on the Philanthropy Summit, I felt invisible. By year three, Levene-Bruno, the magazine's publisher, was still re-introducing herself to me as if it was the first time we had ever met regardless of the number of one-on-one meetings she and I had had over the previous two years. Bias revealed itself in the form of condescending tones from team members and the other consultants on the project. I felt it when I was being overly scrutinized or it was suggested that I was not capable of doing the work, continuously having to prove myself year after year. Almost immediately, the contracted lead producer who had been brought in began to address me, both verbally and in email, with a condescending tone, demanding information outside of my contracted scope, as if I was her personal assistant. I watched as the team interacted with the freelance graphic artist who had replaced the in-house creative director (both blond, white women) very differently and in a much gentler manner than they did towards me.\n\nAt this point, it became evident I could not possibly be the only one who had these types of experiences.\n\nThere were no Black/African American-owned production partners publicly listed for the 2020 Philanthropy Summit. In my last year as a contractor, I met one lone Black male editorial assistant on Town & Country's full-time staff. I immediately wondered: What investment is Town & Country making to ensure this young professional has an equitable opportunity for mentorship and growth that levels the playing field for advancement in his career? As it turned out, the answer to this question is none.\n\nFor seven of the eight-and-a-half years of his tenure, the former editorial assistant-who spoke on the condition of anonymity-was the one and only full-time Black employee at Town & Country . A graduate of Howard University, he expressed an understanding of the importance of a strong work ethic, often coming in early, doing more work than he was being paid for, receiving positive performance reviews, and continuing to take on more responsibilities including tasks and markets that would normally comprise the role of an associate, full-time, or senior editor. The former editorial assistant expressed that part of him really loved working at the magazine, particularly at the beginning of his career. In fact, from 2011 to 2015, he found there were editors who supported his ideas and talked about his growth. He recalled developing positive relationships with former Editor-in-Chief Jay Fielden and former Creative Director Alexandra Kotur. However, as the leadership of both Town & Country and Hearst Magazines changed in the latter half of the 2010s, there was an insidious energy shift, the ex-staffer expressed.\n\nHe recalled watching white team members who started jobs at the magazine after him be promoted before him; hearing from colleagues that he was being paid less than his white counterparts; and feeling the pressure of representing the entire Black race-both in the office and with external T&C partners. With the exception of a lateral move as a fashion assistant, he never once received a promotion himself over the near-decade he spent at the magazine. When he inquired about being promoted or receiving a pay raise, he recalled being consistently told \"just wait a few more issues\" or \"we're already planning to bring someone [else] in.\" He said he was never given concrete reasons for why he was not being promoted. During his time, the former editorial assistant never saw any Black editors at Town & Country. In his role, he pushed for Black/African American fashion and jewelry designers to be shown in the magazine-while knowing they often would not be picked, he was doing his part to give exposure to Black brands.\n\nOver time, the demoralization took its toll. The Black ex-staffer recalled coming to terms with having been conditioned to the inherently racist construct of \"at least I am in the room\" and \"at least Black stories are being told\" at the virtually all-white magazine. He knew something was holding him back from advancement other than the quality of his work or his experience, reflecting that \"because I wasn't a white woman, I didn't get the same opportunities.\" Once he saw no upward trajectory for himself at the company, he resigned in 2019. \"It just wasn't fair, and you could not show me or prove to me how it was,\" he said of his experience at Town & Country .\n\nPerhaps some will conclude that this former staffer should have done more to make his case known, voicing his concerns about bias to his supervisor or to Hearst's human-resources team. But that more than likely would not have helped.\n\nAnother Black ex-Hearst staffer, who spoke with me on the condition of anonymity, recalled how raising issues of bias to their supervisor was met with indifference, and inappropriate responses from Hearst's HR team. The ex-employee, once an associate director of events at the mass-media giant, expressed how they too found the expectation to adjust-as the only Black person on an otherwise all-white Hearst strategic marketing team-was placed solely on them. Even as their supervisor acknowledged the examples they provided of racial bias and a lack of inclusivity, they recalled being told, \"you seem intimidated by us\" and \"I was hoping to hire someone just like me.\" They too received dismissive, demoralizing emails including one that bluntly read: \"I disagree with your assessment that our team is not inclusive, collaborative, efficient.\"\n\nFurther exemplifying the organizational culture operating not only at Town & Country , but Hearst at large, this ex-staffer felt judged not by whether they did the job well, but by how great was their ability to assure their white team members that they as a Black person would uphold the department's status quo-to not interrupt its culture of white privilege.\n\nUltimately, after multiple attempts to find resolution with Hearst human-resources about their increasingly challenged experience at the company, the HR team concluded there was, \"no evidence of unconscious bias or that [you are] being treated unfairly or differently because of [your] race, gender, or any other reason.\"\n\nAnd so this Black staffer, too, resigned from the company in order to-as they expressed-maintain their mental health and overall wellbeing. \"I had to identify very early on (within 6 months) that I needed to move on and that I would be ok,\" the ex-Hearst employee said.\n\nThe challenges of reconciliation are not unique or singular to Town & Country . Even when an organization believes itself to be well-intentioned, the resistance to the work required to achieve reconciliation is first and foremost rooted in systemic racism. While the opportunity for my collaborative work with the magazine has been deferred, perhaps not all is lost.\n\nThere is opportunity for the Town & Country team and countless other media leaders to begin the process of reconciliation to achieve racial equity now. As the Black Lives Matter movement continues, I am calling on Town & Country to truly become anti-racist. As Darren Walker called out at the 2020 Town & Country Philanthropy Summit: \"This is no longer time for amelioration, or token approaches at systemic challenges.\" I am calling for Town & Country's internal leadership, editors, staff, contractors and suppliers to become a reflection of the Black talent placed on its covers, the Black figures that dominate the speakers roster selected for their events, and the messages of racial equity the magazine consistently uplifts on its platforms.\n\nOne concrete step would be for Town & Country to be transparent about its specific employee demographics, and to publicly share the magazine's action plan to address its racial inequities as other Hearst publications have done, such as Cosmopolitan's \" Cosmo Can Do Better-Here's Our Action Plan \" published in June 2020. We are calling for Town & Country to make a true, accountable investment in Black/African Americans and level the playing field with equitable compensation and spending; a redistribution of decision-making power through leadership roles; and opportunities for advancement in hiring and promotions. This is a level of public accountability that not only requires brands like Town & Country and others to hold themselves accountable, but each of us-white, Black, indigenous, and all people of color-to understand and recognize our empowerment and responsibility going forward to end the exploitation of Black/African Americans in the media and events industries.\n\nI thought long and hard about the risk I would be taking by putting pen to paper to share my experience at Town & Country . It is with a fear for my safety, wellbeing, and career sustainability that more than one of my mentors, primarily Black, cautioned: \"You can't speak your truth, they won't hire you again.\"\n\nIn the end, I am taking the risk of speaking up not for myself but for all the editorial staffers, suppliers, consultants, and serially untapped, underutilized team members who look like me to have a different experience going forward.\n\nMy only choice was to press on with the fortitude of the Black suffragettes , the inspiration of Kamala Harris' unprecedented run , and John Lewis' iconic final words held tightly to my chest. I am answering the highest calling of my heart and standing up for what I truly believe, Mr. Lewis-let's get in good trouble.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "How Low Will the GOP Go to Keep These Black Women Off the Bench?\n\nRepublicans will face a dilemma this week when the Senate Judiciary Committee considers two of President Biden's priority picks for the federal court, both Black women with impeccable credentials. Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is slated to fill Merrick Garland's former seat on the U.S. District Court of Appeals, often a stepping stone to the Supreme Court . And Candace Jackson-Akiwumi, nominated for the Seventh Circuit, would be only the third federal appellate court judge in history to have spent a majority of their career as a public defender.\n\nBoth women fit the model of new judges Biden has talked about to bring more diversity in terms of both race and professional backgrounds to a federal bench grown top-heavy with prosecutors trained in punitive justice and partners from big law firms whose world view doesn't see past corporate America.  And their qualifications cannot be assailed-at least not fairly. Republicans have already twice voted to confirm Judge Jackson, 50, a Harvard Law grad: as vice-chair of the U.S. Sentencing Commission in 2010, where she oversaw the reduction of sentences for crack cocaine and other drug-related offenses, and then to the U.S. District Court in 2013.\n\nJackson-Akiwumi, 41, is currently with a major law firm where she focuses on white collar criminal defense, but before that, from 2010 to 2020, she was a public defender in Chicago, a job she described on the website of Yale Law School, her alma mater, as having \"meaning to me. I provide quality representation to people who would not be able to afford it, and I am there for clients at a most dreary and frightening juncture: when they are being judged for the worst day or days in their life.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAll of that may not be enough to protect these women about to receive lifetime appointments to positions of great power from Republicans who notably saved their most pointed attacks on Biden's executive branch nominees for women and persons of color.\n\nFilling out the slate of five nominees set to testify Wednesday before the Judiciary committee are two for the District Court in New Jersey, including a magistrate judge and former federal prosecutor, Zahid N. Quraishi, a Muslim American of Pakistani descent, and Regina Rodriguez for the District Court in Colorado, whose nomination drew early fire from progressives .\n\nPerhaps because Republicans can't honestly make the case that Democratic nominees are wildly outside the mainstream, the way many of Donald Trump's nominees who Mitch McConnell pushed through were, conservative advocacy groups have already mounted an ad campaign against Democrats taking \"dark money\" and rewarding \"secret donors\" to advance judges from the \"radical left\" who will supposedly rubberstamp Biden's agenda. But the ads are so generic the scripts could have been written by Democrats complaining about GOP judges.\n\nDemocrats point to Republican Senator John Cornyn's recent grilling of Kristen Clarke, nominee for assistant attorney general, on a letter she wrote as a 19-year-old undergrad at Harvard about the superiority of the Black race, which was intended to spoof The Bell Curve , a hugely controversial book that tried to link race with intelligence and that was co-authored by a Harvard professor. Cornyn seemed to have thought he'd uncovered Clarke's Black supremacist past 25 years later, only to drop the line of questioning after Clarke explained that it was, in fact, a parody and that it had been reported on at the time as one.\n\n\"These nominees come before the committee with sterling reputations and unquestionable credentials in the law,\" Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse, a member of the Judiciary Committee, told The Daily Beast in an email. \"I hope my Republican colleagues learned a lesson from their regrettable performance at the Clarke and (Vanita) Gupta  hearings and treat these nominees with respect.  The right-wing donors funding attacks against Biden Justice nominees will no doubt encourage outbursts directed at judicial candidates; Republicans would be better off ignoring that encouragement.\"\n\nThe Judiciary committee has not yet voted on Clarke's nomination to head the civil rights division at the Justice Department. Gupta was confirmed last week for the No. 3 position at Justice with a 51-49 vote as Republican Lisa Murkowski joined all Democrats. Gupta withstood a brutal campaign of misinformation led by Cornyn, who called her a liar for denying she ever supported the decriminalization of all drugs. He relied for his false claim on a 2012 editorial in which she said simple possession should be decriminalized.\n\nHer alleged support for defunding the police was another favorite GOP trope. She said in her testimony before the Judiciary Committee that political leaders should \"heed calls from Black Lives Matter and Movement for Black Lives activists to decrease police budgets and the scope, role and responsibility of police in our lives.\" Republican Ted Cruz, among others, said that was the same as defunding the police altogether. But it was Cornyn who had the biggest burr under his saddle, going back to 2003 when Gupta, then a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, uncovered dozens of fabricated drug charges brought against mainly Black men in Tulia, Texas, while Cornyn was state attorney general-an embarrassment on his watch that apparently left him with a score to settle despite letters of support for Gupta from leading law enforcement groups that Republicans used to care about and take their marching orders from.\n\nThe question now with the first of Biden's judges coming under scrutiny, will the Republicans be able to find pay dirt as they mount their attacks-or will they just make stuff up?\n\nDan Goldberg, legal director at the Alliance for Justice, a liberal advocacy group, notes that when his group and others on the left went after President Trump's judicial nominees, they did deep dives into their judicial record if there was one, their writings going back to college, and their social media profiles. \"When we appraised Trump judges, we were able to point to their writings and decisions that turned back the clock, and we haven't seen that here yet,\" he said, with Republicans just launching loose attacks instead. But while Democrats managed to pick off a few conspicuously unqualified nominees, Trump succeeded in getting over 200 mostly white, mostly male conservative judges confirmed, including nearly as many (54) to the powerful Court of Appeals as the 55 his predecessor, Barack Obama, got in eight years.\n\nBeginning this week, Democrats plan hearings every other week in an effort to confirm judges on a pace comparable to what Trump managed when he had the White House and Republicans controlled the Senate. Biden has over a hundred vacancies to fill, including 13 on Circuit courts and 85 on District courts-a number big enough to offer an alternative ledger of justice more suited to a rapidly changing world. If Democrats stick together and their 50-seat margin holds, they can impact the courts just like Trump did.\n\neleanor.clift@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "After Trayvon, Conservatives Discover Black-on-Black Violence\n\nThe killing of Trayvon Martin has focused the attention of conservatives on the high rate of homicides in urban communities, but only as a means of deflecting attention away from George Zimmerman. Right-wing commentators have suddenly become deeply concerned with black-on-black street killings, asking why we're being \"distracted\" by Martin . This ignores the obvious: everyone knows who Trayvon's killer is, and he has yet to be arrested.\n\nConservatives peddling this line are trying to suggest that young blacks are intrinsically equipped to fail and to damage one another and that blacks don't care when young blacks are done in by other blacks. All of this is simply untrue and mean-spirited.\n\nAs Randall Robinson wrote, \"There's nothing wrong with us, something was done to us.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThat \"something\" was more than 300 years of the most inhumane and brutal form of slavery ever perpetrated by one group of human beings on another. And the remnants of those dark centuries still haunt blacks here in America in the form of abject poverty, low achievement, and endemic violence in poor communities. While neither the current generation of whites nor their parents or grandparents participated in the brutality perpetrated by their more-distant ancestors, many continue to benefit from its effects, and not nearly enough have engaged in any efforts to ameliorate the lingering effects of slavery. A debt is owed to blacks, even if it's uncollectible and never paid.\n\nNo group of people ever willingly allows its young people to devour themselves as senselessly as young black males are currently doing in America. These youths are drowning in a perfect storm of neglect, poverty, and mindless violence. If there were an easy solution to the high rate of violence among young men of color, the elders of the black community, criminologists, and social scientists would have \"solved\" the problem decades ago.\n\nBut if pointed barbs from small-minded conservative commentators are what it takes to spur the country into action, then so be it. The point is to solve the problem and not play petty politics with young black lives.\n\nSome potential short-term solutions: In more enlightened countries, poor people are paid to see doctors, because it's cheaper to keep people from getting sick than to have to pay for emergency care once they are seriously ill. Other countries are experimenting with the idea of paying addicts to stay clean. Death is costly. So why not take the fundamentally conservative idea that people respond to marginal economic incentives and apply it to the intractable problem of black youth violence?\n\nOne potential answer is paying students for earning good grades. All parents capable of doing so already engage in the practice in one form or another, but parents without the financial wherewithal or resources cannot use this simple carrot-and-stick approach, which has achieved remarkable success in Brazil, where it's a government policy, and some promising results in New York City, where a privately funded pilot program has tested the idea. I've had an educator tell me that he was \"philosophically opposed\" to paying kids to get good grades-so I suppose he expected children from disadvantaged backgrounds, where there's no family tradition of education, to become good students because it's the right thing to do.\n\nStaying with money, adults need to understand that it's tough being broke in an iPad world. Young blacks, like everyone else in our society, are bombarded with messages telling them what they absolutely need to have, and absent a legitimate method of acquiring such \"things\"-basic necessities of adolescence, if you stop and think about it-they will resort to illegitimate methods.\n\nPetty drug dealers, attempting to make a few bucks in one of the few ways readily available to them in the ghetto, get shot when something goes awry over amounts of money so small it's truly laughable, if not for the fact some kid died. Thus, paying students-even a small amount-can potentially make a huge difference in the inner-city crime rate. We cannot afford not to come up with the funds to do so on a broader scale.\n\nIn underclass urban communities, 29-year-old grandmothers are expected to help their teenaged children to successfully raise the next generation-and in most cases it quite simply can't be done. The answer lies in programs similar to the Harlem Children's Zone, where stable adults take young mothers by the hand and show them, step by step, day in and day out, how to raise their offspring. The mentoring is so intense that both the mother and child are being raised at the same instant. The success rate for such programs is well-documented, but the downside is such programs take time, political will, and an investment of capital (all of which we in America seem in short supply of). We can't find the money to save children of the underclass, but we damn sure will find the money to lock them up and further disenfranchise them when they act out as adults.\n\nGeoffrey Canada, the head of the Harlem Children's Zone, has been successful because of the large amounts of money he has been able to raise in wealthy New York City. If wealthy black entertainers, athletes, and businesspeople followed the example of \"bad boy\" football player Braylon Edwards, who established a charity to assist students in Cleveland (and has maintained his commitment to these kids even after he was traded), programs like Canada's could spring up across the country-and the back of the beast of urban violence could be broken in one generation. I know that other blacks of means are doing some good with their wealth, but it's simply not enough. How can they expect whites to shoulder the burden for the uplifting of the black race when so many blacks of means are stuck-like spoiled children-in the cult of celebrity? Perhaps Barack and Michelle Obama should have these folks to dinner at the White House after the election and do some serious arm twisting.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Reports of the Death of Jim Crow Prove Greatly Exaggerated\n\nWho was-who is-Jim Crow? For the record, he is both much less and much more than a man. In 1828, an elderly black stableman, the property of a Kentuckian named Crow, performed an act that caught the eye of the white minstrel Thomas \"Daddy\" Rice. After blackening his face with burnt cork and dressing in tattered rags, a grinning Rice mimicked the stableman's act, dancing and singing in black dialect:\n\nWeel about, and turn about\n\nAnd do jis so;\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEb'ry time I weel about,\n\nI jump Jim Crow.\n\nWhite audiences loved the act, minstrelsy became America's most popular form of mass entertainment, and \"Jim Crow\" entered the national vernacular. Things got even uglier in the 1890s, for reasons that remain muddy, when Jim Crow became much more than a degrading caricature. He became synonymous with the viciously enforced laws that separated and subjugated black people across the South.\n\nEven today, myths endure about that old brute Jim Crow. One of the most cherished is that he died when the civil rights movement culminated in passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a pair of exclamation points to the U.S. Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education decision a decade earlier that had outlawed school segregation. But, as recent events and a selection of books both old and new reveal, Jim Crow is far from dead. He's alive and well and living in every corner of the USA. Jim Crow, it turns out, is many-hued, resilient, and quite possibly unkillable.\n\nWhite Jim Crow\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. called C. Vann Woodward's The Strange Career of Jim Crow \"the historical bible of the civil rights movement.\" Originally published in 1955-the year of the Montgomery bus boycott and Emmett Till's lynching-the book begins by disposing of the widely held misconception that Jim Crow was born in the ashes of Reconstruction, when federal troops withdrew from the South a dozen years after the end of the Civil War and, in effect, left the unanswered questions about race relations and reunion in the hands of white Southerners.\n\nThe rigid legal separation of the races across the South, Woodward points out, was not codified until the turn of the 20th century, a quarter-century after the collapse of Reconstruction . Jim Crow laws were built on white Southerners' iron conviction that the white race is superior to the black race, intellectually, morally, and physically. Therefore, the reasoning went, whites and blacks must be kept separate from cradle to grave-in hospitals, schools, public transit, parks, restaurants, theaters, hotels, churches, prisons, and graveyards. An Alabama law even made it illegal for whites and blacks to play checkers together. There was never any pretense, despite the wording of the Supreme Court's 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson ruling , that there would be anything equal about these separate worlds.\n\nThe key to Jim Crow's survival was disenfranchisement of the black voter, which was accomplished through literacy tests and poll taxes and, when they proved inadequate, intimidation and terror.\n\n\"In the early years of the 20th century,\" Woodward writes, \"it was becoming clear that the Negro would be effectively disenfranchised throughout the South, that he would be firmly relegated to the lower rungs of the economic ladder, and that neither equality nor aspirations for equality in any department of life were for him.\" Jim Crow laws, Woodward adds, \"constituted the most elaborate and formal expression of sovereign white opinion on the subject.\"\n\nBlack Jim Crow\n\nBut what about black opinion-and experience-of Jim Crow? Leon F. Litwack's Trouble in Mind: Black Southerners in the Age of Jim Crow , published in 1998, contains a blurb from C. Vann Woodward himself: \"This is the most complete and moving account we have had of what the victims of the Jim Crow South suffered and somehow endured.\"\n\nLitwack, who is white, manages to get inside the minds of the victims of Jim Crow, their terrors and aspirations, their coping mechanisms, their occasional but too-rare victories. He does this by telling the stories of the \"daily struggles\" of obscure, powerless, and usually poor blacks, dissecting their sense of helplessness in the face of the large and small indignities they suffered. It was a world in which a black man, or woman, could get mercilessly punished-or killed-for looking a white person in the eye, for becoming too educated or prosperous, for daring to own land or attempting to vote.\n\nIn Litwack's telling, Jim Crow was a response to the changes in black aspirations and behavior brought on by Reconstruction, when former slaves got their first brief taste of voting, holding political office, serving on juries, getting an education, working for themselves. Litwack quotes a black South Carolinian, Sam Gadsden, born in 1882: \"The white people began to begrudge these [n-words] their running around and doing just as they chose. That's all there is to segregation, that caused the whole thing. The white people couldn't master these [n-words] anymore so they took up the task of intimidating them.\" W.E.B. Du Bois put it a bit less earthily: \"The slave went free; stood a brief moment in the sun; then moved back again toward slavery.\"\n\nAs Litwack and historian David Oshinsky point out, life under Jim Crow was worse than slavery for many blacks. A fleeting taste of freedom only sharpened the bitter realities of sharecropping, convict leasing, the Ku Klux Klan, the lynching bee, and other staples of Jim Crow.\n\nMusic, as Litwack repeatedly demonstrates, had always been vital to survival for African slaves and their descendants. As W.C. Handy wrote in his autobiography, Father of the Blues , \"Southern Negroes sang about everything. Trains, steamboats, steam whistles, sledgehammers, fast women, mean bosses, stubborn mules-all become subjects for their songs. They accompany themselves on anything from which they can extract a musical sound or rhythmical effect, anything from a harmonica to a washboard.\" The blues was fed by these rich musical sources, as Litwack notes, including \"chants, work songs, field hollers, ring shouts, and country breakdowns.\"\n\nTyehimba Jess, this year's Pulitzer Prize winner for poetry, adds that when slavery and Jim Crow denied them conventional literacy, blacks had to adapt: \"They were forced to forge another kind of literacy through the music.\" But for many, the music could not provide sufficient balm or escape, and so they joined the millions who headed north and west in the last century's Great Migration. As the bluesman Cow Cow Davenport sang it:\n\nI'm tired of being Jim Crowed, gonna leave this Jim Crow town,\n\nDoggone my black soul, I'm sweet Chicago bound...\n\nAlbino Jim Crow\n\nJim Crow wasn't content with dominating the lives of black and white Southerners; he even found it necessary to dominate the lives of albinos. In her fascinating and heartbreaking new book, Truevine: Two Brothers, a Kidnapping, and a Mother's Quest: A True Story of the Jim Crow South , veteran reporter Beth Macy tells the story of the African-American albino brothers George and Willie Muse, who, sometime near the turn of the 20th century, were kidnapped under mysterious circumstances by a circus traveling through their hometown, a remote tobacco patch in southwest Virginia called Truevine. As the subtitle suggests, this is a book about a mother's quest to find and reclaim her sons. But as with so many stories spawned by Jim Crow, this one got complicated.\n\nMacy, a tireless reporter who worked this story for a quarter-century, concludes that George and Willie were definitely \"exploited, made to work without pay, then traded between various showmen like chattel.\" Their African features, nearly white skin, woolly white dreadlocks and jittery, light-sensitive eyes made them a popular sideshow attraction. They also became accomplished musicians, and were billed variously as \"The Ethiopian Monkey Men,\" \"Darwin's Missing Links,\" \"The Ambassadors from Mars,\" and \"Eko and Iko, the Ecuadorian Savages.\"\n\n\"As albinos,\" Macy writes, \"they were among the rarer finds, somewhere between a giant and a limbless man in the freak-show pecking order.\" But Macy digs up unsettling evidence that their mother, Harriet, may have contracted for them to join the circus and went looking for them only when payments for their services stopped making their way to her in Truevine. This was one of the unspoken horrors of Jim Crow: poor parents forced to turn their children into wage earners. For light-sensitive George and Willie Muse, it could be argued that working as sideshow freaks was preferable to pulling tobacco under a scalding Southern sun. Macy poses the essential question: \"Who is anyone to judge the pressures facing an illiterate washerwoman raising five children alone in rural Virginia during the harshest years of Jim Crow?\"\n\nWhatever the precise circumstances of George and Willie's departure from Truevine, Macy's book paints a vivid portrait of life under Jim Crow for small-town and rural blacks and their \"doubly different\" albino offspring. In nearby Roanoke, Virginia, blacks were denied factory jobs and forbidden from living on the same block with whites. The divide was so rigid that even the parrots were racists. Macy interviews an elderly black woman who recalls walking to her segregated school through a white neighborhood where a woman kept trained parrots on her screened-in porch. Whenever a group of black school kids approached, the parrots would squawk: \"See them little [n-words] coming.\"\n\nThe story of George and Willie Muse, remarkably, had an ending that was close to happy. They had long, successful careers with the circus, and after a protracted legal battle mounted by their mother, they got a portion of the money they had earned. They returned home to southwest Virginia and lived in comfort for many years amid loving family and friends. As one of their living descendants puts it, \"They came out on top.\" What were the odds of that?\n\nThe New Jim Crow\n\nAfter Barack Obama was elected president in 2008, the term \"post-racial\" entered the American lexicon. It has proven to be a fantasy conjured by overly optimistic pundits who believed that by electing their first black president, Americans had finally slipped the bonds of four centuries of racism.\n\nIn 2011, Michelle Alexander, an associate professor of law at Ohio State University and a former law clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun, published an important and necessary book called The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness , which demolished the comforting fantasy that Americans had bridged the racial divide. Alexander did this by focusing on the appalling facts that the United States has imprisoned some 7 million people, and a disproportionate number of prisoners (and probationers and parolees) have colored skin. Selective law enforcement, mandatory sentencing rules, and the resulting mass incarceration have created what Alexander calls \"a racial caste system.\"\n\nThe point is valid and valuable, but unfortunately Alexander's explanation of its causes is too narrow. She blames the New Jim Crow entirely on President Ronald Reagan's unleashing of a War on Drugs in 1982-three years before crack cocaine began ravaging the nation's inner cities-a war waged vigorously by Reagan's successors (most notably Bill Clinton), with the result that the prison population has soared even as the crime rate has declined to historic lows.\n\nAlexander's focus on the War on Drugs, while valid, ignores the more nuanced forces that helped birth the New Jim Crow. In his new book Locked In , John F. Pfaff, a law professor at Fordham University, acknowledges that mass incarceration is \"one of the biggest social problems the United States faces today,\" but he then proceeds to debunk the \"standard story\" put forth my Alexander and others-that today's appalling rates of incarceration are driven exclusively by the racist persecution of minorities for nonviolent drug crimes. In fact, Pfaff points out, since the rising wave of incarcerations peaked around 2010, nonviolent drug offenders have accounted for only about one-fifth of new prisoners. The War on Drugs, he concludes, \"simply hasn't sent enough people to state prisons for it to be a major engine of state prison growth.\"\n\nSo what is the engine? Pfaff posits that it's a pair of linked inequities: woefully overworked public defenders going up against elected prosecutors who wield virtually unfettered power to threaten arrestees with stiff sentences-and lots of them-a ploy that results in plea bargains in 95 percent of all convictions. Only a small fraction of the people in prison today were sent there by a jury of their peers, a circumvention of one of the pillars of American democracy. Regardless of the actual crime rate, no district attorney facing re-election can afford to be labeled \"soft on crime.\" The tools are there for prosecutors to send legions to prison, and most prosecutors are happy to use them.\n\nEvents since the publication of The New Jim Crow have further eroded Alexander's one-note argument. In her epilogue to Truevine , written in 2015, Beth Macy states, \"In the past year, 32 states have enforced new voter identification requirements that disproportionately disenfranchise poor and minority voters, and 26 unarmed black men have been fatally shot by police across the United States of America.\"\n\nThis political chicanery and physical violence are surely facets of the New Jim Crow, and they've spawned an admirable wave of activism that points out, inadvertently but invaluably, that any nation that needs to be reminded that Black Lives Matter is not a nation that has progressed very far.\n\nMeanwhile, the Republican-dominated North Carolina legislature redrew the state's General Assembly districts in a fashion so redolent of Jim Crow that federal judges struck 28 of them down, saying they were \"racially gerrymandered in violation of the equal protection clause.\"\n\nA May 14 front-page story in The New York Times reported that, even as numerous state legislatures are shrinking their prison populations and downgrading nonviolent drug crimes from felonies to misdemeanors, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has announced that federal prosecutors should put more people in prison for longer periods, raising fears among reformers, including many conservatives, \"that the Trump administration was embracing failed, even racist, policies.\"\n\nNo surprise there. Sessions, after all, serves a president who borrowed a page from Richard Nixon's 1968 campaign and promised to get tough on crime and, for good measure, erect a wall along one of our two international borders and bar citizens from countries dominated by a particular religion. All of these familiar tactics-disenfranchisement, police brutality, xenophobia, along with the twinned national disgraces of racially tainted law enforcement and mass incarceration-make up the New Jim Crow. Who, it turns out, bears more than a passing resemblance to the Old Jim Crow.\n\nYes, Jim Crow is alive and well and living in every corner of the USA. He's still many-hued and resilient. And he's as unkillable as ever.\n\nbillmorris52@gmail.com\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "The Ugly Nationalist Politics of Human Origins\n\nOn Thursday morning The New York Times ran a high profile story about the discovery of a new human ancestor species- Homo naledi -in the Rising Star cave in South Africa. The discovery, announced by professor Lee Berger, was monumental because the evidence for Homo naledi were discovered in a burial chamber. Concern for burial is usually seen as distinctive characteristic of humankind, so the possibility that this new non-human hominid species was \"deliberately disposing of its dead\" was especially exciting.\n\nTo anthropologists the article was not only newsworthy it was also humorous, for the Times illustrated the piece with a photograph of Australopithecus africanus , a species already well-known. This howler of a mistake (at least to self-identified science nerds)  was also somewhat understandable because the differences between the two skulls are sufficiently subtle that a lay viewer can indeed easily mistake them for one another.  In fact, some have pointed to that similarity and wondered (while acknowledging the importance of the discovery) if it is indeed a \"new species.\"And that gets to the deeper issue: What and who were our ancestors?\n\nIt might seem as if the answer to this question is simply a question of biology, but in his new book Tales of the Ex-Apes : How we think about human Evolution anthropologist Jonathan Marks argues that the story we tell about our origins, the study of our evolutionary tree, has cultural roots. Evolution isn't just a question of biology, he argues, it's also a question of mythology. Our scientific facts, he says, are the product of bioculture and biopolitics.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe study of who we are and where we came from is inherently political, even as science. Understanding what he means by this is best explained by way of example. Take, say, race. In the U.S. the 19 th -century \"American school\" of physical anthropologists used racial features to hypothesize that there were separate origins for the races. As late as 1962, the evolutionary \"fact\" that the black race was 200,000 years less evolved than the white race was used to argue in favor of segregation.\n\nA similar thing happened during the Franco-Prussian War: The French anthropologist Armand de Quatrefages used cranial examination to claim that the Prussians weren't real Europeans at all. Instead they were foreigners who were related to the Finns. Both de Quatrefages and the American school were using science to describe the social difference that surrounded them.\n\nCultural influence on science extends even to the reaches of outer space. When NASA sent the Pioneer plaque out to greet the aliens in 1972 they included a picture of a man and a woman standing alongside one another, naked. The people are naked because NASA wanted to depict humanity in its \"natural\" state. Clothing would suggest a particular nationality, culture, and social status. It was a sweet thought but there's no \"natural state\" for the human body. The woman is posed looking demurely downwards while the man courageously waves hello (or, as Marks humorously observes, signals \"halt\") and makes eye contact with the viewer. (If the alien viewer happens to respond to eye contact the way baboons do, it could well spell trouble for our planet.) But so much for mere biology, the Pioneer plaque parades our own gender norms across the universe.\n\nIt may not come as a newsflash to anyone that 19 th and 20 th century scientists can be racist and sexist, respectively. But Marks's point isn't that scientists are jerks but rather, that our biological and zoological knowledge is shaped by history and culture.\n\nThe same phenomenon emerges in scientific efforts to explain the origin of morality. Evolutionary biologists often explain the emergence of morality in terms of Darwinian imperatives about survival and breeding. The taboo against incest, for example, is often explained as just a natural imperative to prevent inbreeding. Marks reviews anthropology and primatology to show how the rules forbidding incest emerged. Because human offspring (unlike that of other primates) remain in a the same social group throughout puberty, the sexual conduct of opposite-sex siblings had to be managed. Such management constitutes the invention of rules, and making, following, and breaking those rules is in large measure what makes us human.\n\nAs Marks told me, \"the study of who we are and where we came from is not like the study of what salamanders are and where they came from; the facts of our identity and ancestry are biopolitical facts, not zoological facts. Our ancestry is invested with meaning... and consequently, if you limit yourself to zoological knowledge, you cannot fully understand human diversity or origins.\"\n\nThese biocultural issues are at play in this week's discovery of Homo naledi. Many observers are asking is this a \"real\" species, but perhaps we should also ask \"what's at stake in identifying a new species?\" What reporting on this new discovery didn't mention is how evolutionary theories about the geographical origins of the human race are connected, for example, to nationalism. Lee Berger is already a hero in South Africa for discovering pre-human species. His latest discovery of a potential burial site has some claiming that they had religious beliefs, which is a weighty claim indeed.\n\nThere's a lot more at stake in identifying the earliest \"first\" example of our ancestors, than in identifying the second or third. The identification of a new species gives the geographical location of that species a privileged position when it comes to telling the story of evolution. As Marks puts it, \"South Africa has their species; Spain has their species, Indonesia has their species... This is about who gets to partake in, and to tell, the authoritative scientific story of our origins. It's a lot more than biology.\" Marks's book is a wise and witty analysis of how science and culture are inextricably intertwined as we compose and narrate the science of who we are and where we came from, and it permits us to make just a bit more sense of the science.\n\nSo is Homo naledi a \"real\" species? If you are thinking about a species as a zoological entity, you'll simply bang your head against the wall trying to decide. But our ancestors, says Marks, are not accessible to science as zoological entities; they are more complex biocultural entities. They aren't like salamander species, because you can't have the same relationship to your immediate ancestors that you have to amphibians. It's just part of being human.\n\ncandidarmoss@gmail.com\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "The Right's Absurd Herman Cain Race Card\n\nIs racism to blame for the sexual harassment claims against Herman Cain? Michelle Goldberg on the roots of leading conservatives' cynical strategy. Plus, Patricia Murphy on Gloria Cain's public debut .\n\nIt has been interesting, if also predictable, to watch conservatives reacting to the Herman Cain sexual harassment allegations discover the horrors of anti-black racism. After all, they've spent the past three years claiming that the real victims of racism in the United States are white.\n\n\"Have we ever had a president who was such a partisan hack, such a race-baiter?\" Rush Limbaugh asked last year. Meanwhile, he's been utterly dismissive of the notion that the Tea Party has shown racism against African-Americans, saying, \"[T]he charge of racism is losing its heft...it's been overdone and overblown.\" Writing of allegations of racism on college campuses in her 2009 book Guilty: Liberal 'Victims' and Their Assault on America , Ann Coulter charged, \"Rather than 'institutional racism,' what we're witnessing is 'institutional racial hoaxism' committed by liberals.\" Calling the GOP's infamous Willie Horton ads \"powerful,\" Erick Erickson has urged Republican strategists to create a new generation of similar spots about the farcical New Black Panther party, writing, \"The Democrats are giving a pass to radicals who advocate killing white kids in the name of racial justice and who try to block voters from the polls.\"\n\nThen, this week, everything changed. Suddenly, the right sees the \"institutional racism\" that Coulter disparaged everywhere. \"Look at how quickly what is known as the mainstream media goes for the ugliest racial stereotypes they can to attack a black conservative,\" Limbaugh said on Monday. \"I Declare Politico's Attack On Herman Cain Racist,\" blared a headline on RightWingNews.com. On Fox and Friends Tuesday morning, guest host Peter Johnson Jr. alluded to Clarence Thomas, saying, \"[M]aybe this is a high-tech lynching that Politico engaged in.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis is an absurd charge. Herman Cain is currently leading the Republican polls. If he wants to be treated as a serious candidate-something that's not entirely clear, given his lack of a campaign staff in Iowa and New Hampshire-he's going to be subjected to serious scrutiny. When a major presidential candidate has been accused of sexual harassment , and when his accusers have received financial settlements as a result of their complaints, that's news. Indeed, that's so obvious it seems absurd to have to write it. Just imagine, after all, how much decorousness we could expect from Fox if such a scandal were discovered in Obama's past.\n\nBut it's not really surprising that the right, usually so dismissive of prejudice against African-Americans, has been so quick to cry racism. The modern conservative movement emerged in large part in opposition to the civil rights revolution, which caused Dixiecrats to flee to the GOP en masse. Even the Christian right began with racial grievance; as the evangelical Columbia professor Randall Balmer showed in his 2006 book, Thy Kingdom Come , the religious right was born out of the backlash against the IRS's 1975 decision to revoke Bob Jones University's tax-exempt status because of its prohibition on interracial dating. In his 1996 book Active Faith, Ralph Reed acknowledged that his movement was on the wrong side of the fight for civil rights, writing, \"The white evangelical church carries a shameful legacy of racism and the historical baggage of indifference to the most central struggle for social justice in this century, a legacy that is only now being wiped clean by the sanctifying work of repentance and racial reconciliation.\"\n\nAs Reed's word suggest, many on the right badly wants to be rid of this stain on their history. It's a sign of progress that almost everyone in American public life considers racism to be shameful. At the same time, most conservatives remain opposed to policies designed to remedy the effects of past discrimination, and the movement is largely uncomfortable with the multicultural transformation of the United States. They want to wrap themselves in the now-unquestioned moral legitimacy of the civil rights movement without actually backing the movement's goals. Hence Glenn Beck's rally at the Washington Mall on the anniversary of Martin Luther King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech, or the parade of white congressmen who lined up to proclaim that they were saving black babies by trying to defund Planned Parenthood earlier this year.\n\nPart of Herman Cain's appeal is that he absolves the right of racism without asking them to change. It's worth remembering that some conservatives briefly turned on him when he suggested that Rick Perry showed a \"lack of sensitivity\" by leaving the name \"Niggerhead\" on a rock outside his ranch. In the Daily Caller, Matt Lewis called Cain's words \"a cheap shot, and, perhaps a signal that Cain is willing to play the race card against a fellow Republican when it benefits him.\" The influential right-wing blogger Glenn Reynolds was similarly disapproving, writing that Cain's \"big appeal is that he's not just another black race-card-playing politician.\"\n\nSince then, Cain has made sure not to say anything that would impute racism to conservatives, and he's been forgiven. Now, with Cain in the lead, the right is reveling in racial self-congratulation. Ann Coulter put it most crudely on Tuesday, telling Sean Hannity, \"Our blacks are so much better than their blacks.\" Lots of conservatives believe that liberals have been unfairly shutting down the conversation about our socialist Kenyan president's anti-American policies by crying \"racism.\" Cain gives them a chance to try and do the same thing, without changing anything else about their modus operandi. If he sticks around, this won't be the last time they take advantage of it.\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "Charleston's Finally Ready to Tear Down Its Jim Crow Era Slavery Shrine. Will South Carolina's GOP Let It?\n\nFive years ago today, a white neo-Confederate shot dead nine black parishioners at Mother Emanuel Baptist Church, located just up the street from where a statue honoring John C. Calhoun-who in an 1837 speech famously deemed the enslavement of black human beings \" instead of an evil, a good - a positive good \"-has stood for more than 130 years in the heart of Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Charleston Mayor John Tecklenburg announced his plan to send a resolution to the City Council to remove the monument -a move long overdue. In the same speech cited above, Calhoun stated , \"never before has the black race of Central Africa, from the dawn of history to the present day, attained a condition so civilized and so improved, not only physically, but morally and intellectually.\" In other words, Calhoun believed the brutality and horror of slavery was the best thing that ever happened to black folks in this country.\n\nAnd in 1887, white Charlestonians let black folks know how much they agreed with Calhoun by putting up a statue in his image. Even the statue's location at the Old Citadel, once an arsenal and a guardhouse to literally shoot down any uprising of enslaved black folks, is imbued with white supremacist terror and violence.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBlack Charlestonians have been trying to knock Calhoun off his pedestal ever since. When the original Calhoun statue went up, it stood about 45 feet off the ground . There at Calhoun's feet was another statue-the figure of a woman who was supposed to represent Justice . One year after the monument's dedication, the Justice figure was found with a tin kettle in her hand and a cigar in her mouth.\n\nIn 1892, someone painted the face of the Justice statue white. A young black boy named Andrew Haig was arrested for shooting at the Justice statue with a pistol in 1894. And in early 1895, there was so much activity around the Calhoun monument that a park keeper was hired to stop \" the nuisances and depredations now committed by goats, boys, and night prowlers.\"\n\nCharleston civil rights worker and educator Mamie Garvin Fields was born one year after the Calhoun statue was erected. In her memoirs , she wrote, \"We used to carry something with us, if we knew we would be passing that way, in order to deface that statue-scratch up the coat, break the watch chain, try to knock off the nose-because he looked like he was telling you there was a place for 'niggers' and 'niggers' must stay there. I believe white people were talking to us about Jim Crow through that statue.\"\n\nThe original Calhoun statue was finally removed on Thanksgiving day in 1895. A local newspaper reported that, as the statue was being taken down off its plinth, a group of young black boys standing nearby \" skillfully pasted Mr. Calhoun in the eye with a lump of mud.\" The new statue of Calhoun that went up in 1896-the figure that still stands there today-was put atop a pedestal 115 feet off the ground, far out of the reach of would-be protesters.\n\nAs Fields wrote in her memoir, \"Children and adults beat up John C. Calhoun so badly that the whites had to come back and put him way up high, so we couldn't get to him.\"\n\nSouth Carolina's Republican lawmakers have done the dirty work of making sure that the Calhoun marker, as well as 175 monuments to Confederate traitors, remain standing. (Calhoun died in 1850, before the Civil War, but his ideas formed the core of Confederate secessionist ideology.) In 2000, GOP legislators passed the state's Heritage Act, legislation that-like the Calhoun monument itself-served as a retaliatory action against the most minor of civil rights gains and challenges to white supremacy: the removal of the Confederate flag from the South Carolina statehouse dome to another flagpole on the statehouse lawn .\n\nMembers of the Charleston City council have already publicly stated they have the votes to take the statue down , but they may have to contend with those lawmakers and that law.\n\nHere's hoping defenders of the Confederacy and all those associated lose the fight.

      "text": "Meet the Black Blues Musician Who Befriended the KKK\n\nFor decades, blues musician Daryl Davis has been raising eyebrows with his unconventional hobby: befriending and converting bigoted members of the Ku Klux Klan, whose white hoods he symbolically collects along the way.\n\n\"I try to bring out the humanity in people,\" he told The Daily Beast following the SXSW premiere of Accidental Courtesy , a documentary about Davis and his unorthodox methods that sparked provocative Q&As at the festival. Sitting down to chat in Austin, Texas, flanked by director Matthew Ornstein and ex-KKK member Scott Shepherd, Davis smiled warmly. \"We all are human beings at the end of the day.\"\n\nThe film chronicles D.C. fixture Davis's remarkable knack for winning over racists with friendship, and includes several scenes in which the Chicago-born bluesman boldly initiates sit-down conversations about race with some of America's preeminent racists.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe even manages to find common ground with notorious racists like National Socialist Movement chairman Jeff Schoep, who appears in Accidental Courtesy advocating for white separatism before sharing a laugh and a handshake with the affable Davis over the origins of rock 'n' roll and peanut butter, of all things.\n\nBut Davis's encounters with his fellow African-American activists in the film are far from harmonious. Accidental Courtesy briefly depicts Davis meeting with young Baltimore activists Kwame Rose and Tariq Touré, who abruptly walk off camera after a heated exchange with Davis , and veteran community organizer JC Faulk, who then admonishes Davis for his treatment of the two men.\n\nIn the snatches of conversation seen in the film, insults are lobbed. Tensions rise. Neither party cedes ground to the other side, despite the spirit of mutual understanding and discourse that marks these tentative summits Davis has been initiating for decades with active KKK leaders, white supremacists, and neo-Nazis.\n\nDavis took the film's premiere as an opportunity to launch further insults at activist and artist Rose, who was not present. \"As the man said, he's a 21-year-old dropout,\" Davis told the audience, adding that the film did not include footage from the two-hour session in which he claims the Black Lives Matter activists came back after storming off during their interview, intent on fighting him.\n\nWhen I spoke with him a few days later, Davis said he had no regrets over how his exchange with the BLM activists went down. He stood by public comments he made in which he called Rose \"stupid\"-as opposed to some white supremacists, who he described as merely \"ignorant\"-and went one step further in his assessment of Rose: \"I consider him to be a racist.\"\n\n\"I don't consider myself to be a racist, but to me there's not much difference between a black racist or a white racist,\" he explained. \"The bottom line is, this country's getting smaller and smaller. We have to learn to get along. We don't have to agree with everything, but we have to learn how to respect one another and work for the same common goal. Because the best way for us to be defeated is by dividing and conquering, and we are a very divided nation right now.\"\n\nDavis is no stranger to criticism from within the African-American community. He's been getting it for years from folks on all sides put off by his unconventional work with the KKK. \"When you join the Mafia you do not snitch, you do not sell out your own. You will be killed. That's their code. The police have their own-it's called the blue wall of silence,\" Davis began. The Klan similarly turns on those who betray the group, and the black community is no different, he said.\n\n\"Kwame Rose feels that I sold out my own race. Not that he would kill me. He's not the Mafia! But he feels that I'm a race traitor,\" Davis said, recalling the full exchange they had that day. \"I was called Uncle Tom by him. I was called Uncle Ruckus. I was called all kinds of names, and it kept escalating and got contentious on both sides.\"\n\n\"They could not see any value to what I was doing, which is fine,\" he added. \"We all want the same thing, ultimately. But the only use for white people that he has is for those white people that would help him further his cause, or the black cause. I have use for everybody .\"\n\n\"I've done all this research,\" he continued with a smile. \"I've been doing this since he was still in Baghdad-and by Baghdad, I mean in his father's sperm sack.\"\n\nIt's easy to see the clash as a generational divide between the younger generation and Davis, 58, who spent part of his childhood abroad attending international schools as the son of a Foreign Service officer before graduating from Howard University.\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr.'s work and assassination made a particularly indelible impression on his life. He had his first personal encounter with a white supremacist years later as a touring musician, when a Klan member at a gig struck up a conversation, impressed that Davis could play piano like Jerry Lee Lewis.\n\nMillennial activists like Rose and Toure, on the other hand, were born into a different world. They and their peers were galvanized by the immediacy of violent deaths like that of Freddie Gray in their own city. Where Davis seeks to change one racist mind at a time, the young activists of Black Lives Matter utilize social media to connect and amplify their message to millions. Rose in particular made his name in the Black Lives Matter movement when footage of him challenging Geraldo Rivera's Baltimore coverage on national television went viral.\n\nUntil that encounter Rose had never heard of Geraldo, he admitted to me the day after I met with Davis. Rose had heard reactions to the film's premiere on Twitter and arrived in Austin during SXSW that week, hoping to participate in subsequent Q&As. I caught up with him a few hours after he finally saw the film for the first time.\n\n\"Overall, the conversation was portrayed accurately, and in a good light,\" said Rose. He remembered things escalating quickly, \"but I didn't want to leave the conversation like that. I wanted to invoke and challenge his thought process about actually inspiring young people to create change, instead of re-invoking trauma and fear of white-hooded men.\"\n\n\"I have cousins that were raised in the military, and even my parents aren't as 'woke' as myself or my peers,\" Rose offered. \"I don't think Daryl has internalized his blackness, how he fits into society as a black man fully, or what that means. I think how he tries to mask his blackness is by befriending white supremacists and getting them to adapt to this idea that we're one human race.\"\n\nBut turning dozens of Klansmen away from their hatemongering lifestyles isn't enough, he said. \"For me, a completely reformed former KKK member or white supremacist would be someone who not only apologizes for what they've done, but actively works toward repairing or providing reparations for the lives in the communities which they've affected-or for the thousands of people who have seen images of them in that white hood and the trauma that it's invoked in so many young people.\"\n\nHe calmly considered the ways in which Davis has described everything from his racial politics to his rejection of institutional education. \"I'm not a black supremacist,\" he said. \"I don't believe that the black race is better than any race. I don't think we'll ever have an independent black nation in this world. But there is nothing wrong with building independent black institutions that operate outside of the confines of white supremacy, that address the needs of black people in this country.\"\n\nAfter that Geraldo video blew up online, Rose lost his job. He took to public speaking and advocacy work, traveling the country to encourage young people into social activism.\n\n\"We look at people like Kanye West , who is one of the most brilliant artistic masterminds of our time, and we challenge his craziness because he steps outside of the box,\" said Rose. \"Everything that I do, my advocacy, my activism, is to get people to think outside this box of thinking there is one clear path to success, to achieving the American dream. It's all about individualism and being the best person that you are when you look in the mirror.\"\n\nLast week, a Baltimore court found Rose guilty of failing to obey an order from law enforcement for using a bullhorn while protesting the mistrial that failed to find Baltimore cop William Porter responsible for Freddie Gray's death. The ACLU is helping him appeal that verdict.\n\nLike Davis, Rose is quickly learning what it means to attract both positive and negative attention to his activist work. \"The police have also taken my car, they've shown up to my house off-duty to threaten me,\" said Rose. \"But I don't let that deter me. I'm more determined than ever. I hope to be the light. I hope to be the spark in people's brains. I'm stepping into adulthood and realizing it's not a utopia.\"\n\nDavis, meanwhile, says he can see where the Black Lives Matter movement's sights are set as November's presidential election quickly approaches, \"but there are certain things you've got to do to get there. Being aggressive and running into political rallies like Hillary Clinton's or even Trump's... and trying to shut it down, is not the right way. You're simply fueling their rage and enraging them rather than trying to bring them around to your side of the table.\"\n\nDavis has known a few racists in his day. Ask him about the 2016 election and he gives GOP frontrunner Donald Trump a pass, but fears that the Donald's tack of playing to racists may become a strategy others replicate in future elections.\n\n\"I don't believe that Donald Trump is a racist, per se,\" said Davis. \"But some of the things that he does, some of the rhetoric that he uses, attracts racists and that sets the tone. And of course, you are judged by the company you keep,\" he said. \"So while you may not be a racist, when you've got a bunch of racists out there in your audience... then it reflects upon you.\"\n\n\"Am I going to vote for Trump? Absolutely not. I do not believe in his platform,\" he chuckled. Neither does Dr. Ben Carson, whom he met years ago, impress him now that Carson's set his eyes on political office.\n\n\"When I first met him I liked him a lot. He's a brilliant man. A very impressive man,\" said Davis. \"But I met him again years later, a few months back. I was not impressed at all. He has no business in politics whatsoever. [It was his] arrogance. A lack of knowledge of what he's talking about. He needs to stick to his medical practice. I thought he was very biased towards homosexuals and towards other people, and I just lost respect for his knowledge in those areas.\"\n\nNow that Accidental Courtesy has premiered at SXSW, the filmmakers are hoping a copy makes its way into the Oval Office, where President Obama might watch it.\n\nAnd while they haven't quite become friends-despite both appearing in person at SXSW to discuss the film-Davis and Rose may yet find their common ground.\n\n\"He accused me of not working to change the system, the system of white supremacy, the system that oppresses black people,\" Davis said of Rose. \"So my comeback to that is, look: The system didn't disappear. It was created by white supremacists. It was created by men. So you have to change the minds of men . They're the ones who have to change the system. You change those minds. That's what I'm working on.\"\n\nDavis says he'd welcome Rose to sit down with him again to continue the discussion they began in Accidental Courtesy \"so we each can learn from one another and figure out, okay, I may not be able to do everything you want me to do, but what can I do that I feel comfortable with to help you?\"\n\nBoth men say that continued conversations in their own respective communities is key to lasting, meaningful change. Maybe greater understanding can yet be found the second time around. \"It's hard to come together [with other races],\" Davis admitted, \"when I can't come together with my own.\"\n\njen.yamato@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "You turn to us for voices you won't hear anywhere else.\n\nSign up for Democracy Now!'s Daily Digest to get our latest headlines and stories delivered to your inbox every day.\n\nby Amy Goodman and Denis Moynihan\n\nThe haunting gaze of Papa Renty peers from the 1850 daguerreotype. The enslaved man was forced to pose, naked, for a study being conducted by a racist Harvard anthropologist named Louis Agassiz. The Swiss-born scientist promoted \"polygenism,\" a theory that held that different races were separate species, and that the white race was far superior to the black race. To validate this, Agassiz traveled from Harvard to South Carolina seeking authentic, \"pure\" black slaves, those whose original, African racial makeup hadn't been diluted, as all too often occurred, by the rape of slave women by their white masters. Agassiz commissioned these images of Renty, his daughter Delia and other slaves, and returned to Harvard. The images eventually ended up in a storage cabinet, forgotten, until they were discovered in 1976. Since then, Harvard has kept tight control over access to the collection, charging licensing fees to any seeking to use them. Now, Tamara Lanier, one of Renty's direct descendants, is suing Harvard, demanding that the daguerreotypes of Renty and Delia be returned to the family.\n\n\"When will Harvard University finally free Renty?\" Lanier's lawyer, civil-rights attorney Benjamin Crump, asked on the \"Democracy Now!\" news hour. \"These daguerreotypes are very, very valuable. They are the earliest known photographs of American slaves and some of the earliest known photographs in America,\" adding that they are \"priceless to Tamara Lanier and her family, because they're the linear descendants. ... But Harvard is telling Ms. Lanier and her family: 'No, no, Renty still belongs to us. He's still our property.'\"\n\nOwnership of the daguerreotypes is a legal question that strikes at the heart of slavery, its history in building not only the United States but also institutions like Harvard, and what our society owes to descendants of slaves. \"Make no mistake about it,\" Crump said. The lawsuit \"is landmark in its scope, because it will be the first time that descendants of African slaves in America have been compensated in any way, fashion or form from an American institution.\" He says it could be as important as Brown v. Board of Education, the 1954 Supreme Court case that desegregated schools nationally.\n\nThe riveting, 24-page complaint opens with a quote from Maya Angelou, also a descendant of slaves: \"History, despite its wrenching pain, cannot be unlived, but if faced with courage need not be lived again.\" The lawsuit details Louis Agassiz's racist theories and his meteoric rise in U.S. academic and elite circles. It recounts how his research describing the inferiority of blacks was funded by a Boston textile magnate whose business depended on a steady supply of cheap cotton from Southern slave plantations.\n\nIt also describes what is known of Papa Renty. A native of Congo, Renty somehow obtained a copy of Noah Webster's \"Blue Back Speller,\" and managed to teach himself, and others, to read - a crime for slaves. It's the same book legendary abolitionist Frederick Douglass used when learning to read and write while still enslaved, working in Baltimore's shipyards. Papa Renty's son and grandson were also named Renty. They were forced to use the surname of their owner, Taylor. Renty Taylor III was sold to a slave owner named Thompson. Among his children was Frederick Douglass Thompson, Tamara Lanier's grandfather.\n\n\"As a child, my mom often talked about her enslaved ancestors, particularly the man in the image, who she fondly referred to as Papa Renty,\" Lanier said on \"Democracy Now!\" \"She also talked about our lineage, how our family was broken apart by slavery.\"\n\nAlong with Renty, and Delia, Harvard's collection has images of other slaves, taken in the same Columbia, South Carolina, portrait studio. They are mugshot style, one image head-on, another from the side. Also from Taylor's plantation is Jack, a native of Guinea, and his daughter, Drana. Drana, like Delia, is stripped to the waist, like the men. From the plantation of a Col. Wade Hamilton, also near Columbia, is a male named Fassena, a carpenter and slave.\n\nTamara Lanier hopes the images will expand the national dialogue on slavery. \"It's important for me that people know who Renty was and who Agassiz was,\" she said. \"I hope that there is a greater education or a reteaching of history, so that we can dispute the legacy that Agassiz has stained my family with.\"\n\nWhile her lawsuit proceeds, the images of Renty and the others remain at the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University, bearing the copyright, \"President and Fellows of Harvard College.\" On this, the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first slave ship to the shores of North America, it is high time for Harvard to give up its claimed copyright and just do what's right, reuniting Renty and Delia with their descendants.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

On Thursday, mourners gathered for the first two funerals in a series of services that will continue today and over the weekend. Loved ones remembered Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, a 45-year-old mother of three, reverend and high school track coach; and Ethel Lance, a 70-year-old grandmother who had worked at Emanuel AME for more than three decades. The funeral for Emanuel AME's pastor, Rev. Clementa Pinckney, also a state senator, will be held today. President Obama will deliver the eulogy. Outside Rev. Pinckney's wake on Thursday, the line wrapped around the block. We hear from some of those who came to pay their respects. \"To me, it's the 9/11 of the black church,\" says Rev. J. Michael Little. \"We snatched victory out of this. [Dylann Roof] wanted civil war, but instead it's a rally for unity.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're on the road in Charleston, South Carolina, right in front of Emanuel AME Church-that's Mother Emanuel-where on June 17 nine people were gunned down in the basement as they attended Bible study. We're on Calhoun Street, named for one of the most prominent pro-slavery figures in history-yes, John C. Calhoun, the late senator and vice president, who argued slavery was a \"positive good\" rather than a \"necessary evil.\"\n\nWell, on Thursday, people gathered to attend the first two funerals in a series of services that will continue today and over the weekend. Loved ones remembered Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, a 45-year-old mother of three, reverend and high school track coach; and Ethel Lance, a 70-year-old grandmother who had worked at Emanuel AME for more than three decades. South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley attended the services, along with Reverend Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton. This is Ethel Lance's granddaughter and grandson.\n\nAURELIA WASHINGTON : I want everybody to know that my grandmother is a wonderful, wonderful, precious woman. And we don't have no hate for nobody, because our power of love is stronger than ever.\n\nBRANDON RISHER : Ethel, E-T-H-E-L. E, everybody in this room. T, tough, tough love, tough love. She will show you tough love. That's just because she wants you to strive and do better. H, her. Again, that's everybody in this room. E, equality. She believed in that. And L, love. That's Ethel. That's everybody in this room.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : On Wednesday, thousands filed past the body of the Emanuel AME Church's pastor, 41-year-old Reverend Clementa Pinckney, also a South Carolina state senator, as he lay in state at the Capitol, one of the few African Americans to do so. His body had to be brought past the Confederate flag at the state Capitol, the symbol embraced by the alleged shooter, Dylann Roof. On Thursday, Reverend Pinckney's body was taken to Ridgeland here in South Carolina, his hometown church, and then to Mother Emanuel right here in Charleston, where again thousands lined up around the blocks to see him, among them activist Austin McCoy, who drove to Charleston from Ann Arbor, Michigan, and described what it was like inside the church.\n\nAUSTIN McCOY: I walked through and saw his body. And yeah, it was just striking how they put a microphone in one hand, or his microphone, and a pair of his glasses, and had him dressed in his religious garb. It was, yeah, really quiet, heavy, you know, obviously very emotional. I mean, I'm still trying to process what I just saw.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Reverend Pinckney's funeral will be held today at the College of Charleston, not far from where we are now, with President Obama offering the eulogy and first lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Biden, members of Congress, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton all in attendance. This is Reverend McKinley Washington Jr. speaking at Reverend Pinckney's wake on Thursday.\n\nREV . McKINLEY WASHINGTON JR.: Whoever thought that a little black boy from Jasper County would bring the president of the United States of America and the vice president of the United States of America to Charleston County? And he paid the price for you and for me. And because of that price, things positive would happen in South Carolina, changed folks' hearts, changed South Carolina. So long, Brother Pinckney. We love you, brother. [inaudible]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Outside Reverend Pinckney's wake, the line wrapped around the block. The wake was scheduled to end at 8:00 p.m., but it was after 9:00 when police finally closed off the line, moving in the barricades. Outside the church, we spoke to some of the people who came to Mother Emanuel to pay their last respects.\n\nREBECCA DANIEL DUGGER : Rebecca Daniel Dugger. I'm from Atlanta, Georgia. And, actually, Sharonda Coleman-Singleton was our sorority sister. And so we're here to honor her. We were here for her funeral services today and to just show support to the people of Charleston. She was a mother. She was a coach. She was a minister. She was a woman of God, and she was a woman of service. And she took in all people, all kinds of folks. And she just would minister to them, not only about the gospel, just about life. And so, she was just a beautiful, beautiful person. And she instilled that also in her children. And so, we are just here really to uplift her and support her.\n\nREV . J. MICHAEL LITTLE : I'm Reverend J. Michael Little. I'm a pastor in D.C. at the Friendship Baptist Church in D.C. This is my wife Marie.\n\nMARIE LITTLE : Hi.\n\nREV . J. MICHAEL LITTLE : And I'm basically just traumatized by-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You flew down?\n\nREV . J. MICHAEL LITTLE : We drove down. We drove down. We actually just got off the road from D.C. You know, we feel like this is a terrible moment in history. We just want to be a part of it. We want to pay our respects, be in prayer and be in solidarity with all the folk down here. It's-to me, it's the 911 or the 9/11 of the black church. It's just-it impacts all of us. And we pastors are profoundly affected, so we couldn't not come.\n\nMARIE LITTLE : Exactly, exactly.\n\nREV . J. MICHAEL LITTLE : Yeah, we just absolutely had to be here.\n\nMARIE LITTLE : And we're just shaken and trying to come to grips with it and-but trying to be just like the parishioners here and saying, \"You know what? Love trumps all.\"\n\nREV . J. MICHAEL LITTLE : We're actually snatching victory out of this. I mean, think about it. He wanted a civil war. He wanted social conflagration. Instead, it's a rallying point for unity.\n\nMARIE LITTLE : Exactly.\n\nREV . J. MICHAEL LITTLE : I mean, hopefully he can see the news and catch glimpses of what's going on because of his actions. It's the-\n\nMARIE LITTLE : Total opposite.\n\nREV . J. MICHAEL LITTLE : It's evil inverted. It's just, you know, the way this has turned out.\n\nMOURNERS : [singing] Praise the Lord, Hallelujah, I'm free.\n\nERIC SNYDER : My name is Eric Snyder. I've lived here five years, from New York City.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You're starting a petition?\n\nERIC SNYDER : I am. I'm starting a petition, and I put it on MoveOn.org yesterday. And it's to rename Calhoun Street to Reverend Clementa Pinckney Street. The indignity that a church that has suffered so much as this one in the history of Charleston has to have as its address John C. Calhoun.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Explain his significance.\n\nERIC SNYDER : He's one of the most important American figures in support of white supremacy. The quotes that he has are just beyond understanding in America 2015 why anyone would honor a man like that. And I do know today, I read online, that some congressmen are starting to look at the John C. Calhoun Memorial in the Capitol rotunda as something that needs to be discussed.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : John C. Calhoun, the former U.S. vice president and U.S. senator-\n\nERIC SNYDER : Senator, yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : -who said slavery is good.\n\nERIC SNYDER : Yes. He has a lot of quotes defending slavery, and also he has quotes that basically say that this is a battle between the white race and the black race. 2015, that's not a man to honor.\n\nMOURNERS : [singing] O my Lord, I am on the battlefield for my lord .\n\nREV . JACQUELINE DUPREE : My name is Jacqueline Dupree. I'm a pastor in the African Methodist Episcopal Church of Gainesville, Florida. And my hope is to get into the church today. I've been to two of the funerals today, homegoing celebrations. And my thoughts are still a little bit discombobulated. I'm hurting, I'm in pain, just like everybody else. And I pray that out of this tragic, tragic event, that love will still abide. That's been the whole message the whole time, that love overpowers and is more powerful than hate. And I hope that that just continues to happen as we go through these next days and weeks and months, as we mourn the loss of nine beautiful souls. Yeah.\n\nMOURNERS : [singing] We are soldiers in the army We got to fight, although we have to cry We got to hold up the bloodstained banner We got to hold it up until we die.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, as the funerals take place, there's also the controversy over the Confederate flag. Your thoughts on that?\n\nREV . JACQUELINE DUPREE : Take them down. Put them in their proper place, in order that healing and love may continue to flow, flourish and abide.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Just some of the people who came here to Mother Emanuel, to the Emanuel AME Church, to pay their respects on Thursday. When we come back from break, as we await the funeral, the Obamas will be here, Vice President Biden and many tens of-many thousands of others, just around the corner at College of Charleston. We'll be back in a minute with guests here in front of the church. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "You turn to us for voices you won't hear anywhere else.\n\nSign up for Democracy Now!'s Daily Digest to get our latest headlines and stories delivered to your inbox every day.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Our guests today are John Carlos and Dave Zirin. John Carlos has written the book The John Carlos Story: The Sports Moment that Changed the World , with sportswriter Dave Zirin, forward by Cornel West. This is part two of our conversation. We talked about that iconic moment in 1968 in Mexico City, not days after the Tlatelolco massacre that led to how many hundreds, if not more than a thousand people, perhaps 2,000 people, killed right before the Olympics. And there was John Carlos and Tommie Smith with their hand up on the Olympic medal stand in the Black Power salute, without their shoes, protesting poverty, with beads around their neck, protesting lynching. That moment, when you, John Carlos, were on the medal stand, what was the response of the stadium, as the Star-Spangled Banner played?\n\nJOHN CARLOS : Well, it was just like a vision that I had when I was a kid. When we went out and when then national anthem started to play, you know, everyone started to sing. And then, all of a sudden, when we raised our fists, everyone shut up. I mean, when I say \"shut up,\" I mean a total silence in the stadium. That shock went through everyone, and they had to absorb the shock. And then, once-when they came back in to continue singing the national anthem, it wasn't a song anymore. It was something like they were screaming, like \"We're going to shove this anthem down you guys' throat to show you how much we think about you.\" You have to take into account, although the games was in Mexico City, we had a large contingency of United States spectators, and they made their feelings known in that precise moment. Like you say, sunshine left, and the stormy weather came. As we left the victory stand and started back, the boos started coming, the profanity started coming, the trash that was being thrown out in the stands started coming. And I'd see that certain skirmishes was going on inside the stands, because I think people with poverty or low income was in the stadium, as well, and had-I feel that they understood what was going, so it was certain skirmishes taking place, too.\n\nBut it was a bad situation, and I think we were prepared for it. I know I was prepared for it, just based on the vision that God gave me as a kid. However, I didn't take into account, once I return home, that it would affect my wife and my kids. You know, being young, when you do something, you're doing it because you think it's the right thing to do, and sometimes you're more focusing on yourself than focusing on your family. So if I ever had any major regrets about what I did in the Olympics, that would be the regret that I didn't secure my family better.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : How did the rest of the black community-how did the black community respond, though, once you returned to the U.S.?\n\nJOHN CARLOS : Ninety-nine-point-nine percent positive. And that 0.1 percent of those individuals that was old school didn't particularly understand. Old school, that was in the United States military, said-pretty much felt that we set them back or we set the black race back a hundred years. I've heard statements like that from old individuals. But those was few and far in between. Many, many, many, many people had come out in support, in many ways in terms of tears, in terms of saying, \"Man, I love you,\" in terms of saying, \"You're a hero.\" And other individuals throughout the world-you know, you go to Africa, and they call you a god and a king and all that kind of stuff. So it made it very clear that we reached a lot of people, we touched a lot of people.\n\nAnd then, over the years, it had evolved. You know, originally this was a black thing, for people of color, black people who was oppressed. But then, throughout time and travel, you begin to realize that it affected every ethnic group. It wasn't just blacks, or it wasn't just Hispanics. It was affecting people in Czechoslovakia and everywhere that was being oppressed. So it was-that demonstration was for oppressed people across the board.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Your wife committed suicide?\n\nJOHN CARLOS : Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. She couldn't take it no more, you know, having a phone tapped every day, being followed every day, your kids going through changes every day.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What do you mean, phone tapped, being followed?\n\nJOHN CARLOS : Well, you know, the FBI and the CIA , they're some magical people. They can do whatever they want to do with the phone. I'm sure my TV right now is probably looking at me more than I'm looking at it. You know, so, they do things such as that. And, you know, we had to endure, you know, to be followed, to receive anonymous letters stating that your husband did this, your husband did that. It got my wife to the point where she was paranoid. She didn't know what was real and what was Memorex anymore. And it got to the point where it became too much for her, and she decided that she wanted to leave. The biggest hurt for me in my life was that day. And then, the second thing was, what can I do to save my kids, to keep my kids strong and protect my kids? That was my main focus after that, to shelter my kids and give them the best possible opportunity in life to be all that they can be. And God has blessed me there, because I got the greatest kids in the world.\n\nDAVE ZIRIN : You know, Amy, you asked before-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Dave Zirin.\n\nDAVE ZIRIN : Yeah, you asked before about things I learned doing the book. And I was so struck by the level of vindictiveness of the U.S. government in the early, mid-1970s, in terms of how they related to John Carlos, because the movements themselves had died down by that time. John Carlos was just a guy trying to figure out how to scrape together enough money to keep his family together. And yet, still they tailed him. Still they sent letters to the home. Still they made an effort to show their presence in John Carlos and his family's life. Now, why do that, unless you're trying to send a kind of message out there that says, if you cross us, the price will be that severe? I mean, it was COINTELPRO writ large.\n\nAnd it's an ongoing process that-you know, that I think we still do deal with today and that I think a lot of activists in the Occupy movement are reckoning with right now. And I think, frankly, that's one of the reasons why John Carlos was received with such incredible warmth when we were down there at Occupy Wall Street, because there's a sense that he's a fighter, a survivor, and also somebody, as he said that night, who has no regrets.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : It is the most famous image in sports history-\n\nDAVE ZIRIN : Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : -that image of you and Tommie Smith with your hand up in the Black Power salute, as you honored the Olympic Committee for Human Rights. What is that-the Olympic Project for Human Rights. What was that?\n\nJOHN CARLOS : Well, it was a collective group of young individuals that felt like we can have a better society than what was being shown. We felt that all individuals should have an opportunity to get a decent education, all individuals should have an opportunity to live in the area where they feel their finances can take them. We felt that all individuals should have an opportunity to raise their kids in a clean, healthy environment. These are the things that we was concerned about, not just here in the United States, but throughout the world. We were concerned about social issues, as well as Muhammad Ali getting his title back. As Dave said, we was concerned about the fact that as racist and biased as South Africa was at that time with the apartheid, we was concerned about how are you going to open your doors of the Olympics-supposed to have moral character within these sports-and then you're going to allow South Africa and Rhodesia to come in. We had concern about them, just as if I had the same concern about what was happening in China when China was hosting the games. You know, there's moral character that's supposed to be involved in the games, and it seemed like they closed their eyes to it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And Dr. King was with you right-I mean, this is the year, of course, just months before, he was assassinated.\n\nJOHN CARLOS : Dr. King was going to actually come out to be second in command to support the Olympic boycott. That was his wish and his dream.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And the boycott was boycotting..?\n\nJOHN CARLOS : Boycotting the Olympic Games. We chose to say we would prefer to step back and not approach the games at all. After the boycott was called off, I had to search my soul and determine as to whether I was going to go or whether I was going to stay home. I chose to go to the Olympic Games not merely for the Olympic spectrum, in terms of going to win a medal, but I just felt like America was the greatest nation in the world in track and field at that particular time, and another fellow would have got up there and won that medal, and I don't think he would have represented John Carlos the way he felt that he needs to be represented at that time.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Why do you call Peter Norman a hero? He was-he was the silver medalist, on the stage-\n\nJOHN CARLOS : Right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : -on the medal stand with you, wearing the patch of the Olympic Committee for Human Rights.\n\nJOHN CARLOS : Well, you know, I look at it like this. I look at, you know, the beaches of the world. And every grain of sand on these beaches, I think it's a human life involved. I think that God reached down and picked up a grain of sand, said, \"Peter Norman, Tommie Smith and John Carlos.\" I think out of all the other sand that was down there, no one could have been what Peter Norman was. I don't think 10 million individuals would have stepped up and had the courage to say, \"I'm in support of you, and I'll show the world that I'm in support of you by wearing this button.\"\n\nAnd take into account this. When we came back to the United States, everyone was upset. Australia at that time, it was running parallel with South Africa with the way they treated Aboriginal people. When we got back to the United States, Tommie Smith and John Carlos took a terrible whipping. I said, but they can go on one side of town and whip up on Mr. Smith and say, \"Oh, we're tired of beating up him. Let's go on the other side of town and find Carlos and whip up on him.\" But when Mr. Norman left and went back to Australia, it wasn't a switch off. They beat him, and they beat him, and they beat him. But he never denounced us, he never denied us, he never turned his back on us, he never walked away from us, despite the fact that they drove him to alcohol, despite the fact that they drove him to nervous breakdowns, despite the fact that they broke up his family-which they broke all of our families up-despite the fact that they had the Olympic Games to come back to Australia, and the greatest sprinter of all time in Australian history, and not to have a voice or a role in the Olympic Games. Peter Norman is an enormous man.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : He was a white athlete.\n\nJOHN CARLOS : Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.\n\nDAVE ZIRIN : They wouldn't even let him hold a candle at those 2000 Melbourne Games, and they completely shut-and he was the most decorated sprinter in the history of Australia. But the Peter Norman story to me that really captures who he was has to do with when San Jose State built these 23-foot statues of John Carlos and Tommie Smith on their campus. And John can tell the story, or I could tell the story. I know you might want a break, if I could-\n\nJOHN CARLOS : Yeah, well, you go on. You could tell the story.\n\nDAVE ZIRIN : And if I mess it up, you'll tell me?\n\nJOHN CARLOS : I'll fill it in.\n\nDAVE ZIRIN : OK, just checking. Well, they made the decision to make this amazing work of art, these statues on campus. And they were just going to have Tommie Smith and John Carlos, with a blank space where Peter Norman stood. And when John heard about that, he said, \"Oh, no, no. I don't want to be a part of this. And I don't even want this statue if Peter Norman's not going to be on it.\" And the people at San Jose State said, \"Well, Peter said he didn't want to be on it.\" And John said, \"OK, let's go to the president's office and get him on the phone.\" So they called Peter Norman from the president's office at San Jose State, and sure enough, they got Peter on the phone. I believe Peter said-what did he say? \"Blimey, John\"? What did he say?\n\nJOHN CARLOS : Yeah, \"Blimey, John. You're calling me with these blimey questions here?\" And I said to him, I said, \"Pete, I have a concern, man. What's this about you don't want to have your statue there? What, are you backing away from me? Are you ashamed of us?\" And he laughed, and he said, \"No, John.\" He said-you know, the deep thing is, he said, \"Man, I didn't do what you guys did.\" He said, \"But I was there in heart and soul to support what you did. I feel it's only fair that you guys go on and have your statues built there, and I would like to have a blank spot there and have a commemorative plaque stating that I was in that spot. But anyone that comes thereafter from around the world and going to San Jose State that support the movement, what you guys had in '68, they could stand in my spot and take the picture.\" And I think that's the largest thing any man would ever do. And as I said, I don't think that my co-partner, my co-heart, Tommie Smith, would have done what Peter Norman done in that regards. He was just a tremendous individual.\n\nDAVE ZIRIN : And when there are student actions on campus, when there are rallies, that's where students stand to address crowds-the platform, where Peter Norman was on that day. I mean, it-\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : When was the statue built? When were these statues built?\n\nJOHN CARLOS : In 2005, I believe.\n\nDAVE ZIRIN : Five, it's 2005. It was the year before Peter passed away too soon. And-\n\nJOHN CARLOS : They were built by an enormous artist by the name of Rigo 23.\n\nDAVE ZIRIN : Yes.\n\nJOHN CARLOS : He's a world-renowned artist. The students searched high and low. You know, and you sit back and you look at it. They said, \"Well, you know, it's a black activity. We need to find a black artist.\" And my attitude was, no, we need to find the best artist. Mr. Rigo happens to be a white individual, but he is a genius in the work that he does.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So that was 2005, but you stood at the Olympic medal stand in 1968. For those decades, you weren't having monuments built in your honor. Talk about what happened and the jobs you tried to get and couldn't, and the jobs you did get.\n\nJOHN CARLOS : Well, you know, you say I wasn't having monuments built. I think I was having monuments built. But it just wasn't here on this planet. OK, I look at things-everything I do, I look in the eyes of God. And I think God had monuments built based on who I am and what I am and what I'm all about, relative to here in the United States or in the world, for that matter. You know, I think Mr. Smith and John Carlos, I think we were so far ahead of the game, until people had to circumvent their minds and focus and concentrate and have some dialogue and discussion about what had taken place in 1968. That was a very volatile time in the '60s. And then for this to come about, many people had fear. They didn't know what that was. I mean, we had the Black Panthers going through. They were giving the Power sign, as well. So, right, quite naturally, they see us getting to the victory stand. They forgot that we didn't have bullets strapped across our chest, and they forgot that we didn't stick the finger up in the air when we went up there. They forgot that this was a very humble, nonviolent statement that we made. So, you know, in time, people had to gather themselves and put the process through their minds and really have some dialogue and discussion about what this really was. It took 43 years, and we still don't have everybody on board in terms of having some clarity as to what this was all about and why it was necessary. But we have a lot more understanding today than we had back at that time.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Do you have young athletes now coming to you who want to become more politically engaged, seeking your advice?\n\nJOHN CARLOS : Twenty-four/seven. And it's a good thing. What I try and illustrate to many young individuals that-remember, I had just turned 23 years old. I didn't wait until I was 63 or 73 to stand up for what I felt was right. And for you guys to have this image in your mind and want to do something, it's a greater power than me that's registering in your minds and your hearts about trying to stand up for what's right in this society. You know, you sit back and you think about-it's a great thing to get up and lecture to 10,000 people and say, \"Yeah, I'm lecturing to 10,000,\" but I'm only trying to communicate to that one, because that one you can put enough sunshine and love in his heart that he can explode throughout the world with that.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you talk-\n\nDAVE ZIRIN : Mm-hmm.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about the response of athletes, like George Foreman, for example?\n\nJOHN CARLOS : Well, George Foreman is a great individual. See, a lot of people think that George Foreman was a bad guy because George Foreman put the American flag up. You know, I had an American flag on my shirt, as you saw last night. I'm not ashamed of being American. You know, I love America. I was born in America. George is not ashamed of being an American, either. And he waved the flag in the Olympic Games, and he had every right to wave the flag.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In 1968.\n\nJOHN CARLOS : In 1968, right. So a lot of people try and make George-he was opposed to what we did. George wasn't opposed to what we did. He was happy. He was a young individual. And I don't think George was as sophisticated or educated as much about the civil issues, the race relations, you know, coming out of Texas and growing up the way he grew up. I don't think that George was aware nowhere near as much then as he is aware now. You know, and I think George took a lot of unnecessary heat as being the villain, so to speak, on the left. You know, a lot of people on the left thought, oh, George, he disrespected us, or he hurt us, or he didn't stand up for us. Totally wrong. George was a tremendous individual during that time in '68, and he's even greater in life today.\n\nDAVE ZIRIN : I mean, George Foreman grew up with no food on his plate in Texas, with nothing. And I remember interviewing George and him telling me this story about being a young man and being terrified by the things that Muhammad Ali was saying. And I said-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Around...?\n\nDAVE ZIRIN : Oh, around the issue of race and racism. And he said, \"I was terrified when Muhammad Ali, the champion, said he was a Black Muslim.\" And I said, \"Oh, did being a Muslim scare you?\" And he said to me, \"Man, I didn't know what a Muslim was. That didn't scare me. I was scared that he was calling himself black.\" He said, \"We were Negroes. We weren't black. We were colored. We weren't black. It scared me that someone would stand up and say they were black.\" And so, that's where George was coming from when he got to the Olympic Games. But, I mean, the generosity of George Foreman towards John, towards this book, I mean, tells a story all its own, quite frankly.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And other athletes?\n\nDAVE ZIRIN : Oh, my goodness. I mean, it's so interesting, because-\n\nJOHN CARLOS : Well, let me just say this about-\n\nDAVE ZIRIN : Bill Russell.\n\nJOHN CARLOS : Let me say-well, Bill Russell is a soldier in arms. Jim Brown, another soldier in arms. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, another soldier in arms. But when you sit back and you think about the athletes in general, those individuals that was young enough to make that Olympic team, you know, in retrospect, when you sit back now and you look at it, and many individuals come back now and they want to be in the picture. You know, they want to be remembered that, \"Hey, man, I was in that era.\" When the statues were built, a lot of students came by, student athletes that was dealing with me, came back and said, \"Man, we should have a brick with our name on the base of it.\"\n\nAnd I tell them, I say, \"You know, I love you guys, and I'll love you 'til the end.\" I said, \"But relative to you getting in the picture, you can't get in the picture. Relative to you having a rock with your name on it, you can't have that.\" And they didn't understand. I said, \"Well, let me explain it to you.\" I said, \"When we were young, we were idealistic, and we had a dream that we could make the society a better place for all people. So we chose to say, how will we bring attention to this plight? Let's propose an Olympic boycott.\" Well, a lot of people didn't understand the effort and the need for a boycott.\n\nSo we got on this train, and on this train we're rolling down the track. And as we're rolling down the track, people were now talking about, \"Yeah! America! Bring home the gold!\" Everybody was excited. But we on the train, we're trying to educate these individuals as to why we thought it was necessary to have an Olympic boycott, opposed to you having your 15 minutes in the sun. So, a lot of them came around and said, \"Well, we understand. So let's take a vote. Alright, we vote that we're going to attempt to do this boycott.\" So, oh, we agree? We're going to attempt to do it? We stopped the train. We got out. We put banners all up and down the train: \"1968 Olympic boycott proposal.\" Now all of those people that was out there waving before we put those signs up, they're gone. But as we're rolling down the track, now the missiles started coming, the firebombs started coming, hitting the train. This is all in theory, right? Hitting this train. And bang, all of a sudden, there's smoke and there's fire. And then I start to see people bailing, bailing out.\n\nAnd now, 43 years later, people want to come back and say, \"I deserve to be in the picture. I deserve to have that rock.\" And I tell them, I say, \"Well, if you deserve to have it, open your shirt. Let me see your burns. Pull up your pants leg. Let me see your burns. Show me the burns on your back, on your hands or your arm.\" I said, \"Mr. Smith did show me his. Show them, Tommie.\" I said, \"You want to see mine? If you didn't have burns on you, you bailed the ship. Now you want to come back? You can't stand in the picture, because we can't change the course of history. We're going to love you for the end of time.\" But when you sit back now, people were reflecting, because we're old men now-we're reflecting on the crossroads that we had in life to make a critical decision. Now people are sitting back, saying, \"Wow\" -yeah, my grandkid, my grandson, my granddaughter asked me. They say, \"Pop pop, wasn't you in those Olympic Games? What did you do?\" So, it's a critical time for us in our senior years right now in terms of whether we made the right decisions or the wrong decisions.\n\nDAVE ZIRIN : I have to say, that's exactly what John Carlos said down at Occupy Wall Street to all the young people there, and it really connected. It was a remarkable thing to see that kind of generational tranference, where John said to them, \"This is your crossroads. And just like Mexico City was the ultimate platform for me to be seen and heard in 1968, the ultimate platform, the ultimate beacon today, is down there at Wall Street. And you guys are on the right side of history right now, and you will thank yourself that you are making this choice.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The women athlete at the time, in 1968?\n\nDAVE ZIRIN : Yeah, the women athletes-we talk about this at great length in the book, because this was a problem John had with a lot of the Olympic Project for Human Rights, was that there wasn't outreach made to women athletes. And particularly some of the women athletes were far more courageous than many of the male athletes, both on issues of gender and on issues of race and racism. And this showed itself after the women won the four-by-100. They won the gold medal relay. And the captain of that relay, Wyomia Tyus, who was a athletic giant, a two-time gold medal winner in the hundred-meter dash-\n\nJOHN CARLOS : The first.\n\nDAVE ZIRIN : The first ever.\n\nJOHN CARLOS : The first 200-two-time winner, back-to-back hundred-meter champion.\n\nDAVE ZIRIN : Yeah, first ever. Wyomia Tyus. She held up her gold medal at the press conference. And remember, this is in the context of John Carlos and Tommie Smith, quote-unquote, \"getting stripped of their medals\" and getting kicked out of Mexico and being these evil dragons. And Wyomia Tyus held up her medal and said, \"We dedicate these gold medals to John Carlos and Tommie Smith.\"\n\nJOHN CARLOS : Tremendous. And I might add, that was watered down, because they didn't want that to get out, so the media just kind of discarded that, pushed it to the side.\n\nDAVE ZIRIN : Once again.\n\nJOHN CARLOS : But we felt that a lot of women were very strong, and we just feel very sorry that there wasn't-more inclusive into the whole production of the Olympic Project for Human Rights.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And John Carlos, the significance of having your-well, writing your story, together with Dave Zirin, having a book called The John Carlos Story ?\n\nJOHN CARLOS : Well, I think the significance is, as-I believe it was the young fellow that just died from Apple. He made a statement that was-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Steve Jobs.\n\nJOHN CARLOS : Steve Jobs, right. His statement was profound in terms of saying, I wanted my voice to be heard by my kids and my grandkids. There's so many stories written about John Carlos, stories written directly about me or indirectly about me. None of these individuals called me on the phone or came and sat down with me to have a discussion. Most of the articles that were written or books that were written were written off of articles that was in the paper. Most of the articles in the paper were bogus articles. So, therefore, I felt it was imperative, based on the fact that I'm getting older, I'm starting to forget a lot of things, my eyes are not as sharp as they used to be-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : How old are you now?\n\nJOHN CARLOS : Sixty-six. And that's a long way from 23. So, you know, I felt like, before I lose it all, I want to get with the right person in life and do this book for my kids and all of their peers and their grandkids and all of their peers, as well, because I think it's a remarkable life that God-the roller coaster God put me on, and I'm here to tell them about it. I think it's a marvelous situation for Dave Zirin and I to come together. I think we-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : How did you come together?\n\nDAVE ZIRIN : Oh, goodness. Can I tell this?\n\nJOHN CARLOS : Yes.\n\nDAVE ZIRIN : Alright. I mean, this is-this is real. And this is actually part of the story, is, in 2003, I was working for a small town newspaper, African-American-owned newspaper, and it was the 35th anniversary of the '68 protests. And I thought, \"Wow, I want to try to interview John Carlos,\" because that image was something that was in my college dorm room. So, I Google-searched \"John Carlos,\" and up comes a web page, and it has a phone number at the bottom of it. So I figure, \"Oh, this must be some sort of management service or something.\" I called the phone number. I hear, \"Hello.\" And I say, \"Yeah, I'm trying to get in touch to talk to John Carlos.\" He goes, \"This is Carlos. Who's this?\" And I was like, \"Uh, uh, uh, can I call you back? I've got to write questions down.\" Like I just couldn't believe that John was that accessible. But-and John has been working the last several decades in the public school system in California as a guidance counselor. So I was actually catching John in his office at school, with these students running in and out and whatnot. And it was-it was amazing to talk to him.\n\nAnd actually, it was very lucky, because I got to speak with him right before this recent kind of ESPN revisionism, where it's like, \"Oh, let's re-embrace John Carlos and Tommie Smith. Let's appreciate what they did.\" And so, I was able to talk to John and really get this kind of unvarnished sense of, \"Wow, you know, I'm not treated like a hero now,\" as he said to me in 2003. \"I'm treated like somebody, if you ever know somebody who survives cancer, where it's like people are sort of like slightly wary of you and say, like, 'I'm so glad you're well,' and then step away.\" And it's that sense that John gave me in that call, started a relationship.\n\nAnd then we spoke together on a couple of panels. And John is-and John, you can shut your ears if you don't want me to swell your head. John is one of the most gifted public speakers I've ever seen. And so, at that moment when we would go out and do these talks together, I was like, how great would it be if we could go out on a book tour together? And without me even saying that, John then approached me and said, \"You need to write my book.\" So I was just like, \"Hmmm, I was thinking that.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, tell us about your life, John. What happened after you came back from the Olympics?\n\nJOHN CARLOS : Well, I think the main focus when I came back was to realize that I was in this storm, and the main focus within that storm was to do whatever is necessary to do to support your family. You know, I had individuals come to me with drugs in my house and tell me, \"Man, it's going to be rough. Go that way.\" I looked at them. I said, \"I appreciate it. Thanks, but no thanks. Y'all can move on with that.\" I had to take jobs as security guards in night clubs and so forth [inaudible].\n\nAMY GOODMAN : No endorsement offers?\n\nJOHN CARLOS : No one had endorsement opportunities before 1968. The great Wilma Rudolph never had endorsements. The great Jesse Owens, long after he became this hero, after they recognized his greatness, he never had endorsements. Endorsements came about after 1968, after we went to the victory stand. Relative to endorsements for John Carlos, it was unheard of. And, you know, I was in the zone where they was saying, \"Burn your draft card. We don't want you.\" You know, so those things never materialized for me. But you had to still-it wasn't meant to materialize for John Carlos. It was meant to materialize for the young athletes that came after, just like this demonstration wasn't meant particularly for John Carlos at that moment, because things wasn't going to change overnight. But it was meant for to be a better opportunity for young kids and my kids and their peers after me.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, you were a guidance counselor?\n\nJOHN CARLOS : Yes. I just like working with kids, because kids keep you young. You can give them a vision as to how they can build their foundation in life. I think that, through all, I was a very piss-poor student-couldn't spell, couldn't write, couldn't do any of that. But I realized when I was a kid-they used to say-you didn't have dyslexia, you're just dummy. And they would put the \"dummy\" down the center of your head and put you in the corner for the world to see. But I knew I was smarter than a lot of individuals out there. But I felt that my greatest asset was to build a foundation around education, even with the frailties that I had at that particular time. And I invest that time in young kids and making them understand, if you want to be successful in life, you have to build that foundation in terms of education.\n\nAnd I always use, you know, certain quaint little phrases, you know, to get their attention, like, \"Do you go to school, or do you go through school? You know, listen to what I said now: do you go to or through?\" And then I say to them, I say, \"You know something? What happens to you when you don't eat?\" Some say, \"Well, you get sick.\" I say, \"No, you don't get sick. You die. If you don't eat, you die.\" I say, \"Now, what happens if you don't eat education?\" I say, \"because education is food for life. I say, \"If you don't eat education,\" I say, \"what happens to you then?\" \"Well, you die.\" I say, \"No, you don't die. You wish you was dead, because you have a bad life for the rest of your life.\" So, these are the things that I do in terms of trying to illustrate to kids the value of them going and building their education, because when you have knowledge, you can go anywhere on the planet and stand on your own.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Do you think that kind of knowledge necessarily makes you political, though, the kind of education that children receive?\n\nJOHN CARLOS : Well, it depends upon how well you know the man in the mirror. You know, what floats your boat. You understand? If I know me, and I know that I'm doing well, but everyone around me is doing poorly, then I want to say, \"Why is it that I'm doing so well, and they're doing so bad?\" You know, like a guy came to me one time to try and buy me-a government official. \"John, what do you want?\" That was the question he asked. \"What do you want?\" You know, I'm young. It blew me away. What do I want? No one has ever asked me this question. I thought about it for a second. I said to him, I said, \"You know, I can't ask you for every black person or person of color in the world that you give them what you offered me,\" because they offered me the big house on the hill, whatever car I wanted, plus millions in the bank. And I said to him, I said, \"You know, I can't be concerned about everybody in the world.\" I said, \"But if you're going to give it to me, all the black people up and down my street, you've got to give them the same thing.\" And he looked at me, and he said, \"Why?\" I said, \"Because if you give it to me, that means my wife and-my wife and I, we would have to cater to them, have them come to our house for the barbecue or come to our house for the dinner, come to our house for the social activity, get in our pool.\" I said, \"My wife and I would like to go to their house and get in their pool and go to their house and have the social dinner, too. So, open up the gate and give everybody the same opportunity you're offering me.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Tell us about the ESPN special. What was that about?\n\nJOHN CARLOS : Well, I think ESPN had a great vision as to how we can honor these individuals, as well as maybe put the light on us, as well as doing something remarkably well by bringing Tommie Smith and John Carlos to the forum as the greatest courage individuals of that decade or of the century, so to speak. It was a great experience for my wife. It was a great experience for my kids. It was a great experience for Tommie Smith and John Carlos to be honored by their peers. All of the greatest athletes were in there that night. They all stood and gave homage to us.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Where?\n\nJOHN CARLOS : In Los Angeles, California, at the-\n\nDAVE ZIRIN : Yeah, the ESPY Awards.\n\nJOHN CARLOS : Yeah, the ESPY Awards was-what's the arena? The-something new stadium they have down there, next to Staples Center.\n\nDAVE ZIRIN : Yeah, Staples Center. Staples Center, yeah.\n\nJOHN CARLOS : But it was a terrific opportunity. And my grandson had an opportunity to take part and be there and experience this thing. It was as spellbinding for me that night as it was for my grandkids to come to the first book signing, as well. So, you know, I mean, if you stay in the game long enough, and enough people wake up, your day will come. And it's a lot bigger than 15 minutes.\n\nDAVE ZIRIN : There's an interesting moment that happened a couple of months later that was connected to ESPN , where a football player for the Denver Broncos named Brandon Marshall said that if he scored a touchdown on an ESPN Sunday night game, he was going to take out a glove that would be half-black and half-white and raise it to the heavens. And it was going to be to commemorate the election of Barack Obama and be a symbol of how far we've come but how far we still need to go, hence half-black, half-white. That was just his thinking about it. And at the game itself, he did score a touchdown, but it was in the last 30 seconds, and his team-you would get a penalty for doing that on the field, and his teammates told him, \"You can't do it. You can't do it.\" So he took the glove out and then just put it back in his pants. And then, after the game, Brandon Marshall was crying, because he said, \"I wish I had done it. You know, I wish I had done it.\" And they went back to the ESPN SportsCenter, and they started openly mocking Brandon Marshall and making fun of him for having this idea. They said-they called him names. They made fun of his intelligence, and they said, \"This guy needs a better speechwriter.\"\n\nAnd I thought that this really says a lot, because it's so easy to honor the past and dress yourself up in the courage of the past. It's a lot harder when you have to make these decisions in the present. Like, take Bud Selig, who's the commissioner of Major League Baseball. Every year he honors Jackie Robinson and his courage. But when it came time to take a stand against moving the all-star game from Arizona because of their laws against Latino immigrants, Bud Selig was nowhere to be found.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

In the 1927 case Buck v. Bell, the court upheld a statute that enabled the state of Virginia to sterilize so-called mental defectives or imbeciles. The person in question was Carrie Buck, a poor, young woman then confined in the Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and the Feebleminded, though she was neither epileptic nor mentally disabled. In the landmark decision, eight judges ruled that the state of Virginia had the right to sterilize her. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. wrote the majority opinion concluding, \"Three generations of imbeciles are enough.\" The decision resulted in 60,000 to 70,000 sterilizations of Americans considered \"unfit\" to reproduce. At the Nuremberg trials, lawyers for Nazi scientists cited the opinion in defense of their actions. We speak to Adam Cohen, author of \"Imbeciles: The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck.\"\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : We turn now to look at what's been described as one of the worst Supreme Court rulings in history. In the 1927 case Buck v. Bell , the court upheld a statute that enabled the state of Virginia to sterilize so-called mental defectives or imbeciles. The person in question was Carrie Buck, a poor, young woman then confined in the Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and the Feebleminded, though she was neither epileptic nor mentally disabled. In the landmark decision, eight judges ruled that the state of Virginia had the right to sterilize her. Her mother, Emma, as well as Carrie's daughter, Vivian, then only eight months old, were deemed similarly deficient. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. wrote the majority opinion concluding, quote, \"Three generations of imbeciles are enough.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The decision resulted in 60,000 to 70,000 sterilizations of Americans considered \"unfit\" to reproduce. The Supreme Court decision had its origins in the eugenics movement then thriving in the United States. The 1924 Immigration Act was passed with similar intent-to prevent immigration by genetically inferior groups, which included Italians, Jews, Eastern Europeans and countless others, in an attempt to improve the genetic quality of the American population.\n\nAuthor Adam Cohen writes about the case in his new book, Imbeciles: The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck . Adam was previously a member of The New York Times editorial board and a senior writer for Time magazine. He is the co-editor of TheNationalBookReview.com .\n\nAdam Cohen, welcome back to Democracy Now! It's great to have you with us.\n\nADAM COHEN : Great to be here, Amy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Tell us the story of Carrie Buck. In a moment, we'll hear all about how it ties into immigration, eugenics, parallels to what we're seeing today. But start back in the 1920s with Carrie Buck.\n\nADAM COHEN : So she's a young woman who is growing up in Charlottesville, Virginia, being raised by a single mother. Back then, there was a belief that it was better often to take poor children away from their parents and put them in middle-class homes. So she was put in a foster family that treated her very badly. She wasn't allowed to call the parents \"mother\" and \"father.\" She did a lot of housekeeping for them and was rented out to the neighbors. And then, one summer, she was raped by the nephew of her foster mother. She becomes pregnant out of wedlock. And rather than help her with this pregnancy, they decide to get her declared epileptic and feebleminded, though she was neither, and she's shipped off to the Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded outside of Lynchburg, Virginia.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And what happened to her there?\n\nADAM COHEN : So she gets there at just the wrong time. Virginia has just passed an eugenics sterilization law, and they want to test it in the courts. So they seize on Carrie Buck as the perfect plaintiff in this lawsuit. So they decide to make her the first person in Virginia who will be eugenically sterilized, and suddenly she's in the middle of a case that's headed to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : And, Adam Cohen, could you explain what kind of medical tests were employed to determine that she was a so-called imbecile?\n\nADAM COHEN : Yeah, terrible testing. These were very primitive IQ tests from the time, that really didn't test intelligence at all. One question she was asked was: What do you do when a playmate hits you? And whatever her answer was to that was somehow deemed to be relevant to whether or not she was an idiot, an imbecile or a moron.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Those were the categories?\n\nADAM COHEN : Yes, those were the three categories. And this was a formal hierarchy that was established by the psychological profession at the time and was actually in government pamphlets. So, if you were of a mental age of two or younger, you were called an idiot. If you were between three and seven, you were called an imbecile. And if you were eight and-from between eight and 12, you were called a moron. And Carrie and her mother, who was also at the colony, were deemed to be morons.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : And so, explain what happened to Carrie after that.\n\nADAM COHEN : Yeah, so, they decide to put her in the middle of this test case to see if the Virginia law is constitutional. And they give her a lawyer who's actually not on her side. It's a former chairman of the Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded's own board of directors. He clearly wants to see her sterilized. He does a terrible job writing short briefs that don't cite the relevant cases. It goes up to the Supreme Court, and the court rules eight to one that, yes, the Virginia law is constitutional, and, yes, Carrie, who there's nothing wrong with, should be sterilized against her will.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : And who was responsible for appointing this lawyer to her?\n\nADAM COHEN : It was the colony itself, so they chose one of their friends. And she truly had no advocate of any kind on her side. Back then, the American Civil Liberties Union, which had just started up, really was kind of pro-eugenics, or at least some of the members around it were, and there were no advocacy groups to look out for people like Carrie.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, explain what this term \"eugenics\" was, what the whole movement was, and who was a part of it, Adam.\n\nADAM COHEN : Sure. So, it started in England by-it was-the phrase-the word was coined by Francis Galton, who was a half-cousin of Charles Darwin. So this was right after Darwin had discovered evolution and survival of the fittest. Galton and his followers said, \"Well, if nature does this naturally, we can speed survival of the fittest along if we decide who gets to reproduce and who doesn't, if we get the fit people to reproduce and we stop the unfit from reproducing.\" So that was the idea in England.\n\nIt comes over to America, and it's greatly adopted by the leaders in America. I mean, the people who supported eugenics included the president of Harvard University, the first president of Stanford, Theodore Roosevelt, Alexander Graham Bell. And universities across the country taught eugenics. It was very popular in the popular press and in best-selling books. This was a mass movement. People believed we needed to uplift the race by changing our gene pool.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Where did Margaret Sanger fit into this picture?\n\nADAM COHEN : She was a eugenicist. And this is a big controversy, where exactly she fit in. She wasn't a leader in the movement. She was, in part, a-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And explain who she was.\n\nADAM COHEN : Sure. Margaret Sanger was the founder of Planned Parenthood. She formed a strategic alliance with the eugenicists, in part to get more support for her birth control movement. But she also believed some of this stuff, and she said some bad things at the time. This is a big controversy, though. And on the right, they use it to taint the whole idea of Planned Parenthood, which I think is unfair, because Margaret Sanger was actually in the mainstream of a lot of progressive thought at the time.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : As is evidenced by the Supreme Court decision.\n\nADAM COHEN : Eight to one.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Now, explain who was on the Supreme Court, who wrote the decision, what these justices believed themselves.\n\nADAM COHEN : Yeah, so this was actually a very fancy court at the time. The chief justice was William Howard Taft, who had been president of the United States before he became chief justice, the only president to do that. He had also been a professor at Yale Law School. Louis Brandeis, who was known as \"the people's attorney\" before he joined the court, a great progressive hero, he was on the court. And then, of course, Oliver Wendell Holmes, probably the most revered justice in American history, he was a legendary figure. There have been-there's a movie about him. There was a play on Broadway, cover of Time magazine. He was thought to be the wisest of the judges. And he wrote this terrible decision.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, I want to go to something that he said in the decision. This is Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., who wrote in the majority opinion for the court, the nation must sterilize those who, quote, \"sap the strength of the State [to] prevent our being swamped with incompetence.\" He declared, quote, \"It is better for all the world if, instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind.\"\n\nADAM COHEN : Very shocking. Sorry, yeah.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : So I wanted to ask you about the fact-you studied Harvard Law School. And at the time, this justice was considered a hero of the American legal system. So could you explain who he was, what kinds of positions he took, and how he was still revered?\n\nADAM COHEN : Sure. He was a heroic figure. He had actually been a professor at Harvard Law School before he joined the U.S. Supreme Court. And even when I was at Harvard Law school, there were portraits of him everywhere. He's still a very revered justice.\n\nBut he came out of a certain tradition. He was a so-called Boston Brahmin. He was from some of the fanciest families in Boston. The Olivers, Wendells and the Holmes were all old New England families. He was raised by a father, Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., who had been the dean of Harvard Medical School. Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. actually coined this phrase \"Boston Brahmin.\" And the idea was that these fancy families in Boston were like the Brahmins in India, that they were the highest caste.\n\nSo he believed this. He wrote about eugenics even before this case came along, wrote about it favorably. So when the case gets to him, he believes that people like Carrie Buck-poor, white, uneducated people-are much lesser than him, so it's very natural for him to say, \"Of course we don't need more people like Carrie Buck; we need more people like me and my Boston Brahmin neighbors.\" So that was the philosophy.\n\nAnd it is amazing that, to this day, he's still revered in law schools, because these were some pretty repugnant views. But one reason that can still be the case is that this case is not talked about. When I took constitutional law at Harvard Law School, it was not taught. The leading American constitutional treatise, 1,700 pages that goes into great detail about many, many cases, has half a sentence about Buck v. Bell . They've just sort of forgotten about it and made it not part of Holmes's legacy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Where do the Nazis fit into this picture, Adam Cohen?\n\nADAM COHEN : Yeah, so one of the shocking things about that is that the Nazis actually followed us. We were the leaders in eugenic sterilization. Indiana passed a eugenic sterilization law in 1907, well before the rise of the Nazi Party. They were looking to America. And one of the villains in my book is a man named Harry Laughlin, who runs the-ran the Eugenics Record Office on Long Island. And he was in correspondence with the Nazi scientists throughout this whole period. They were looking to him for advice about how to set up a eugenics sterilization program. He wrote with pride in his eugenics magazine that they based the Nazi eugenic law on his American law.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, can you explain-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So that's key.\n\nADAM COHEN : Absolutely.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're not talking about Americans looking to the Nazis, who supported the Nazis. We're talking about the Nazis using American precedent.\n\nADAM COHEN : Absolutely. And it's shocking also the degree to which there was friendship and cooperation between the America eugenicists and important scientists in America and the Nazis. So, Harry Laughlin, this villain of the book, he actually is given a honorary degree from the University of Heidelberg in 1936. That's a year after they purged all the Jews from the faculty. He was fine with that, because he was actually a Nazi sympathizer.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Let's go to a break, and when we come back, we're going to continue on this discussion. We'll talk about the U.S. model being a model for the Nazis, but also then how immigration law fits into this picture and what are the parallels with today. We're talking with Adam Cohen, journalist and lawyer, previously a member of The New York Times editorial board and senior writer for Time magazine. His brand new book is called Imbeciles: The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck . Stay with us.\n\n[break]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Coon Creek Girls, \"Flowers Blooming in the Wildwood.\" This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh. Our guest is Adam Cohen, author of the new book, Imbeciles: The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck . Nermeen?\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : So I wanted to turn to a clip from the 1961 film Judgment at Nuremberg , which references the 1927 case, Buck v. Bell . This clip begins with Maximilian Schell playing German defense attorney Hans Rolfe. Then we hear from John Wengraf playing Dr. Karl Wieck, former minister of justice in Weimar Germany.\n\nHANS ROLFE : [played by Maximilian Schell] \"Society can prevent their propagation by medical means in the first place. Three generations of imbeciles are enough.\" You recognize it now, Dr. Wieck?\n\nDR. KARL WIECK : [played by John Wengraf] No, sir, I don't.\n\nHANS ROLFE : Actually, there is no particular reason you should, since the opinion upholds a sterilization law in the state of Virginia, of the United States, and was written and delivered by that great American jurist, Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : That was a clip from the film Judgment at Nuremberg . So, Adam Cohen, in this film, they actually cite Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes.\n\nADAM COHEN : And this happened in history, as well. This happened at the actual Nuremberg trials. So, after World War II, we put the leading Nazis on trial for some of the worst things that the Nazis did. One of those very bad things was they set up a eugenics program where they sterilized as many as 375,000 people. So we put them on trial for that. And lo and behold, as the movie shows, their defense was: \"How can you put us on trial for that? Your own U.S. Supreme Court said that sterilization was constitutional, was good. And it was your own Oliver Wendell Holmes, one of your most revered figures, who said that. So, why are we the bad guys in this story?\" They had a point.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : So can you explain when and why the eugenics movement took hold in the U.S.?\n\nADAM COHEN : Yeah. So, it came over in the early '10s and '20s, 1910s and 1920s. This was actually a very nervous time. You know, you see movies now about the 1920s, you see flappers and Prohibition and parties. But America was actually at a time of quiet turmoil. There were the highest rates of immigration that there had been in American history, so the nation's cities were flooded with new immigrants, often with different religions, different nationalities from the people who were already here. Also, people were leaving the farms and moving to the cities. So it was a time of instability. And historians suggest that in this time of instability, the upper classes, the Anglo-Saxons in the United States, wanted to somehow control a changing country. And the way they saw of controlling it was eugenics: \"We need to firm up our gene pool.\" So it was that anxiety that got moved into this eugenics movement. And they combined it with the new science of genetics that was emerging, and they came up with these crazy sterilization laws.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, at the time, the establishment of the United States saw the threat as the mass of immigration, the waves of immigration of Jews, of Italians.\n\nADAM COHEN : Yes, and there were best-selling books, a book by Madison Grant called The Passing of the Great Race . And this was about how whites around the world were in danger. They were being swamped by the so-called colored people everywhere. These were real anxieties, adopted at the highest levels. And in The Great Gatsby , there's actually a scene in which Daisy Buchanan's husband Tom, at a party, begins going off about this book he's read about how the colored people are taking over the world. That actually was representative of the fears of the upper classes of America. And it got channeled into eugenics.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : A few years after leaving the White House, President Theodore Roosevelt wrote in a magazine, quote, \"I wish very much that the wrong people could be prevented entirely from breeding ... Feeble-minded persons [should be] forbidden to leave offspring behind them.\"\n\nADAM COHEN : He did say that. And, you know, I was on the Amtrak the other day, and I just happened to be sitting next to a revered American historian, Richard Reeves, and we were talking about this. And he had just finished a book about the Japanese interment. And he said he was shocked to learn that FDR was actually a eugenicist, too. And one of the things animating the Japanese interment was that FDR thought that the Japanese were, you know, inferior. So this was widely held by people that we as a country still admire.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, in your book, you also talk about the U.S. 1924 Immigration Act and how it was praised by Hitler in Mein Kampf . So could you talk about the act itself and how it was linked to this growing support for eugenics?\n\nADAM COHEN : Yes, it was largely, in large part, motivated by eugenics. So, this hero-this villain of the book that I mentioned, Harry Laughlin, he was actually appointed expert eugenics agent to Congress. There's letterhead from the U.S. House Committee on Immigration that says \"expert eugenics agent.\" He testified about the eugenic advantages and disadvantages of various nationalities, and he persuaded Congress that Eastern European Jews, Italians, Asians were genetically inferior and we had to keep them out. That ends up being translated into the 1924 law, which puts in place for the first time national quotas. So you can no longer just show up at Ellis Island. If you're coming from some countries, we don't want you. If you're coming from England and northern Europe, we do want you. So, this ended up completely changing the national composition of immigration, and it was because certain people were deemed to be inferior.\n\nAnd one thing that I thought about when I wrote the book is, when we read The Diary of Anne Frank and we realize that she died in a concentration camp, we think about how the Nazis thought the Jews were a lesser race, and that's why they were put in concentration camps. What we don't think about it is, Anne Frank's father was actually trying to get her and the family to America. He was writing repeatedly to the State Department for visas. He was turned down. He was turned down because of this 1924 act. So when we hear that Anne Frank died in a concentration camp, it's also because the U.S. Congress, like the Nazis, thought the Jews were an inferior race.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Now, interestingly, on the Supreme Court and one of those who believed in eugenics, was the Jewish Supreme Court justice, Louis Brandeis?\n\nADAM COHEN : That's absolutely right. And, you know, it's one of the great mysteries, is why someone like that would take that view. And Louis Brandeis never talked about it. And again, it's part of our history that's been airbrushed out. When I started working on this book, I was very excited to get a major biography of Louis Brandeis, written by a very respected law professor, 900 pages. And I was looking to see how he explains this. It only mentions Buck v. Bell in a footnote. No one wants to talk about this part of Louis Brandeis's legal career.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, Buck v. Bell was decided eight to one, so who was the one dissenting judge?\n\nADAM COHEN : The one dissenting judge was actually the one Catholic on the court. And interestingly, the one group that really did oppose the eugenics movement was the Catholic Church. They believe both in the idea of reproduction, which we see in the abortion issue, but also they believe that people should be judged on their spiritual qualities, on who they are inside, not by these external qualities that the eugenicists were focusing on. So, when there were sterilization law bills that were put up before legislatures around the country, the one group that would consistently show up to oppose them was Catholics-nuns, priests, Catholic laypeople. And there were states like Louisiana with large Catholic populations, where bills were voted down really because of the opposition of the Catholic Church.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, let's talk about sterilization. What actually happened to-we're talking about up to 70,000 people, mainly women, but a number of men? What were the operations they were put through? Where did this happen?\n\nADAM COHEN : Yeah, it's kind of barbaric to think about. And actually, before, in the early stage of eugenics, it started out with castration. And the eugenicists were having trouble getting legislatures to adopt eugenic sterilization laws, because people didn't like the idea of actually castrating people. And it was actually the medical advances-the rise of the vasectomy and the salpingectomy, which is what was done to women, the cauterizing of the Fallopian tubes-that made it a little bit more palatable. But these were still terrible operations, and you can imagine what surgery was like in the 1920s. So someone like Carrie Buck was sterilized at the Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded by the man, the doctor, who was the superintendent of the colony, and it was a terribly invasive operation. She had to recover for two weeks. They cut her open. And, you know, all kinds of anesthesia and medical procedures were rather primitive then.\n\nSo this is what the government was doing. I mean, you think about governmental invasion of your rights. Now we're concerned, as we should be, about the government, you know, reading our emails and listening in to our phone calls. They are operating on women and men in this most barbaric way. And, I mean, it's really shocking. And as we've seen, the Supreme Court, eight to one, said not only that this is fine, but the Supreme Court encouraged the nation to do more. It said, you know, not only is the Virginia law constitutional, not only is it OK to sterilize Carrie Buck, we need more of these operations.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So first it's the vilification of immigrants, and then it's this step.\n\nADAM COHEN : Yes. You know, the eugenicists were trying to protect the gene pool, so they saw an external threat and an internal threat, and they were addressing them at the same time. Externally, they thought these lesser people are coming into the country, they're going to harm our gene pool, we have to keep them out. And internally, they started looking around the country and asking, \"Who are the people here who have bad genes who we need to eliminate?\" So, they looked at people like Carrie Buck, who was poor, who was undereducated, and they said, \"That's the kind of people we need to stop internally.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What happened to Carrie Buck afterwards?\n\nADAM COHEN : Well, you know, her story is so sad. So, she did have a baby that was a result of this rape that ended up putting her in the Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded. They had promised her throughout the proceeding-and this is in the legal briefs-that one good thing about her being sterilized is she would be returned to her foster family, which was actually raising her baby, so at least she would be able to spend her life raising her daughter Vivian. But, in fact, as soon as they get the court order that she can be sterilized and she's sterilized, they ask the Dobbs family, her foster family, to take her back, and the Dobbs family said, \"Well, no, actually, we don't want her.\" So she doesn't get to live with her baby. And then she gets put in a series of household placements, where she becomes a housekeeper. She marries a couple of times. But she always wanted babies. And at the end of her life, she said that she really wished she had had a family, and she didn't.\n\nAnd one other sad part of the story is that people who knew her later in life said she absolutely was not feebleminded. When she was at a retirement home, she loved getting the newspaper every day, and she used to work on the crossword puzzle.\n\nAnd one other sad-there are so many sad parts of the story, but she had a sister, Doris, who was also at the colony. Doris was sterilized shortly after she was. Years later, when she was an old woman, she wanted to get Social Security, and she wrote to the colony to find out how old she was, because she didn't know. And the colony director came and visited her and told her that she was old enough for Social Security. He also told her that she had been sterilized. She and her husband began crying, because they had been trying their whole lives to have children. No one had ever told her that the government had sterilized her. She had been told that she had an appendectomy. And when she went to the doctor, he said, \"You have this scar.\" And she said, \"Yeah, it's because they did an appendectomy on me.\" They had actually sterilized her, and her whole life, she never knew.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, last your, Virginia agreed to compensate victims of state-sponsored forced sterilization. The state agreed to pay each surviving victim $25,000. Lewis Reynolds is among those who received compensation. At the age of 13, Reynolds was incorrectly diagnosed with epilepsy, resulting in his forced sterilization. Reynolds wasn't even aware that the state had conducted the operation until he and his wife encountered trouble starting a family years later. Reynolds spoke to RT about the pain of never being able to have children.\n\nLEWIS REYNOLDS : I would love to have had a family and children and grandchildren, too. And I wonder sometimes what would I be like, a father to my children, if I could have any-excuse me-and play with them and everything, just like everybody else does.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : That was Lewis Reynolds speaking to RT, a victim, one of the many surviving victims of forced sterilization. So could you talk about Virginia's decision to compensate victims, surviving victims? And also, much like Carrie Buck, Lewis Reynolds also wasn't told that he had been subjected to forced sterilization. So why did the government not tell people that this is what they were doing?\n\nADAM COHEN : Well, I don't think that they wanted opposition, right? It's much easier to sterilize someone against their will if you don't tell them what's going on. As with Doris Buck, they said, you know, \"You have a medical problem. You have appendicitis. We have to operate on you.\" You know, if you say, \"We want to stop you from having children,\" maybe you get some pushback. So I think it was easier for the doctors involved.\n\nAnd then, yeah, they have begun a process of reparations, but it was so slow in coming. On the 75th anniversary of this case, in 2002, the governor Virginia apologized for the sterilizations that occurred, but they didn't begin to compensate people then. They just did that this year. So, as a result, I was actually in Virginia yesterday, and someone told me that what they had heard is that only eight people so far have actually applied for reparations, because so many have died now. If you think about all the people who were sterilized in the 1920s and 1930s, they lived their whole lives and died never being in any way compensated.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What happened with the law upheld by Buck v. Bell ?\n\nADAM COHEN : So it actually remained in place for a long time. There was a lot more sterilization after the Supreme Court ruling. Other states began to adopt such laws. Mississippi passed a eugenic sterilization law in 1928. Virginia kept its on the books until the 1970s, and it was actually sterilizing people through the 1970s.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And Buck v. Bell itself?\n\nADAM COHEN : Is still the law the land. In 1942, the Supreme Court got another eugenic sterilization case, out of Oklahoma. They had the opportunity to overturn Buck v. Bell . You might think they would have, because at that point we were at war with the Nazis, the idea of a master race had really been discredited. But the Supreme Court, in striking down the Oklahoma law, did it very narrowly. And the justice who wrote the decision later said they didn't want to overturn Buck v. Bell . And incredibly, in 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Missouri, which is one step below the U.S. Supreme Court, cited Buck v. Bell in a case involving sterilization of a mildly mentally retarded woman. It is still the law of the land today.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The parallels today?\n\nADAM COHEN : The parallels are very strong, right? So, first of all, there is some subterranean eugenic sterilization going on right now. We hear about cases in prisons where women are sterilized without their consent. There was a case in Tennessee a couple years ago where a prosecutor was fired allegedly for making eugenic sterilization part of his plea negotiations.\n\nAnd the danger is, as we know, we're in rather strange political times, as we talked about at the beginning of the show. We don't know if there's going to be another eugenics movement. We don't know if states will start to pass these laws. We don't know if Congress might pass these laws. There's a lot of fear in the land. Well, it would be nice to think that the U.S. Supreme Court would defend the victims of these laws, but right now they're on record saying it is constitutional.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We talked about immigrants. What about African Americans through the '20s and the '30s?\n\nADAM COHEN : Well, it's a strange story. So, in the 1920s, the same day that Virginia passed the eugenic sterilization law, they passed their Racial Purity Act, the exact same day. The reason they did that was that the eugenicists of that time were so racist that they actually didn't bother with eugenics for blacks. They thought the black race was beyond saving. Their whole focus was uplifting the white race. So they did two things. They built a wall of separation between the white and black races. They imposed large penalties for any kind of sexual unions between blacks and whites. And once they built that wall, they focused on uplifting the white race. So that's why they were focused on white women like Carrie Buck. But then, over the years, many blacks were sterilized. And in places like North Carolina in the '70s, it was a lot of poor black people who were sterilized.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Just before we end, explain when and why the U.S. scientific community gave up on eugenics.\n\nADAM COHEN : Yeah, so, at the beginning, they were among the biggest cheerleaders. The medical journals of the 1910s and '20s were enthusiastic about eugenics. Harvard geneticists were in favor of eugenics. Over time, though, it became discredited, I think, in part because of the rise of the Nazis. So this Eugenics Record Office, which was a scientific pro-eugenics operation, was funded by the Carnegie Institution. They lost their funding in the late '30s because of the rise of Nazism.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, Adam Cohen, it's an astounding book. The book is called Imbeciles: The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck . Adam Cohen is journalist and lawyer, previously member of The New York Times editorial board, former senior writer for Time magazine.

During the middle of the Vietnam War, Haden formed the Liberation Music Orchestra that mixed songs from the Spanish Civil War, anti-war songs and a tribute to Che Guevera. He recently re-formed the group to respond to the Bush administration and the invasion of Iraq. He titled the new album \"Not In Our Name.\" [includes rush transcript]\n\nWe speak with legendary bass player, composer and political activist, Charlie Haden. In the late 1950s he played in Ornette Coleman's groundbreaking quartet which changed the shape and sound of jazz.\n\nOver the years, Haden has won countless music awards, including two Grammys. And he has played with many other jazz greats including John Coltrane, Don Cherry and Archie Shepp.\n\nCharlie Haden has also been one of the most politically outspoken jazz musicians. During the middle of the Vietnam War, he and Carla Bley formed the Liberation Music Orchestra. The group's debut album mixed songs from the Spanish Civil War, anti-war songs and a tribute to Che Guevera. In 1971 he was jailed in Portugal for dedicating a song to the black liberation movements of Mozambique and Angola.\n\nLast year Haden re-formed the Liberation Music Orchestra to respond to the Bush administration and the invasion of Iraq. He titled the new album \"Not In Our Name.\" Charlie Haden recently joined us in our Firehouse Studio to talk about his music and politics.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Charlie Haden recently joined us in our Firehouse studio to talk about his music and politics. I asked him to talk about how he began playing music.\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : My parents were on the Grand Ole Opry. They traveled all over the country singing hillbilly music. That's what they called it back then. They were friends with Roy Acuff and the Delmore Brothers and the Carter Family. And all of my brothers and sisters who were older than me started on the show, after they were big enough to hold a guitar and sing.\n\nAnd I was born in Shenandoah, Iowa. I was being rocked to sleep by my mother, humming folksongs to me, and all of a sudden I started humming the harmony. I was 22 months old. And she said, \"Charlie, when you started humming the harmony with me, I knew you were ready for the show.\" And so I started on the show at 22 months old as Cowboy Charlie, and I sang every day. On the radio we had two shows a week, in the morning and in the afternoon. And I did that up until the time I was fifteen years old.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : From when you were before two years old -\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : - to 15.\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : Right. And I yodeled and I sang, and you know. And we all sang harmony.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : How many of you were there?\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : Well, there was -- I had two older brothers and an older sister that were on the main show. And later, I had a younger brother and a younger sister, but --\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Did this bring together family or divide you?\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : What was that?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Singing, playing music.\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : Oh, that brought us together. That was one of the most wonderful things about bringing our family together. We all got together every morning to decide what the songs were that we were going to sing for the radio show. Just like you prepare your show, that's the way we prepared our show. And my dad would pick out the songs that we're going to sing. And sometimes we had a radio studio in whatever house we were in, and he would crank the crank that would go into the radio stations, and that would let them know we were ready to go on the air. And sometimes we would go into the studio in Springfield, Missouri at KWTO - Keep Watching the Ozarks - and we would do the show from the studio. My dad was the MC. He gave all the commercials - you know, Wait's Green Mountain cough syrup, Sparkalite cereal, Allstate Insurance. I mean, we had all kinds of sponsors. We got mailbags from all over the country. And it was really a great experience for me, not only musically, but being close to my family and devoted to this music. And my life was filled with music, and I learned so much about harmony and melody doing those shows.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You were singing then, but you don't sing now.\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : Well, I don't sing now, because I had polio when I was 15, bulbar polio. This was when the epidemic was happening. And I was lucky that it didn't affect my lungs or my legs. It went to my face and kind of paralyzed my vocal chords, and I wasn't able to sing. And they said I was very lucky that I would get over it, which I did. But at the same time my dad had decided to retire from entertainment and start a fishing lodge down in Lake Bull Shoals in the Ozarks. He was a fisherman, so he built this fishing lodge.\n\nAnd, you know, in the meantime I had been listening to a lot of - this was before TV. Radio was the big deal. Everyone listened to the radio. I never went away from the radio. I listened to classical music. I listened to jazz. I listened to everything. And I started becoming interested in the sounds of jazz. And I went to a concert of Jazz at the Philharmonic when we lived in Omaha, Nebraska, and I saw Charlie Parker play and Billie Holiday sing and Lester Young play, and that did it. I said, \"That's what I want to do.\" And I started working toward that goal and turned down a scholarship to Oberlin Conservatory in Ohio and decided to go to Los Angeles and attend a school there. It was called Westlake College of Modern Music. This was 1956, and they supposedly had jazz there. That's why I wanted to go. But why I really wanted to go to LA was to find my favorite pianist. His name was Hampton Hawes, and he lived in LA.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Did you find him?\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : I found him. I was doing my homework one night - early one morning at 3:00 in the morning at Tiny Naylor's on La Brea and Sunset Boulevard with carhops and everything, and a guy walked in that I knew to be Red Mitchell, who was the bass player with Hampton Hawes. So I got to know him. I went up to him, and he said, \"Come over to my house, and let's hang out.\" And I went over to his house. And one day he called me, and he said, \"I'm working this gig with Art Pepper, and could you come and sit in, because I got a recording session. I can't finish the gig, and I know he'll hire you if he hears you.\" So that's what I did. Sonny Clark, legendary pianist, was playing that night. Art hired me. I came the next night, and Hampton Hawes was playing piano. And that was like a thrill.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You've had a long relationship with Ornette Coleman right up until today, the time of this interview. You've just spent two evenings with him.\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Talk about how you met and the kind of work, the music that you've played together.\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : I heard Ornette play the first time at a club called the Hague. I was on a night off. I was playing at the Hillcrest with Paul Bley, and Carla Bley was his wife. That's how I met Carla. And I went to the Hague. Gerry Mulligan was playing there with his band, and this guy comes up to the stage and asks to sit in. They tell him to come up, and he got his alto. It was a plastic - white plastic alto saxophone. And he starts to play, and the whole room lit up for me. It was so brilliant. And as soon as he started to play, they asked him to stop. So he put the horn back in the case and started out the back door.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Why did they ask him to stop?\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : Well, you know, Ornette's music was completely different than traditional jazz. It was free improvisation. It was his way of improvising. It was improvising and creating a new chord structure to the song that you were playing. That's the way he played, and a lot of musicians didn't feel close to that, and it was new to them. And so, they asked him to stop playing. And so, I missed him. He would disappear into the night.\n\nI found out the next night at the Hillcrest from my drummer, from Paul Bley's drummer, Lennie McBrowne. I said, \"I heard this guy play, who was brilliant, and played like the human voice.\" And he said, \"Was he playing a plastic horn?\" And I said, \"Yeah.\" He said, \"That was Ornette Coleman. I'll introduce you to him.\" He brought him in.\n\nWe met, and I told him how great he played. And he said, \"Thank you.\" He said, \"Not many people tell me that.\" I mean, he said, \"Let's go play.\" And we went over to his house, and we played for three days. And then we started rehearsing with Don Cherry and Billy Higgins. And then a guy from Atlantic Records came to one of the rehearsals, Nesuhi Ertegun, and wanted us to make a record. And we made two albums: The Shape of Jazz to Come and Tomorrow Is the Question! and Change of the Century .\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So all these very future-looking - The Shape of Jazz to Come .\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : And Change of the Century .\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What did you mean - The Shape of Jazz to Come ?\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : Well, that was Ornette's title, and he always had this - you know, this vision. He's a real visionary in his music. And he has these great titles to his songs and to his albums. And so, The Shape of Jazz to Come , that's what it was. There were several revolutions, changes in the world of jazz, you know. Louis Armstrong and some other people started it out. And then there was the swing era with the big bands. And then Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie came along and created bebop on 52nd Street in the '40s. That was a revolution in the language of jazz. And then, when Ornette and Don and I and Billy came to New York, that was the next one.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You have four records/CDs out with the Liberation Music Orchestra. Can you talk about the first one, how it all began, how you established this orchestra, why its name?\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : I established it from my concerns about what was going on in the world because of the Nixon administration and the war in Vietnam, and I started thinking about, \"I've gotta do something about this.\" And I had some music from the Spanish Civil War that was in my collection, and I started thinking about - maybe I can do - I mean, I had never done this before, you know? And maybe I could do something where I can play some political songs from the Spanish Civil War. I can write a song about my hero Che Guevara and call it \"Song for Che.\" I can write a piece about the Chicago Democratic Convention in Chicago in 1968, where people were, you know, beaten on the street and jailed.\n\nAnd so, I called up a colleague of mine, Carla Bley, who I had known since 1957 and who's a great arranger and great composer, and I said, \"I want to do this, and will you write arrangements?\" And she said, \"Let's go over the music.\" And we got together. I played her all the music. She wrote some pieces. I wrote some pieces. And we wanted to voice it like the old recordings from the Spanish Republican Band. They had like this brass band, where they did all these songs, and it had French horn, tuba, trumpets, saxophones. So that's what we did. And I got all of my guys that I played jazz with, you know, for many years - Don Cherry, Dewey Redman, Paul Motian, a great - Roswell Rudd - and we asked them if they wanted to do this, and they said yes. And so, you know, Carla wrote the arrangements.\n\nWe had a little rehearsal at -- first of all, I had to find a record company, because every company I went to with this idea said no, because of the politics. And I finally found a guy. His name was Bob Thiele, and he had been producing a lot of John Coltrane on Impulse. He worked for Impulse, which was ABC . And I went up to his office, and I said, \"This is what I want to do.\" And he said, \"Well, it's a great, you know, project.\" He said, \"Let's do it. I don't know if it'll be released, but let's do it.\" And so, he rented Judson Hall on 57th Street in New York, and I knew some Abraham Lincoln vets that had fought in Spain --\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And you write in the record, the album I have here - thanks to our producer, Mike Burke, who is a real connoisseur of all you've done - you write about the Spanish Civil War, and you talk about how approximately 1,600 of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade came back alive. You invited survivors to you concert?\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : That lived in the New York area. And I called one of the men that I knew, and he got in touch with everybody else, and they brought their wives. And it was a very mind-opening experience for me to read about the Spanish Civil War, because, you know, Chamberlain and Roosevelt remained neutral when Franco was the dictator in Spain and there was a revolution, and they didn't help the Spanish Republic to fight Franco. And so, as a result, people from all over the world, countries from all over the world volunteered to come help the Spanish Republic fight fascism. And they lost. And if they hadn't lost, fascism would have been defeated, and there probably wouldn't have been a World War II. You know, Hitler had the opportunity to try out all of his new weapons during the Spanish Civil War.\n\nAnd the thing that really moved me, too, was the music that came out of that. You know, when you have people fighting to survive a life struggle, you know, you hear music from those people that's very deep and very moving. And in this case, they were all Spanish folksongs, that new words were added to them for the wartime.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So this record was released, your first.\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : After I went to Los Angeles - I lived in New York then, and I flew to LA - and I presented one of the executives with some information that was kind of misleading, but he didn't know it. And I said, you know - they were worried about the word \"liberation,\" because of the Liberation Front in Vietnam and all the things that were associated with that, you know, at the time. And I said, \"You know, this is a very hip word, 'liberation.' That's what the United States is built on, you know.\" And I said, \"And if you don't let me release this record, a rock group is going to steal this title.\" He said, \"Oh, God! I never thought of that. Okay!\" So, it was that easy. You know, it was plane fare all the way to LA. And then I had got them to release the album. After it was released, there was a lot of controversy about it, and a lot of the jazz critics, the conservative jazz critics, put it down. And it was kind of lost in the shuffle. But it became a cult kind of classic.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about playing in Portugal? When was that? '71?\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : It was 1971. I had just had triplet daughters. And -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Their names?\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : Rachel, Petra and Tanya.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : They're all musicians?\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : They're all musicians now. And my son Josh was three years old. And -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Aren't you going to be recording - going back to country music and playing with all of them?\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : I'm going down to Nashville and doing a country record, back to, you know, where I came from. And they're all going to come with me.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : With the triplets and your son?\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : And my wife Ruth is coming.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Who's a great singer.\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : Who's a great singer and producer. She produces everything I do, with me. And there's a lot of people in Nashville that know about my family that really want to be a part of this. And it's going to be great. I've been wanting to do this for so long.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So Petra, she's with the Foo Fighters.\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : She's with the Foo Fighters. And Rachel is with a band called the Rentals. She's on tour now. And the three of them sing together better than the Dixie Chicks. You know, they're great. But Tanya right now is taking care of my brand new grandson, but they still sing, and they're really looking forward to going to Nashville.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And Tanya's married to Jack Black. They went to high school together?\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : That's right. And they have a new baby, Sam Haden Black. And Ruth and I are going to see them in just a minute.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I don't want to keep you, but I also do want to keep you. And your son is with Spain?\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : My son had a band called Spain, which made four recordings and was really critically acclaimed all over the world. When he goes - even here, his concerts are sold out. And now, then, he just did a solo record. And, you know, the record business, because of downloading, etc., is really at a low right now, and it's really hard for artists to get their music out. And so, now he's going to put it out himself. And it's really, really beautiful.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, now I want to go back to you. 1971, had you had your kids yet?\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : Yes. They were born October 11, and Ornette called and said we have a chance to go on this Newport Jazz Festival tour of Europe with Duke Ellington's band; Miles Davis's band; Dexter Gordon; the Giants of Jazz, which included Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Stitt, Al McKibben, Art Blakey. I mean, I can't believe that we were all on tour together. And I was with Ornette's quartet, which was Ornette, and Dewey Redman was playing tenor saxophone, and Ed Blackwell was playing drums. And I said, \"Well, you know, we just had these girls, man. And I gotta stay here and help, you know.\" And -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Not just girls. Triplets.\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : Triplets, yeah. But anyway -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Did you know you were having triplets?\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : We did, yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : From early on?\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : My ex-wife, their mother, we - back then, they didn't have ultrasound. And there was an x-ray, which we were very concerned about, but they saw three, and they said, \"You've got three.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : How late into the pregnancy?\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : This was eight months.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Eight months into the pregnancy, you learned you were having triplets?\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so, Ornette said, \"Well, can her mother come out and help, because this tour is really important, you know?\" And I said, \"Okay.\" So we got it all fixed up, and I went to Europe. But I saw on the itinerary before we left that we were playing in Portugal, and I didn't agree with the government there. It was a kind of a fascist government. They had colonies in Guinea-Bissau, in Angola and Mozambique, and they were systematically wiping out the Black race, you know? And so I called Ornette, and I said, \"You know, I don't want to play in Portugal.\" And he said, \"Charlie, we've already signed the contract. We've gotta play. It's the last country on the concert tour. Figure out - maybe you can do something to protest it, you know?\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The Caetano regime.\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : Yeah. And so, during the tour we were playing one of my songs, \"Song for Che,\" and I decided that when we played my song, because it was connected to me, because I was the guy that was going to do it, you know, I would dedicate that song to the Black peoples' liberation movements in Mozambique and Angola and Guinea-Bissau. And I asked - I think we were in Bulgaria, and we were doing a jazz festival there. Or Romania, we were in Bucharest, and I asked one of the journalists there, who was from Portugal, I said, \"I'm planning on\" - because he knew about the Liberation Music Orchestra. He says, \"What are you going to do?\" And I said, \"I'm going to dedicate - what would happen if I did this?\"\n\nHe said, \"Well, three or four different things. You can either be shot on the spot, or they could pull you off the stage, or they could arrest you on the stage. They could arrest you in your dressing room. Or they can arrest you later. But you're going to be arrested.\" And I thought, you know, I don't think they'll arrest me, man. I'm an American jazz musician. This is a jazz festival. It has nothing to do with politics. I think I'm safe.\n\nSo I made the dedication, and I wasn't arrested immediately, but, you know, when I did the dedication there were young people there, students, that were in the cheaper seats in front, and they all started cheering so loud that you couldn't hear the music. And a lot of police were running around with automatic weapons, and they, right after we finished our set, they stopped down the festival, and they closed down in Cascais this big stadium that we were playing in. And we went back to the hotel, and so I was starting to get concerned about what was going to happen.\n\nThe next day, we went to the airport, and at the airport, I was trying to get my bass on the plane to make sure I could get the bass on the plane. And there were hundreds and hundreds of people in front of the airlines' counters. And finally, one of the people from TWA came around the counter and said, \"There was a man over there who wanted to interview you, and you have to stay here.\" And I said, \"I don't want to be interviewed.\" And Ornette came over and said, \"What's going on?\" And they say, \"They want to interview Mr. Haden, and you guys are going to get on the plane. And he's staying here.\" And Ornette said, \"No, we're not going on the plane. We're going to stay here with him.\" And they said, \"No, you're not. You're getting on the plane.\" They took them by the arms, and they led them on the aircraft. And I stayed there, and they took me down a winding staircase to an interrogation room and started pumping me with questions. They said, \"We're going to transfer you over to the PIDE headquarters.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The police?\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : It was the political police of Portugal. And so I said, you know, \"I'm a United States citizen with a United States passport. I demand to be able to call the embassy.\" And the guy who worked for TWA looked at me and smiled and said, \"It's Sunday, Mr. Haden. You can't call the embassy. You shouldn't mix politics with music.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Jazz legend Charlie Haden. We'll be back with him in a minute.\n\n[break]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : \"Song for Che\" by Charlie Haden, the song he dedicated to the Black liberation movements of Mozambique and Angola that got him arrested in Portugal in 1971. Charlie Haden describes what happened once the Portuguese police got him.\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : And the next thing I know, I'm in a car, and we're traveling to a prison. And I'm thrown into a dark room with no lights, and I stay there for I don't know how long. A long, long time. And finally - I mean, I was traumatized. You know, I thought I'd never get to see my kids. I thought it was over. I didn't know what they were going to do.\n\nAnd they finally came and got me from the room and took me up to an interrogation room with really, really bright lights. I couldn't see anything. And there was one guy who spoke English that started pumping questions at me right and left, and one of the questions, which I was kind of prepared for, because I thought I would kind of try to fool them. He said, \"Why did you make this dedication?\" And I said, \"Well, I've been making a dedication at every country we went to. I dedicated something in Germany to the German people. I dedicated something in France.\" And he said, \"Do you expect us to believe that?\" You know, anyway, they brought a statement to me to sign. I refused to sign it, and they started to look -- one guy had a trunch, and in his hand he was doing like this. And --\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Hitting it against his other hand.\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : Hitting it against his other hand. And as soon as I thought like everything is over with, there was a guy that came down and whispered something in the head policeman's ear. And all of a sudden he completely changed. He says, \"Mr. Haden, you're going upstairs. Someone from the American embassy is here to retrieve you.\"\n\nAnd I went up to this real plush room, which was really different from where I had been, and the guy said, \"Hey, Charlie, what'd you say the other night that caused all that commotion?\" He says, \"Wow!\" He said, \"Well, my name's Bob Jones, and I'm from Chicago. I'm the cultural attaché here. Come along with me and, you know, we can get you out of this place.\" You know, I said, \"Oh, great!\" Anyway, I went to his villa and went to the airport and got -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This was Nixon's cultural attaché to Portugal.\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : This was Nixon's cultural attaché. I found out later from Ornette, too, and from other people that they weren't going to do - the United States wasn't going to do anything, because they were very embarrassed by what I did, because of NATO . And they didn't want to have anything to do with it. And finally, I guess Ornette helped, too, and one of the promoters in Lisbon was kind enough to help, and they said, \"You know, this guy's a famous jazz musician, and you better let him go, you know, because it's not going to look good for you.\" And they let me go, and I was very happy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're talking to the legendary musician, bassist and political activist, Charlie Haden. After this, did it change your thoughts about speaking out? Did it make you radioactive for other jazz musicians? Did musicians support you in what you had done?\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : Most of the musicians that I performed and played and recorded with all supported me. You know, it's such a struggle for jazz musicians in this country to get their music played and to the people. And in that struggle, they don't really have time - or, you know, they're struggling to play their music, and I think that that's the reason that more musicians don't speak out politically.\n\nBut I started getting worried when the FBI came to my apartment, and they had been watching the house. I saw cars out in front on 97th Street, where we lived, and I knew plain-clothes cars when I saw it, you know. And they finally came up to the door and rang the doorbell, and they said, \"We're FBI . We want to talk to you.\" And I said, \"Well, why should I let you in?\" They said, \"Well, we're asking you if we can come in and talk to you.\" So I said, \"I don't have anything to hide. Come in.\" So, they asked me, you know, \"Why did you do that?\" And I told them. I said, \"I don't agree with the policies of the Portuguese government, and that's why I did that.\" And they had a whole dossier on me. I couldn't believe it.\n\nAnyway, but I thought about it afterwards, and if I had it to do again, I would do it again. And as a result, I think, of what I did, because nobody had ever done that in Portugal, my wife Ruth and I later learned that they put it into the school books of the schools in Portugal, what I did. And there was a revolution in 1974 of the young enlisted officers, and they overthrew Caetano. He fled the country. And I think it was a gentleman named Duarte [Soares] that took over, socialist government. They invited me to come back, and I came back and I played. And there were 40,000 people in this big meadow in Lisbon, and they were all chanting, \"Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!\" And I had goose bumps all over. It made me feel so good.\n\nAnd then, my wife Ruth and I were invited back, because I met, while I was there, Carlos Paredes, who was this famous fado player, and I loved his playing, and so I said, \"I want to play with you.\" He had been arrested under Salazar. And we came back and did a film with him, and they took me back to the stadium where I was arrested in '71. And they did a little documentary. It was all in Portuguese. And it was really nice to go back.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to talk about speaking out and how easy or hard it is, and if you think that as a white jazz musician, you were able to speak out more than Black jazz musicians, if it matters. I mean, Louis Armstrong, for example, not known for speaking out, but when it came to the Little Rock Nine, to the kids not being able to get in school, he did speak out fiercely and actually talked about President Eisenhower - why wasn't he taking the hand of the children and walking into school? - and took great risk in speaking out. Do you think there's a difference?\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : No, I don't think there's a difference. I think it's a commitment to equality and to humanism and compassion in the world. It's a commitment. I mean, when you're a sensitive human being and you see the things that are going on around you that aren't human, you know, you have to speak out and do something about it. And I think that's what Louis Armstrong did. And, you know, Max Roach and Charlie Mingus did the same thing when they made the recordings they made about racism. And Archie Shepp. There's a lot of African American musicians that spoke out about racism, and I'm happy about that.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You've won a lot of awards, Charlie Haden. You won the Downbeat critics and readers polls for unprecedented 14 consecutive years as number one acoustic bassist. You've won Grammy after Grammy. But your latest CD, your latest Liberation Music Orchestra CD, called Not in My Name [sic] didn't win a Grammy.\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : Not in Our Name .\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Not in Our Name .\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : And, you know, I was on tour with Pat Metheny in 2003, and we did an album called Beyond the Missouri Sky . It was a duet. We're both from Missouri. And it was all these beautiful Americana songs and really well received. And so we were doing a tour for this music, and we were in Italy and in Spain, especially. We were walking down streets in different cities, and we would see unfurled from balconies of the apartment houses, \"Not In Our Name.\" And that's when Iraq had been attacked. People talk about a war in Iraq. There's no war in Iraq. It was an invasion and an occupation. And the people in Europe really cared, you know. And when I saw all these banners from the balconies saying, \"Not In Our Name,\" that stuck with me. And when I did this record, that's what I called it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Not in Our Name .\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And in Not in Our Name , you have this medley of songs you call \"America the Beautiful.\"\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : There were so many songs that we wanted to do. And Carla composed a song. I composed a song. And the medley was \"America the Beautiful\" combined with \"Lift Every Voice and Sing,\" which is the African American national anthem in the United States, very famous song and beautiful song. And then we did Ornette Coleman's \"Skies of America.\" And we did - you know, there was another guy, Gary McFarland, who was a jazz composer/arranger back in the late '60s, who made an album called America the Beautiful . He was one of the guys that spoke out, you know. And we patterned one of the arrangements after his arrangement. And we did \"Adagio for Strings.\" I wanted to do all American composers. \"This Is Not America\" by Pat Metheny, which was in the movie, The Falcon and the Snowman , and David Bowie sings it at the end. And then we did Carla's song, \"Blue Anthem,\" my song, \"Not in Our Name.\" We did \"Amazing Grace,\" which I used to sing, you know, in church. And we did \"Goin' Home,\" which has become kind of like a folksong in the United States, which was actually from the \"Largo\" from the New World Symphony by Dvorak. And \"Adagio for Strings\" by Samuel Barber.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Do you think the title being Not in Our Name had an effect on its reception, in terms of the conventional, you know, awards?\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : Well, you know, I really don't have time to even dwell on those things. I know that a lot of those things happen, and I have so much to do that I don't really think about that. I know that it probably wasn't nominated for a Grammy because of its politics. But, you know, who am I to say? You know, I make the music, and what happens after I make the music, I hope, is a positive thing for people and causes them to start thinking about, this shouldn't be in our name either. But I've had, you know, many people come up to me and say, \"It's really great that you did this,\" and \"Thank you for doing this.\" And that's rewarding to me.\n\nWe were just in South Africa playing at the Cape Town Festival, and I was there with my wife Ruth and Quartet West. And there was a gentleman there that was in the parliament, and he came up to me. He says, \"Can I have coffee with you?\" And so we went and had coffee, and he said, \"You know, you politicized me when I was a young man. I listened to your first Liberation Orchestra recording, and I started reading about Che Guevara, and I started reading about the Spanish Civil War. I started reading about all these different things.\" And he said, \"And I was living in a one-room shack with my family. Eleven kids, no running water, whatever, back in apartheid,\" you know. And he said, \"Then I joined the ANC , and I was arrested, put in solitary confinement, and I thought about your music. It kept me going. And when I was released and Nelson Mandela freed me\" - and he said, \"I play your music all the time.\" He said, \"It's because of you that I was politicized.\"\n\nHe said, \"I had to come and thank you for this, because you're here in Cape Town.\" And he said, \"I wanted you to know what you did for my life.\" And he said, \"I want you\" - to Ruth and I, he said, \"I want you and your wife to meet my wife and my sons.\" And it was so great, you know, and tears came to our eyes when he was talking about his confinement and what he had to go through. And he says, \"Now I go to parliament every day, and I listen to your record with Hank Jones called Steal Away every morning at five.\" And that just knocked me out. So it's things like that that make everything worthwhile, all the sacrifices, all of the, whatever, criticism. But, you know, there's more enjoyment and there's more fulfillment than there is criticism, and that's what I'm happy about.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Finally, Charlie, 50 years of making music and many years to come, is there anything you wish you had done, and do you plan to do it now?\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : I've been so lucky to play with great musicians, most of whom I wanted to play with and I sought out when I was in my younger stages, and, you know, I wouldn't do anything different, except I would seek out as many musicians to life the way I am and dedicated to beauty the way I am, because it's not really about categories, like jazz, it's about beautiful music and playing music from all over the world with other musicians who are dedicated, because it's up to us to bring beauty back into this world. It's up to people in the arts, the painters, the writers, the composers, the dance troupes, everybody, the actors, the people who write poetry. You know, it's up to us to try to make a difference in this world and try to make this planet a better to live for all the human beings and stop the cruelty and the devastation that's going on, you know, and have a great place.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Do you think you can do that with your music?\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : I'm going to try.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And do you think jazz is going to continue?\n\nCHARLIE HADEN : Jazz will always continue. It's an art form that's very, very powerful, very, very powerful, and has a powerful message of improvisation and spontaneity. And there's a lot of young people dedicated to it, and they're being born every day, you know. And it's not just in jazz. It's in all different kinds of music that young people want to express themselves in the language of whatever art form they're in. And that's the most important thing. I started the Jazz Studies out at California Institute of the Arts in 1982, and that's a campus that has all of the arts, you know, and I tell my students - I mean, there's young people from all over the world that come to study with me about the spirituality of improvisation.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Jazz legend Charlie Haden.

Many questions center on a woman identified in the grand jury documents simply as \"Witness 40.\" She told the grand jury that Brown charged at Wilson \"like a football player.\" Earlier this week, the website TheSmokingGun.com identified Witness 40 as Sandra McElroy. The website described her as a \"bipolar Missouri woman with a criminal past who has a history of making racist remarks and once insinuated herself into another high-profile St. Louis criminal case with claims that police eventually dismissed as a 'complete fabrication.'\" It now appears McElroy may have lied about witnessing the shooting, which occurred 30 miles from her home. On Tuesday, Rev. Al Sharpton said the report about Witness 40 gave new hope to the Brown family. He told the New York Daily News it shows the grand jury was \"not a fair process.\" We speak about the case with TheSmokingGun.com editor William Bastone. He is the lead author of the article exposing the identity of Witness 40.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: As protests continue across the country over the police killing of Michael Brown, new questions are being raised about the grand jury that failed to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson for shooting Brown. Many questions center on a woman identified in the grand jury documents simply as \"Witness 40.\" She told the grand jury that Brown charged at Wilson, quote, \"like a football player.\" Her testimony largely supported Wilson's versions of events and has been cited repeatedly on Fox News.\n\nSEAN HANNITY : And then, quote, \"He looked like a football player with his head down charging at Officer Wilson,\" charged at him, quote-and I'm reading-\"like a football player with his head down charging.\" ... That Michael Brown, you know, was charging like a football player, full force, on Officer Wilson. ... One witness described it as charging at Officer Wilson like a football player with his head down. ... Don't charge him, to quote one of the eyewitnesses, like a football player with your head down.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Earlier this week, \"The Smoking Gun\" website identified Witness 40 as Sandra McElroy. The website described her as a, quote, \"bipolar Missouri woman with a criminal past who has a history of making racist remarks and once insinuated herself into another high-profile St. Louis criminal case with claims that police eventually dismissed as a 'complete fabrication.'\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : It now appears that Sandra McElroy may have lied about witnessing the shooting, which occurred 30 miles from her home. She gave conflicting accounts to prosecutors about why she was near the Canfield Green Apartments in Ferguson at the shooting. She first said she wanted to \"pop in\" on a friend she hadn't seen in 26 years. Later she read from a notebook in which she claimed to have been visiting the neighborhood to conduct personal research to help her understand black people.\n\nIt has also come to light that she had a history of posting racist comments online and helped raise money for Wilson and other Ferguson police officers. On Tuesday, the Reverend Al Sharpton said the report about Witness 40 gave new hope to the Brown family. He told the New York Daily News it shows the grand jury was, quote, \"not a fair process.\"\n\nJoining us now is William Bastone, editor of \"The Smoking Gun.\" He co-authored the piece exposing the identity of Witness 40.\n\nTell us more about her. And how did you find out who she was?\n\nWILLIAM BASTONE : Well, what we did is we looked at two volumes of her grand jury testimony, which is heavily redacted, but we zeroed in on the portions that gave a little bit of biographical detail about her-excuse me. And we used that information-you know, everything from the fact that she was adopted, divorced, had a couple of felony convictions and some other stuff-and then we basically went online and looked at some-a Facebook page that we believed she was associated with. And I'll spare you all the details, but by a process of elimination, we zeroed in on her, figured out-got her name, and then we went and checked on Sandra McElroy's background, and it basically dovetailed exactly with Witness 40-everything.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Now, in her testimony, she had admitted that she had been convicted of-\n\nWILLIAM BASTONE : Check fraud.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: -check fraud, right?\n\nWILLIAM BASTONE : Two felony counts of check fraud in 2007, had received three years of probation, a suspended sentence. And so, you know, then we reached out to a couple other people who had had interactions with her, and it made us convinced it was the same woman.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, how was she presented to the grand jury? What did the police know? What did the district attorney know? And explain exactly what she said.\n\nWILLIAM BASTONE : Well, she initially-she was not found by law enforcement. She approached law enforcement more than a month after the incident. She approached the St. Louis County police, gave an account of what occurred. Five weeks later, she met with the FBI and two Justice Department prosecutors, and then a day after that, they put her in the grand jury for the first time. So, she comes up with this story, that she sat on for a month, and tells the cops this story, and then five weeks pass before she basically goes into the grand jury.\n\nAnd the thing that is incredibly puzzling is that I don't think that anyone attempted to determine whether what she told them was true or not, because as we point out-I don't know if we point out in the story, but our interest in investigating her began and our-found out who she was and everything about her, it took us two days to do that. We don't have subpoena power. We can't get her phone records. It took us, two reporters, three days to find her. And the cops had five weeks to find out. First, the story, on its face, was wholly unbelievable. And there were just simple investigative tasks that the cops could have done that could have disproven her. So, what they did, who knows what they did? But what the effect is, is, as I think we point out in our story, is that they basically allowed her story now to get baked into the narrative of the grand jury.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, interestingly, her claim-her initial claim, because she changed the story, right? Her initial claim was, because she was a white woman in a largely black neighborhood, that when she was asked why she was there, was that she was trying to find a former high school friend that she hadn't seen in over 20 years, and got lost, couldn't find the address and got out of her car to ask for instructions. So-\n\nWILLIAM BASTONE : And then, amazingly, this cataclysmic event happens right in front of her. What luck!\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: So, you would think the police would at least say, \"Well, let's see in the surveillance footage if-or the video footage, if her car is anywhere in the vicinity.\"\n\nWILLIAM BASTONE : Right. Well, they actually eventually did that. When she was-when she was questioned by the FBI and the two Justice Department prosecutors, they basically said to her, \"You know that there are surveillance cameras in the area, and no one picked your car up. How could that be?\" And she had no explanation. And they asked her, \"Well, how did you get there?\" And she described her path of getting there. And then they said, \"Well, after it occurred, how did you leave?\" And she gave an explanation that was impossible based on the way the roads were. There was-it was very clear that she looked at a map of the area, and she-looking at a map, or if you go online, MapQuest or Google Maps, it appears as if there is a pathway out of the area, and that's the way she took. But that thing has been closed for like two or three years, and if you had physically been there, you would have known there was only one way out.\n\nSo, the story fell apart. And they kind of picked the story apart. But, you know, what you don't really know is there are 12 grand jurors in there, and you don't really know if anyone bought part of her story or that figured into their final decision, which is really kind of the scary part of it. It's like-it's like a person comes up with an insane story, approaches the cops with it, and usually the way it works is, like, \"OK, thank you for coming in. We'll be in contact with you,\" and then they're never heard from again.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, your article notes that Sandra McElroy appeared at the Ferguson grand jury November 3rd with a spiral notebook purportedly containing her handwritten journal entries from August. The opening entry in her journal on the day Brown died declared, quote, \"Well Im gonna take my random drive to Florisant. Need to understand the Black race better so I stop calling Blacks Niggers and Start calling them People.\" That was her quote. I never use that word, except this is so significant right now because she used that word. What did Bob McCulloch understand about who she was?\n\nWILLIAM BASTONE : Well, yes, it was at the end-it was in the waning moments of her first appearance in the grand jury, on October 23rd. I mean, she was virtually out the door, when she says, as a matter of fact, \"Oh, you know, I wrote all this stuff down in my journal after it happened.\" And they were-\"Would you like to see it?\" And they were like, \"Sure,\" you know, and that meant she was coming back.\n\nSo, 10 days passes, and she appears with this one volume that is her-it's a notebook, her August notebook, and everything that precedes August 9th are like one-line entries. You know, I wrote in the piece, you know, they probably should have checked to see if the ink was wet on the notebook, because there's no doubt what she did is-it was created after the fact to buttress this harebrained story that she told.\n\nAnd, you know, it just seems like if-you know, we point out in the story, like, we went back and looked-you know, we knew what her Facebook handles were, and we knew what her YouTube account was and her Twitter account was. And she-you know, after the shooting, even after her grand jury testimony, she was saying these incendiary things online. And it just-\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, that's the other-could you talk about that, what you found out from her social media accounts in terms of her biases and also her support of Darren Wilson and police officers, in general?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And if you talked to her?\n\nWILLIAM BASTONE : Yeah, I'll tell-yeah, I'll explain that, as well. Yeah, we looked. You know, she is a very active commenter on Mike Brown. And she has a couple of Facebook accounts that we've linked to her, and she's acknowledged after the fact they're hers. And she was constantly commenting about the case, supportive of Officer Wilson. And she would do things like she would-most of what she would do is she would be in the comment sections on television stations or print publications. You know, there's a story, and then there's the comments underneath, and she'd hop in there. And she'd do things like, one afternoon, commenting on some news story about Ferguson, she just posts a graphic, that floats around in these kind of right-wing circles, and it's a photograph of Michael Brown lying dead in the street, and it's captioned something along the lines of \"Stop asking for justice for Michael Brown. He got his justice,\" you know, and it's a photo of him dead in the street. And she constantly was doing stuff like that, and \"Pray for Officer Wilson.\"\n\nAnd, you know, when she was in the grand jury, she basically denied that she was like a stooge for Officer Wilson-she was just there to tell the truth. You know, and she was involved in a Facebook page that she started 10 days after the shooting that purportedly was there to support law enforcement officers and first responders in Ferguson, and had nothing to do with Officer Wilson. They were raising money in a kind of a crowd-sourced fashion. And in the end, they donated all the money to the Officer Wilson trust fund. So, you know, I mean, this was all easily obtainable.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Could she be charged with perjury?\n\nWILLIAM BASTONE : Well, she should be charged with perjury. She lied to the cops. That's making false statements. The first time, September 11th, when they-when she sat down and she spoke with the FBI and the Department of Justice, she lied to them. The first time they put her in the state grand jury, she lied. The second time, she admitted she lied the first time and then lied again. So, she's got-yeah, she should.\n\nYou know, and it's one of these things where, yes, she has said that she suffers-she's been diagnosed as being bipolar and that she has bouts of mania. But, you know, you-she insinuated herself into a case of national importance and spun out a story that was totally untrue. And do you walk away from that without some sort of-you know, the government just saying, \"Oh, that's fine. Next time something like this happens, if you're a lunatic and you want to come forward and create a story that's going to back up the cops, come on in. We're happy to have you\"?\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: But the bigger-that's the bigger question, in my mind. It's not what she did, but what prosecutors did, because either-\n\nWILLIAM BASTONE : It's mystifying.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: -they were totally inept in one of-as you say, one of the biggest cases in recent times, of national attention, or they knew or suspected that she was lying and didn't care, which was even worse.\n\nWILLIAM BASTONE : Well, you know what? If you're a prosecutor and you know that someone's going to come in into a grand jury and lie, you can't really allow them to do that. That's called creating a perjury trap.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can a new grand jury be convened, based on this?\n\nWILLIAM BASTONE : I don't know. I mean, I think that's probably a fairly tough thing to do.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And you spoke to her?\n\nWILLIAM BASTONE : Yes. I mean, she would not talk to us before the story came out. We published the story on Monday morning. Yesterday, I corresponded with her, in which she admitted that, yes, in fact, she was Witness 40, and she expressed concerns for the safety of her three minor children, and she's trying to erase her social media presence. And then I had a-she wanted to have a conversation off the record, which we had a lengthy conversation off the record. And hopefully we'll maybe try to see if she'll want to move some of that on the record.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, and, of course, Witness 40 was-the importance of her testimony was that she, and there's at least another witness, as I recall, Witness 10, who were the ones who said that Brown charged at police officer Wilson. And so, obviously, if her testimony is impugned, then the issue becomes: What about this other witness? And I want to turn to MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell. Late last month, he dissected the credibility of that other witness, Witness 10.\n\nLAWRENCE O'DONNELL: Witness number 10 was working in the neighborhood, and he begins his story to the police with: \"I seen the two young guys walkin' down the street on the same sidewalk that I was on.\" Six weeks later, witness number 10 testified to the grand jury and changed his story about where Michael Brown was walking. He said under oath to the grand jury, \"I seen Mike Brown and his friend walking down the street closer to the curb, not on the sidewalk.\" That is the kind of thing the district attorney was complaining about last night-witnesses changing their stories to fit the publicly known facts.\n\nHere is why witness number 10 was the most important witness to appear in Darren Wilson's defense. This is what he described Michael Brown doing when Officer Wilson got out of the car and chased him: \"[Michael Brown] stopped. He did turn. He did some sort of body gesture. I'm not sure what it was, but I know it was a body gesture. And I could say for sure he never put his hands up after he did his body gesture. He ran towards the officer full charge.\" So there's witness number 10 saying the magic words: He never put his hands up, and he ran towards the officer full charge.\n\nIn the grand jury, when the prosecutor asked witness number 10 to describe what he called a \"body gesture,\" he said, \"I can't say for sure what sort of body gesture. I cannot fully recall. All I know is it was not in a surrendering motion of I'm surrendering, putting my hands up or anything. I'm not sure if it was like a shoulder shrug or him pulling his pants up. I'm not sure.\" So, there's the district attorney's favorite witness, the only one he quoted last night, saying, \"I cannot fully recall. ... I'm not sure. ... I'm not sure,\" within the body of an answer in which the only thing he's absolutely sure of is that Michael Brown did not do a surrendering motion. In a real courtroom, when a witness begins his answer with \"I can't say for sure,\" and then in the body of his answer he says, \"I cannot recall fully,\" and then says, \"I am not sure,\" twice within that same answer, that witness observation does not survive cross-examination. But there was no cross-examination in the grand jury room.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was Lawrence O'Donnell on his show on MSNBC , Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell . And he went on from there. His final point about [witness] number 10 is that when he was asked by the police how far away he was, he said about a hundred yards-a football field away. When he goes into the grand jury, he says something like 50 yards-he cuts it in half-or 50 to 75 yards. Can he see? Does he wear glasses? None of those questions, because this isn't a trial. This is a grand jury. Juan?\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Yeah, well, in light of this, Bill, your sense of-because obviously there's still a federal investigation going on, and this kind of a dissecting of these witnesses and the testimony, that led the grand jury to decide there was no reason to indict, will certainly catch the attention, hopefully, of the federal investigators.\n\nWILLIAM BASTONE : Yeah, I would think that-I have hopes that the investigation that they would do would be a lot more thorough than the local law enforcement agencies have proven to be capable of undertaking. I would assume that there-if someone says they were there, there's going to be a good attempt of trying to figure out, in fact, whether they were there. Did they have their cellphone? Did it ping off of a cellphone tower? You know, anything. Is their car on any of the surveillance video outside some of these buildings? I mean, the Witness 40, McElroy, you know, conveniently, when she took this 30-mile drive up there, she left her cellphone at home. You know, I mean, there's so simple ways to just go get her-go get her cellphone bills. You know, there's like a six- or seven-hour time. If she placed one-she doesn't have a landline. If she placed one phone call off of her cellphone, you'd pick it up off of-it'd ping off of a tower, and you'll know she was nowhere near Ferguson at the time. You know, and the other thing is that when she testified the first time in the grand jury, it was one day after the St. Louis Post-Dispatch published a lengthy story that detailed exactly what Darren Wilson told police about his version of events. And if you look at that story and you look at her testimony, you wouldn't be able to tell the two apart. So you get a good idea where she came up with all the facts.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, William Bastone, we thank you so much for your reporting. Of course, we'll continue to follow this. And what does this mean for a grand jury? Could there be another grand jury? What does this mean for the prosecutor, for Bob McCulloch? William Bastone is editor of \"The Smoking Gun\" and lead author of the new article , \"'Witness 40': Exposing a Fraud in Ferguson.\" We'll link to it at democracynow.org.\n\nWhen we come back, what's happened to James Risen, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist for The New York Times ? What is the Justice Department now offering him? Does he still face years in prison for refusing to reveal a source?

      "text": "What Does It Mean to Be Black?\n\nStudent, NYU\n\nWe live in a dynamic time. All of the distinctions and conventions that we once took for granted are now under frequent and aggressive questioning, one might say to the point of assault. Though I've considered the question before, the recent case of Rachel Dolezal has brought it front of mind. What does it mean to be black?\n\nThough you surely know who she is at this point, Rachel Dolezal is the former president of the Spokane, Washington chapter of the NAACP. Immense controversy has arisen concerning her racial identity. In short, Dolezal has been living as a black woman though she is white by birth. Some accuse her of appropriating black culture and heritage for professional advancement. Some say that she is living a \"straight up lie.\"\n\nThe irony of the proximity between Dolezal's story and the widely publicized transition of Caitlyn, formerly Bruce, Jenner has been noted. Jenner's transition has brought the transgender discussion, once marginalized, into mainstream American discourse. Caitlyn Jenner was met with overwhelming media support. Anyone who dared joke about her identity and transition was immediately shamed and condemned as insensitive. According to my understanding, one's identity as transgender is determined by how one feels individually about themselves. Any surgery or hormone treatment is not determinant of one's identity as transgender. In fact, many do not undergo such treatments for various reasons. This is what I have gleaned from what I've read, so correct me if I'm wrong. Should this be the truth, there is no objective biological standard by which one's status as transgender is determined. It is completely dependent on the incomprehensible condition of one's psyche.\n\nI took a genomics class last semester and the professor confirmed what I already knew; race is not a biological reality. Race is by all means a social construct. This, of course, doesn't make it any less real. But if we are to agree that both race and gender are social constructs, then how can we logically condemn one for identifying with a different race in earnest while lauding one for identifying with a different gender? The differences between the genders are more definite than the differences between the races from a strictly biological standpoint; consider, the differences between chromosomes and organs both internal and external. One might say that these are differences of sex and not gender as gender is concerned with the societal implications carried with one's sex.\n\nIn any event, in regards transgender individuals, we have agreed that one's actual physiology is an obiter dictum, a nonissue. Since details are still emerging concerning Dolezal, I can't say whether or not she earnestly identifies with the black race, though she does have a history which, in part, would attest to this. Perhaps she's simply suffering from psychosis. Who knows? What I do know is that should we deem self-identification absolute, it would be intellectually dishonest to write off someone who genuinely identifies with another race and cases such as these will surely arise.\n\nHonestly, I don't often consider my blackness unless the issue is raised by someone else. To me it is but one of many aspects that constitutes my individual identity as Chad Williams. It is more important than some aspects of my person and less important than others. My other demographic traits: where I grew up, the religion I was raised in and my socio-economic status all carry comparable weight to my blackness. Any individual's identity is comprised of countless traits, both physical and social.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

That Americans could be judged \"by the content of their character\" was what Martin Luther King and countless other valiant individuals, of all colors mind you, struggled and died for. We are still striving toward that goal. I would say that the principal way in which black people, and all people of color really, differ from white people is that their race precedes them. When they encounter a person for the first time they are subconsciously, perhaps blatantly, compared to expectations grafted onto them by stereotypes.\n\nThis effect is perpetuated by both blacks and whites. I've heard \"you're not really black\" from both white people and black people alike. Black people employ the term Uncle Tom to describe black people that don't fit their expectations of blackness just as frequently as white people might say something to the effect of \"you're not like most black people\" or better yet \"I'm blacker than you.\" Unfortunately these stereotypes are exceedingly negative. In my own experience I've found that slang and grammatical incoherence are so closely associated with black people that articulateness is considered distinctly not black. I believe sustained efforts to diversify work forces, college populations and the types of people represented in mass media will dissolve these stereotypes in time.\n\nWe have become very sensitive to race and culture, some might say too sensitive. There seems to be not only a willingness but an eagerness to identify something or someone as racist, overcompensating for the ills of the past. Moderation is hard to come by. We've gone from gross insensitivity to obnoxious oversensitivity. Hopefully we'll settle in the middle sometime soon, where we're sensitive to the cultures of others but learn how to not take offense so easily. I seek to inform others when I discern a lack of understanding but I also accept a degree insensitivity as inevitable. I believe that the term cultural appropriation is, at the very least, overused. To tell a white person that rapping is cultural appropriation, is to tell a black person that singing country music is the same. You don't need to grow up in an area to appreciate the art form from where it originated.\n\nWhat I mean to say is, relax. We're trying to come to a better understanding of one another. This is a commendable but not a simple endeavor. People will make mistakes.

We are outraged about a flag but not the senseless murders of human beings? What one fights for is very telling of what they really stand for. Just as everyone else has the right to stand up for themselves, so should the Black race, people that belong to the only true race, the human race.\n\nChange begins with mindsets. For this to take place, we must remove old fallacious belief systems that tell us to minimize ourselves and stay desensitize to the plight of Black Americans. Examine whether or not you have allowed yourself to become numb to the truth of the brutal history that the Black community has, and still endures today. Challenge yourself to scrutinize your beliefs concerning your views of Black people. Black Americans are not inferior, weak, less than, or deserve second best, and we are not second-class citizens as portrayed by media, worldwide. We are powerful, great, educated, happy, loving, and kind individuals just like everyone else. The fact that this definition needs to be given is pretty darn crazy, but until the media begins to portray Blacks and the Black family as viable, healthy people in movies, commercials, billboards, and on T.V., we will continue to explain it. Here a few things we can ALL do to usher in change, on the big screen, and in real life.\n\nStop believing the lies: Why do we have to be depicted as \"less than\" the majority of the time? It has to stop! We can no longer allow how the media negatively represents a race of people to govern our thoughts and belief. Begin to challenge what your personal views; begin to challenge the lying narratives.\n\nUnify: We need each other, and most importantly Black America needs Black America's support, period. We as a people must undo our tactically groomed nightmare of beliefs that keep us from helping each other. There's a reason some of us don't get along. There's a reason why we won't financially support our communities. The reason? We were taught not to. Recognizing why you don't help your people is imperative for change.\n\nDo something: People! Use whatever gifts and talents you have to bring awareness to Black lives. God gave all us all a gift, and now's the time to activate them. You are not insignificant, you matter, and your voice matters in whatever way you choose to use it. This is a time to teach! Look for teaching moments to let others know how it feels to be Black in America. If you do not open your mouth who will?\n\nStop deflecting: One thing we must all stop doing is diverting from the truth, no matter the issue. We can all benefit from the exposure of the truth. I get it, the truth doesn't always feel good, and that's why many individuals refuse to acknowledge the truth. Here in America, we love to be comfortable, and we want things in and around our lives to be at peace. Well, until the truth is allowed and acknowledged and justice is served there will be no peace. The murders that have taken place over and over again with no resolve will not just go away. In the words of John F. Kennedy, \"Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.\" Let's face it; we all know that our country was founded on racism. When will we stop ignoring this fact and start changing the reality of how we deal with racism from this day forward? The time is now, and we need to unify as Americans to fix this American problem. Murder of innocent Black Lives and any life should never be acceptable by anyone ever; there should be no special rights for a murderer. Open your mouth, use your voice and become un-censored in your communities.\n\nLet's embrace each other, America; we need each other now, not tomorrow.\n\nSharon Blake\n\nIf you have an inspirational story you would like to be considered please contact Mylifechronicles.org\n\nTwitter @sharonblessedbl\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "GOP Governor Candidate: Planned Parenthood Aims To 'Destroy The Entire Black Race'\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nNorth Carolina Lt. Gov. Dan Forest (R), who's running for governor in this year's elections, used an event honoring Martin Luther King Jr . on Monday to accuse Planned Parenthood of committing Black genocide through its abortion services.\n\n\"There is no doubt that when Planned Parenthood was created, it was created to destroy the entire Black race,\" he said to members of the Church of God in Christ in Raleigh, North Carolina. \"That was the purpose of Planned Parenthood. And that's just the truth.\"\n\nConservative Christians for decades have argued that Planned Parenthood and other reproductive rights organizations use abortion to eradicate the Black race, claiming that racism within the medical community has led to more Black women than white women being coerced into ending pregnancies.\n\n\"How the Black community can't come together to see that and understand the fight against ― I don't know. How the white [community] can't see that and come together ― I don't know,\" Forest said. \"And so we have a job to do. And the challenge to all of us is do we have the courage to do it?\"\n\nPlanned Parenthood responded to Forest's comments in a statement to HuffPost on Wednesday.\n\n\"It is unfortunate that Mr. Forest chose to push his extreme political agenda on a day that should unite us in celebrating the legacy of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. who devoted his life to the fight for equality and racial justice,\" said Susanna Birdsong, the Planned Parenthood South Atlantic director of public affairs.\n\nThis idea has embedded itself within some Black communities across the country, but only a few major political candidates have made the argument as publicly as Forest.\n\nWhile running in the 2016 GOP presidential primary, Ben Carson ― a former neurosurgeon who now serves as the secretary of Housing and Urban Development ― accused Planned Parenthood of putting the majority of the organization's clinics in Black neighborhoods in order to \"control the population.\"\n\nCarson also called out Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger , who in the early 1900s was a vocal supporter of eugenics ― the practice of selective breeding. Sanger, Carson said, \"was not particularly enamored with Black people.\"\n\nPlanned Parenthood has distanced itself from Sanger's views on race, saying in 2016 that \"the way to move forward is to acknowledge Sanger's wrongdoings, encourage open conversations, and continue to address racism and ableism wherever they exist ― outside or inside our organization.\"\n\nPeople who embrace the Black genocide notion frequently point out that Black women in the U.S. account for 28% of reported abortions each year yet make up only 13% of the female population.\n\nFilmmaker Yoruba Richen, who created the short documentary \" Anti-Abortion Crusaders: Inside The African-American Abortion Battle ,\" noted to HuffPost in 2018 that reproductive rights advocates and anti-abortion activists interpret these figures differently.\n\n\"The real question that reproductive rights people want to look at is why [more Black women get abortions]. What is it that is causing those numbers?\" she said. \"And it's everything from lack of sex education, health care access and many, many other causes ... You can definitely use that statistic in many ways.\"\n\nRichen also warned of the effects of an anti-abortion movement within the Black community.\n\n\"This is a movement that is being ignored at our peril,\" she said in the HuffPost interview. \"It hasn't gotten a lot of attention, but I think it actually is potent and effective and it seems to be making inroads within the mainstream abortion movement.\"\n\nForest, 52, seeks the Republican gubernatorial nomination in North Carolina's March 3 primary. The winner of that vote almost assuredly will take on Gov. Roy Cooper, who is heavily favored to win the Democratic primary as he bids for a second term.\n\nThis article has been updated to include comments from Planned Parenthood.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Why the \"Race\" Word is Wrong\n\nContributor\n\nIn the days following our AfroSpear Black blogger group's successful organizing in the Jena Six Justice March, one of the things that angers me about the otherwise excellent press coverage is the constant use of the words \"race,\" \"racial\" and \"racist\" in these articles. Although many highly respected minority thinkers strongly disagree with me, including Professor Ridwan Laher and the renowned Black blogger Field Negro , still I insist that although the sociological \"race\" concept can stay, still the word \"race\" itself must be conclusively abandoned.\n\nI believe that the phrase \"Black race\" is nearly synonymous with the phrase \"Black people.\" The greatest difference is that white supremacist groups prefer the word \"race\" because of its discredited biological connotations while the phrase \"Black People\" evokes Black self-determination. The phrase \"Black People\" is used to signify a political group.\n\nHere's what the white supremacist \"Nationalist Party USA\" says about \"race:\"\n\nThe Nationalist Party embraces the differences in Cultures and races, and allows for each group to embrace their own heritage -- while recognizing the right to live separately, if we choose; and to preserve our unique Culture and heritage. Nationalist Party USA\n\nClearly their belief in different races rationalizes, in their minds, their belief in and advocacy for segregation. And why not? Do we segregate dogs and cats at the dog pound? As soon as you concede that we are from different \"races\" you have conceded a fundamental point in their argument that we should live separately (and unequally).\n\nHere's another quote from the same white supremacist website:\n\n\"Michael Levin's long-awaited book on race has finally arrived, every bit as powerful and insightful as his admirers had hoped it would be. Why Race Matters does exactly what the title promises -- it removes all illusions about the insignificance of race, and explains what racial differences mean for a multi-racial society. It is a thorough, overwhelmingly convincing treatment of America's most serious and least understood problem. Like the work of Arthur Jensen and Philippe Rushton, it destroys the egalitarian myth, but Prof. Levin parts company with other academics in his willingness to tell us what biology means for policy. Facts imply conclusions, and this book draws them.\n\n\"The question is not why anyone would believe the races are unequal, but why anyone would believe them equal.\"\n\nAs Prof. Levin points out, a book like Why Race Matters should not have to be written. The only sensible conclusion to be drawn from simple observation is that races differ: \"To put the matter bluntly, the question is not why anyone would believe the races are unequal in intelligence, but why anyone would believe them equal.\" For centuries, people as different as Arabs and Englishmen have judged Africans to be unintelligent, lascivious, jolly, and keen on rhythm. Today, in whatever corner of the globe one looks, blacks behave in certain consistent ways.\" Nationalist Party USA\n\nSo, there you have it! White supremacists agree with Blacks who insist that we must keep using the word \"race\"! White supremacists believe it is essential that we maintain our belief in \"race,\" and they want to continue using that very word, precisely because science will never offer them any empirically-based substitute. The belief in the biological concept of \"race\" is the seemingly immortal brother of long-since discredited \"phrenology.\"\n\nThe phrase \"Black race\" has historically been used by white supremacist groups in their battle to isolate and marginalize Black people. In fact, Barack Obama 's effort to win the presidency is hobbled by whites' and Blacks' continued acceptance of the proposition that he is from a different \"race\" from whites. Whites have never elected a president whom they believe to be from a different \"race.\" Those who are willing to consider voting for Barack Obama are only willing to do so because they have realized that he is NOT from a different \"race,\" he merely has a different skin-color. However, the mainstream media and white supremacist groups will continually use the words \"race\" and \"racial\" and \"racist\" over the next 14 months to create a sense of fundamental biological difference between Barack and America that actually has no basis in biology. Yet, this is very effective propaganda, because Americans don't like to elect people who are perceived as \"different.\" They want to elect people who they believe are like them.\n\nEvery time Black people and white people use the word \"race\" instead of the term \"the Black people\" they give credence to the proposition that race is biological as well as political and cultural. I know from my personal blogging experience that if there is anything about which many white people and Black people are in agreement, it's that the word \"race\" is essential to how we see ourselves and our definition of our relationship to one another. And that's precisely why we have to abandon the word \"race.\" The word (not the concept of a sociologically distinct people) is the linguistic clothing of slavery, but we are Blacks are still wearing it centuries after it was forced upon us by our slavemasters.\n\nI know that there are a lot of good and great leaders (like Field Negro) who disagree with me about this, perhaps because they cannot separate the word \"race\" from the sociological concept of \"race.\" And so they cannot see how we can abandon the one without abandoning the other. But, it's really simple. Just stop using the word \"race\" and, as for the concept, describe what you mean with particularity instead of using once overarching words (like \"race\" and \"racist\") as a linguistic crutch. As I've said before, there is no pot of gold in the treasure map where the word \"race\" marks the spot. There is no magic to that four letter word, and the belief that our world will change radically for the worse if we abandon the word while keeping the concept is a superstitious belief. Keep the sociological concept, but loose the word! I can accept that many people don't agree with me. I just remind myself that most humans once agreed that the world was flat, while many white scientists once agreed that white people's head shape (phrenology) was indicative of intelligence while Black people's head shape was not. I trust that the inevitable march of science will compel us to abandon the word \"race\" as we abandoned the word \"phrenology.\"\n\nSo, when I challenge canons, I couldn't care less that they are canons. I only care whether they are true or not. If they are true, then they can stand on their own two feet, without having to remind anyone who long and how hard we have held these particular words in great esteem. If they are false, like the belief that the world is flat, then no amount of precedent can change the fact that the belief stands as barrier to increased knowledge. The most blatant area in which I challenge received wisdom is my insistence that we must end the 43-consecutive term white male monopoly of the American presidency in 2008. If anything is received wisdom in the United States, this is it, and it has to go. I am so determined about this that I believe I will not return to the United States (from Brazil) until the 43-consecutive term white male monopoly of the presidency has come to an end.\n\nNow, I need to apologize to professor Ridwan about something: It's not the concept of \"race\" as a sociological matter that I believe needs to be abandoned, and so I am not urging the abandonment of \"the canon\" in its entirely. I am merely urging the abandonment of a word \"race\" and its derivatives, in favor of empirical description of what we see in our world.\n\nWhat I see is skin-color-based historical and systemic oppression, subjugation and marginalization of people on the societal level, as well a learned color-aroused emotion, ideation and behavior disorder in individuals, a mental illness that is \"nurtured\" in the American environment (as well as in too many other places). In this area, as in all of science, careful description rather than broad generalization is our friend. It leads to greater agreement. When we conclusively abandon the word \"race\" then the age of science will have begun in this crucial area of intellectual endeavor."

      "text": "Healing Black People\n\nSpiritually Discerned; Doctoral Candidate of Clinical Psychology; Black voice and Male decoder\n\nHealing the Black\n\nDue to our earlier ancestor's tribal rivalries, slavery, racism, segregation, oppressive issues, and racial profiling, Black people have yet to heal their Black wounds. Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome is something that has impacted the Black race for many years to come. We have yet to heal those color complex wounds, and progress beyond it. Due to the Willie Lynch Syndrome, colorism, ageism, educational status, social economic status has created division within the Black race. With so many nationalities, groups, organizations, and running circles, Black people have learned to stay divided, verses working together in unison, while still respecting one another's differences.\n\nDue to our Post-Traumatic Slave Syndrome, Black people need help to heal their wounds. Understanding the psychology of behavior and embracing the need for therapy could be helpful, except Black people have yet to respect therapy nor psychology. Due to syphilis studies completed on Black people, injustices with the judicial system and Black people being used as guinea pigs by white America, Black people have learned to distrust psychology, believing it's some sort of hocus pocus. Psychology is something Black people also do not trust, due to Pre- conceived notions about the field. Although many people of all races have misconceptions about the field of psychology, many Black people view Psychology as a form of mind manipulation, mind trickery and a way to control or mess with someone's head. They also believe it is a White man's science that can only benefit the White race. When many Black people think of psychology, they have visions of Freud, White men, and hypnotherapy. People who misunderstand psychology have little to no understanding that, it is a science which studies human behavior, social influence and animal behavior. Psychology bases its studies on empirical evidence. Psychology is the study of the brain and mind and how earlier experiences, forming core beliefs effect present situations. Psychology is a healing field, designed to treat and diagnose those with psychopathology and or help people with normal stress. There are also different fields in psychology, like, Clinical Psychology; Neuro Psychology; Social Psychology; Forensic Psychology; Human Factors; Applied Behavioral Analysis etc Due to people being experts at being a human and having a great understanding of their self, their friends and family, they believe they have psychology nipped in the bud, without considering the fact of their own biases, transference issues, projections, which cloud their objectivity. These differences are what separates the field of psychology as a scientifically based field, versus normal populations with pre-conceived notions about the field of psychology.\n\nMany people assume the field of psychology can be summed up with two theorists, Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. Although both are two important figures in psychology, Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung were founding members of psychoanalysis. They did not begin the field of psychology. Many theorists in psychology exist and theorists continue to evolve. Psychology is ubiquitous and it is the study of people. Psychology began the moment humans were created. The moment Lucy, aka \"The Real Eve\" was created to be the mother of civilization, psychology begin to unfold then. The field was created to help bring an understanding to human behavior.\n\nPsychology can help heal Black people. Due to many Black people lacking proper communication styles within their family systems, etc those attachment styles carry into their friendships and relationships. Many Black people would rather curse one another out and use defense mechanisms to cover their wounds. The proper psychology has not been learned to communicate pain in a healthy way. The average Black person will go from hurt, to combat in a matter of seconds, without understanding the neurotic vicious cycles which are created when one assumes something of another and projects that expectation, which triggers reactions in others. Black people have learned how to talk to one another harshly and use defense mechanisms to repair broken egos and narcissistic injury. Black people have even learned how to use retorts that appear cool so that humor makes up for hurtful situations (Laughing to keep from crying). The average Black person would rather trade wise cracks with one another, verses using healthy psychology and proper communication to hurt feelings. Respect is a huge thing one demands but never gives. Black people have yet to be apologized to by racist people, society nor the members in their family, significant others and friends that have hurt them. Therefore, they are unapologetic. Lacking empathy is a familiar trait in the Black race, because it is considered weak to show feelings. Anger is accepted but showing emotion is rejected. Whenever Black people show empathy, it must appear cool and be accepted by the race. For example, \"RIP to all my n*****\" or \"Where i come from, it goes from respect, disrespect, total disrespect to eff everybody\". Both examples communicate emotional pain, but it is communicated in a \"I'm so cool and will not show weakness\" kind of way. Many Black people have experienced harsh treatment and compassionless from outsiders, members in their own families, relationships and friendships, therefore, they have not learned to control their impulses nor empathize with those they harm. Hurt people are conditioned to hurt others. Instead of hiding behind narcissism, defense mechanisms, unconscious conflict, mommy and daddy issues and developing unhealthy relationship patterns, learn to embrace psychology healing you from dysfunctional behavior.\n\nBlack people are the mother and father of all races and they are strong and resilient, therefore, they have learned how to push forward in life and continue moving and living with hurt. Since slavery Black people have been mistreated and have not learned how to deal with their wounds and unconscious conflict. Transference is a form of earlier childhood experiences being projected onto new objects, for example, people, places and things. A good example is, someone who might be attracted to certain people, rather good or bad because they are familiar spirits, with characteristics of their earlier experiences. Transference shows up in many of the things we choose in life, from friendships, relationships, jobs, places etc. A woman who was abandoned by her mother or father may choose men or women in her life who are emotionally unavailable or unsupportive during the most important moments. A woman who wasn't raised with her father may have unresolved daddy issues, while men who were also not raised with their father have a need to be a woman's daddy, to make up for their loss manhood. The decisions we make are mostly unconscious, so this information may be rejected consciously because the intellectual mind does not understand why they would choose people who remind them of the disappointments of their earlier experiences, but the unconscious mind chooses people and situations to work through the conflict. The Black woman choosing men who will not father her children, consequently playing both the mother and father in her household has been common since the early 70's. The Black man missing from the household has also been common since the early 70's. Although some Black people were raised with both parents, many broken homes in the Black race exists. Due to this family dysfunction, many members within the Black race are choosing the wrong people and making many wrong decisions, because they have not worked through their transference issues. You will find many men who are misogynistic or disrespectful towards women because they have issues with their mother and they never saw a man love their mother properly, therefore, they grow up to be just as unloving and hateful until they become healed. We usually learn from and repeat what we see and experience. According to Melanie Klein, children learn about love from watching their parents. They repeat what they see and do not see in their relationships and friendships.\n\nPsychology can help heal Black wounds. Dr. Joy DeGruy and Dr. Umar Johnson are both Black scholars who discuss the Black condition today.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Let's Be Honest: The Real Reason Why You Hate Black Lives Matter\n\nFaith and Lifestyle Blogger at Linen and Salt\n\nHome for me is Danville, Virginia. I love my home for being part of the foundation for the person I've become, but it's also one of the most racist places in America. Danville is the Last Capital of the Confederacy and the home of the largest confederate flag in the world. This is a place where I wouldn't suggest trying to raise an interracial family without judgement. My high school history teacher had a passionate infatuation with Robert E. Lee and talked to us about it like it was actually okay. Needless to say, issues about race are near and dear to my heart.\n\nOver the past few weeks, there's been a lot of racially charged dialogue stemming from black people voicing the desire to not be unfairly killed by law enforcement. The wish not to be killed has been met with a lot of push-back. Some people do not feel that blacks (or \"the blacks\" if you're a Trump supporter) should have the right to not get shot for things such as wearing a hoodie , playing with a toy gun in the park, failing to use a turn signal , selling cds , selling cigarettes , a wide-set nose , helping a mentally disabled client, living , etc.\n\nI've been perplexed to say the least about the outrage that the words, \"Black Lives Matter\" have ignited. It really confused me at first because I thought about my friends who are all of mixed races and cultures, and how I would support them if they were being negatively targeted because of their race. Especially if it normalized due to a long history of systemic racism, oppression, and bigotry. While I have had a few friends of other races speak up, I've noticed that the majority have chosen to remain silent. Silence in itself speaks volumes.\n\nI've also noticed the same 'silent on black issues friends' step up almost instantly to scream out \"blue lives matter\" (which isn't a thing, stop trying to make it a thing) when a cop gets hurt or murdered. The black people who I know don't want cops to get hurt or killed. Literally all we want is for them to treat us with humanity and to not shoot us for unjustified offenses.\n\nCops know the nature of their jobs when they sign up. It is a dangerous profession. Black people don't get that choice. We don't fill out an application and go through training to be black in America. We don't get paid for it either.\n\nSo I have a question for all of you who have remained silent or who have come out of your mouths with ignorance in regards to everything that's going on: Why don't black live matter to you? Seriously, ask yourself. Please stop trying to prove that you don't NOT care about black lives with arguments about black on black crime. Other non-relevant arguments are black people being disrespectful to the police &black people putting themselves in situations to get killed. You can also stop bringing up that some victims had records before being killed FOR NO REASON.\n\nYou're the only person in your head now so no one knows that you're racist besides you. Don't lie to yourself. Just acknowledge that at your core you really don't care about black people dying. Maybe you feel like we're disposable and worthless, or that the police are actually doing America a favor when they kill another unarmed black person, or that police should kill more of us so that we can stop living off the system while we sit at home eating Bon Bons, or whatever other false stereotypes that you have about the black race.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Talk to an actual black person about how these issues affect their family and friends. Take a class on African-American history. Learn more about systemic racism .\n\nThe majority won't take any of my suggestions. At the end of the day if you already don't care about the lives of black people, you probably won't care enough to make the effort.

      "text": "Math and Race: Why Don't More African Americans Do Science and Engineering?\n\nMathematician, TheWarrenGroup.biz\n\nIn November 2012, fifth graders from Rosa Parks Elementary School in Berkeley, Calif. won four of the top ten prizes in a regional math contest with over 90 participants, including the top prize.\n\nAn anonymous commenter -- we'll call him \"Aperson,\" and also call him \"him\" -- wondered why, when 44 percent of the school's students are African American or Latino, were none of the members of the winning team African American, and only one Latino? Haven't we had five decades of affirmative action?\n\nAperson ignores the question of sex, despite the fact that only one of the top ten prizes went to a girl, and cuts to the race.\n\nOf course we haven't had five decades of affirmative action, as Allan Bakke can testify: We had about five years. And Aperson's confederates who mock the role racism has played in retarding the development of black mathematicians are being ahistorical, if not A-something else: Race kept the respected mathematician David Blackwell out of Princeton University's math building in 1941, and only a decade ago, a black mathematician in Tennessee had to flee the state after receiving death threats from Klan supporters.\n\nI'll concede, however, that it is no longer 2002, and that direct racism is not the sole reason why there is \"such an egregious under-representation of black and Hispanic kids in the competition....\" Unlike Booker T. Washington or W. E. B. DuBois, today's typical inner-city African-American student has no respect for teachers or education.\n\nIn September 2012, I taught geometry at an urban high school . One boy's first words to me were: \"Get your a** out of my face.\" Another student was talking in class, using the S-word, the A-word, and the N-word. I asked him politely not to swear, and he snarled at me to stay out of his conversation. When I mentioned the great mathematician Ramanujan and magic squares to the students, one girl shouted, \"We don't care!\"\n\nI tried to point out to the students that education was the route by which they could escape their current circumstances, that people like Frederick Douglass had endured far worse than a ghetto upbringing, and emerged victorious. Rather than rise to the example of Douglass, one girl said that maybe they had a different learning style than he.\n\nFifty-three percent of African-American men drop out of high school . What Aperson must understand is that this dysfunction is not a matter of race, but of culture. I taught an advanced class on enumerative combinatorics to teens at a public school in the New York City area; most of the students who attended were of African descent, and one black girl, \"Lisa,\" whose father came from Guyana, was faster than I was at calculations I had done several times before. The town is 72.5 percent white and only 5.5 percent black.\n\nWhat accounts for the difference? Immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean are the most highly educated segment of the U.S. population. One day last summer, I was delighted to see that, of the seventeen or so students I was teaching in Harlem, four of them, on their own time, were playing around with quadratic equations: a Hispanic, a Nigerian and two Haitians. My brother, a certified teacher, quipped that the children of Haiti would swim to America if they knew they could get into a free public school. I suspect that most of the Asian winners of the Berkeley math contest also have foreign parents.\n\nIn conclusion, Aperson must understand that if Marlon Brando hadn't had to come to Berkeley in 1968, black America would not be in such bad shape today; but, looking forward, the solution to the problem Aperson has identified is to disaggregate the black race, and recognize that African and Caribbean immigrants are not African-American city dwellers.

      "text": "How Florida's new education standards are resurrecting old racist tropes\n\nWATCH LIVE: Journalists and political leaders take part in the 2025 White House Correspondents' Dinner\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nOn Friday afternoon, Vice President Kamala Harris urged a crowd of supporters at Jacksonville, Florida's Ritz Theatre to guard against politicians who want us to forget this country's history - especially its darkest moments.\n\n\"Let us not be seduced into believing that somehow we will be better if we forget,\" she said to the packed theater. \"We will be better if we remember. We will be stronger if we remember.\"\n\nHer remarks joined a chorus of criticism in response to the Florida Board of Education's new standards for teaching Black history in public schools. The 216-page document, approved last Wednesday, details Black history lessons that selectively omit or obscure facts about America's history of anti-Black violence. The standards, for example, require middle school students to learn \"how slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.\"\n\nCriticizing this latest prong of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' efforts to whitewash black history, Harris said Friday, \"They want to replace history with lies.\"\n\nThe NAACP and 10 other organizations have also written a letter to Ben Gibson, a member of the Florida Board of Education, criticizing the new standards for removing or rewriting \"the full unvarnished history of this state and country.\"\n\nPart of that \"unvarnished truth\" includes the fact that we have been here before. We have stomached the argument that slavery somehow benefited the enslaved before.\n\nSee, for example, the story of a man named John Brown. Brown was enslaved in the mid-1800s and subjected to excruciating experiments by a Georgia doctor named Thomas Hamilton. Hamilton believed there were physiological differences between Black and white people. And he used Brown's body to prove it.\n\nAfter he escaped slavery, Brown described what happened to him in an autobiography : \"[Dr. Hamilton] set to work to ascertain how deep my black skin went. This he did by applying blisters to my hands, legs and feet, which bear the scars to this day.\"\n\nThat happened because Hamilton, a slave owner, was trying to scientifically bolster the prevailing ideology that Black people were mentally and physically inferior to white people.\n\nThat happened because Hamilton, a slave owner, was trying to scientifically bolster the prevailing ideology that Black people were mentally and physically inferior to white people and, therefore, benefited from enslavement.\n\nThat thinking was so pervasive at the time it spawned propaganda like this print from slavery apologists, who pushed a narrative that enslaved Black people in America were better off than white factory workers in Britain. And it provided material for slaveholders like South Carolina Sen. John Calhoun, who in an 1837 speech argued that slavery was a boon to Black people: \"Never before has the black race of Central Africa, from the dawn of history to the present day, attained a condition so civilized and so improved, not only physically, but morally and intellectually,\" he said.\n\nThis kind of thinking gave rise to junk science like \"Drapetomania,\" which translates to \"runaway madness.\" It was a clinical term coined during the 1850s and based on the belief that slavery so vastly improved the lives of the enslaved they would have to be mentally ill to run away. The term was not removed from all medical textbooks until after 1914.\n\nHuman experiments, racist propaganda and fake science were used to push ideology we all know now is false. Black people did not benefit from slavery, obviously . And yet, the old racist tropes from the 1850s - that slavery benefited the enslaved - are now being resurrected in Florida. And middle schoolers in Florida may soon be required to learn about them.\n\nIn addition, high schoolers in the Florida's public school system will now be taught that race massacres, like the brutal Ocoee riot of 1920 , also included \"acts of violence perpetrated against and by African Americans.\" In reality, a white mob killed dozens of people in Ocoee after a Black man tried to vote and register others to vote.\n\nThose guidelines in the Florida Board of Education's new standards downplay America's history of anti-Black violence. And, as part of their campaign to Make America Florida, state officials want to export those standards nationally.\n\nThis is an adapted excerpt from the July 20 episode of \"Alex Wagner Tonight.\"\n\nAlex Wagner is the host of \"Alex Wagner Tonight,\" which airs Tuesday through Friday at 9 p.m. ET on MSNBC.\n\nAyesha Williams is a segment producer for MSNBC.\n\nTraci Tillman is a senior producer for \"Alex Wagner Tonight\" and \"The Rachel Maddow Show\" on MSNBC.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

      "text": "Multiracial Americans surge in number, voice\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nIf you want a good glimpse of the multiracial experience in America, get inside Louie Gong's skin.\n\n\"I'm Nooksack, I'm Chinese, I'm French and I'm Scottish,\" Gong tells viewers of a multimedia piece he placed on YouTube to help spark discussion of multiracial issues. \"... When I was a kid, I drank my Ovaltine with real milk, and my cousins and I liked our fried rice with salmon.\"\n\nAt the same time that the nation's growing diversity and changing social attitudes are helping to swell the ranks of multiracial Americans at 10 times the rate of the white population, the presidential candidacy of Barack Obama, son of a black man and a white woman, has brought new attention, curiosity and discussion to their experiences.\n\nObama has faced an endless barrage of questions anchored to issues of race and class, from his ties to the Rev. Jeremiah Wright to whether, in his own words, he is \"too black\" or \"not black enough.\" As Gut Check America engaged msnbc.com readers in this re-emerging national conversation on race, it became clear that multiracial Americans offered unique perspectives on the topic and that the nation is far from entering a \"post-race\" era.\n\nGong, 33, is on the leading edge of what he calls the \"modern multiracial movement.\" A founder of the Mixed Heritage Center, a Web-based resource collection for multiracial Americans, Gong is also vice president and a key spokesman for the Mavin Foundation, a Seattle-based advocacy group for mixed-race people and families. As the educational resources director for the Muckleshoot Indian tribe's college near Seattle, he is able to tailor programs to Native Americans of mixed heritage. He teaches classes and workshops on the topic and is helping prepare a museum exhibit on the mixed-race experience set to open in Seattle in the fall.\n\nObama candidacy drives new interest As Gong's schedule attests, it's a busy, exciting time for folks who have worked for years to win understanding and acceptance of the unique path trod by multiracial Americans. \"Barack Obama has stepped into the picture now and is shining a floodlight on these issues,\" Gong told msnbc.com.\n\nWith interracial marriage illegal in 16 states until 1967 and racist sentiments against it remaining to this day in some places, the number of biracial and multiracial Americans is relatively small at less than 5 million. Although it includes a number of high-profile celebrities and athletes like Tiger Woods, Mariah Carey, Derek Jeter, Vin Diesel and Halle Berry, it's well under 2 percent of the nation's current 302 million residents.\n\n\"There's kind of a lot of hype that makes people think there's more, but there aren't,\" said demographer William H. Frey, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution.\n\nOfficially, the number was even a mystery until 2000, the first year the U.S. Census Bureau allowed Americans to say they were of mixed race.\n\nCensus counts vary Even now, there is confusion over various tallies offered by the federal agency. Some surveys, including the 2000 Census, allow respondents to choose \"some other race\" in addition to every possible combination of all recognized races. That inflated the count of multiracial Americans to 6.8 million.\n\nBut the agency's annual Population Estimate Program, considered its most current breakdown, does not include \"some other race\" and results in a count of Americans who claim to be of \"two or more races.\" Based on birth, death and tax records, the figure \"really is our official estimate of total population and population by race,\" said Census spokesman Robert Burnstein.\n\nThe most recent data, released May 1, shows the number of Americans of \"two or more races\" was 4,856,136 as of last July. The headline, though, is growth. Up from 4,711,932 the previous year, the tally indicates a 3 percent gain, which is 10 times the 0.3 percent growth of the white population in the same period and three times the overall U.S. population growth of about 1 percent. It's about the same as the growth rates of the Hispanic and Asian populations.\n\nAmerica's mixed-race population is up 25 percent since it was first calculated in 2000, while the nation's overall population has grown 7 percent in that time. Although still small in real numbers, the multiracial category is larger that the combined total of Native American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.\n\nOne thing in common: marginalization Such statistical exercises bring a warning from Gong.\n\n\"One of the most important things to understand is that the multiracial population is not a racial or ethnic group,\" he said. \"What we are really is a long thread that runs through the spectrum of race.\n\n\"The only thing that bonds us together as a group is the common ways that we're marginalized,\" said Gong, who himself \"had a very dynamic experience with race\" while growing up. Reared on tribal lands by his paternal Chinese grandfather and Nooksack grandmother, his home life was steeped in Native American culture and tradition. At school, \"I was poked and prodded\" into a more Asian identity because of his last name.\n\nAs mixed-race Americans, \"although we don't represent a consistent experience, the way society has tended to respond to us has been consistent,\" Gong said. \"Those are the issues that we rally around.\"\n\nDespite their growing numbers, multiracial Americans and their family members say society's response to them often remains a mixture of ignorance, judgment and downright rudeness.\n\nDr. Maria P.P. Root, a psychologist and researcher on multiracial families who has worked with the Mavin Foundation, has catalogued \"50 Experiences of Racially Mixed People\" as \"a launching point for sharing, discussing, laughing, debriefing, and educating.\" The list covers everything from the ubiquitous, insensitive \"what are you?\" question asked of multiracial people to them being told, \"You have the best of both worlds.\"\n\n\"Gut Check America\" readers shared hundreds of observations and anecdotes via e-mail and interviews with msnbc.com to illustrate their own experiences.\n\nConfusion over racial identity a common issue For many, the confusion of others over their racial identity is the biggest, and thorniest, issue.\n\nTake Sara Dale, a 33-year-old daughter of a black mom from Jamaica and a white dad from Pennsylvania. Caucasian in appearance, Dale said she has often been the recipient of racist comments about African-Americans from white co-workers and classmates. \"People just assume that I'm white when they see me, so they talk freely around me,\" said Dale, a resident of Boynton Beach, Fla. \"As soon as the conversation turns a certain way, I start getting really nervous. I'm not a confrontational person but I feel like I have to say something.\"\n\nOr Evelyn Marie Lewis-Keene, 42, a health-care worker from Huntington, W.Va., whose father is an African-American and whose Hispanic mother was born in Puerto Rico. \"When they ask what race I am, I don't check black or white,\" she said in an interview. \"I can't deny my mother and I can't deny my father.\" But others can and do, often elderly white residents at the care home where she works who plug her neatly into their racist stereotypes. \"When a patient gives me the N-word, you know what I say? I say, 'Wait a minute, if you're going to say it, get it right, because you can't deny my mom.'\" And she insists they add \"Rican\" to the slur.\n\nIt comes from all sides. Lewis-Keene says her mother was disowned for a time by her Puerto Rican parents because she married a black man. And Lewis-Keene believes some members of her father's family treat her mother disrespectfully because her English is hard for them to understand. \"You can't choose your family,\" she said with a sigh.\n\n'You have a choice to be white or not' Non-mixed members of multiracial families face their own special struggles. \"When you're in a biracial family, you have a choice to be white or not,\" said Mary Semela, a white mom of two biracial sons who is married to a black immigrant from South Africa. Semela, who lives in Ellicott City, Md., said some members of multiracial families can grow so weary of stares and questions when they are with their relatives of different colors that they'll intentionally go to public places alone at times. \"You have that choice just to walk away from your family,\" she said, adding that she would not do so herself.\n\nWhile her husband and sons have faced the all-too-familiar trappings of white racism against blacks, Semela, 51, said her sons also are seen by some African-Americans as less than full members of that community because, with their father a recent immigrant, \"they don't have slave heritage.\"\n\nDespite that, her older son, 20, a scholarship student at Colgate, \"feels very anchored as an African-American,\" which is in keeping with the view of Semela and many other American parents of biracial black and white children that \"as soon as your kids are old enough, they are black people in America, they are not half of anything.\"\n\nBut that view is changing, said anthropologist Marion Kilson, who wrote \"Claiming Place: Biracial Young Adults of the Post-Civil Rights Era.\" Kilson, who is white, is also the mother of two biracial daughters and a son. She has been married for nearly 50 years to Martin Kilson Jr., the first black professor to receive full tenure at Harvard.\n\nNew resources, support seen \"I think there's a generational difference,\" Kilson, 72, told msnbc.com. \"My perception, when my kids were little in the '60s, was that biracial Americans didn't have a choice about their racial identity, that the wider society would view them as being African-American.\" Because of that, \"I thought it was important to emphasize that they were African- American.\"\n\n\"Now, people have an opportunity to proclaim all of their racial identities,\" said Kilson, who is at work with colleague and friend Florence Ladd on a new book about rearing biracial children. \"One thing that's different for younger mothers today, there are many more support systems, quite a number of multiracial groups that exist, that involve parents and children, Web sites, clearly there are books that weren't available before. There's a lot more out there to support them today.\"\n\nIndeed, it's a veritable boom time right now, said Gong, who recently attended a Northern California gathering with leaders of 13 groups that work on mixed-race issues. \"There seems to be a sense that it's time for the modern multiracial movement to expand into new fronts,\" he said. \"College campuses in the past have represented the low-hanging fruit\" for those interested in organizing multiracial Americans. Various groups represented at the summit are looking to expand their efforts into other institutions and corporate venues. Gong is particularly interested in multiracial members of low-income communities.\n\nA tricky issue for organizers like Gong is apprehension among some leaders of minority communities that a new focus on multiracial identities could lessen their numbers.\n\n\"If we look at what was important for communities of color during the civil rights movement, it was solidarity,\" he said. \"Solidarity served African-Americans and Native Americans very well in the past so now we see a desire to maintain ethnic solidarity still playing out, especially among older folks. We're worried that we're going to dilute the voice we have if people identify as being black and white or Native American and black.\"\n\nSo while drawing attention to the needs of mixed-race Americans, \"We really need to respect those communities' needs to maintain ethnic solidarity,\" Gong said. \"Those needs are very real.\"\n\nFrey, the Brookings demographer and author of a February paper on \"Race, Immigration and America's Changing Electorate,\" said that while \"race does matter\" in U.S. elections, it's often hard to figure out just how. With the nation's single-race minority groups skewing Democrat but still vastly underrepresented on voter rolls relative to their overall numbers, he said, the impact of multiracial voters is especially hard to divine. \"They're really pretty small numbers,\" he said. \"We're going to have to look down the road quite a bit before they're going to become a major factor.\"\n\nInspiration drawn from Obama candidacy But Americans from multiracial backgrounds and families (some 5 million Americans are married across racial lines and millions more are members of racially blended families) seem universally happy and proud that a biracial man is the front-runner for a major party's presidential nomination. Over and over again, in e-mail and interviews, regardless of whether they agree with his politics or intend to vote for him, \"Gut Check\" respondents said they were heartened by Obama's candidacy.\n\n\"I like Obama,\" said Ken Woodard of Wichita. \"This is something that I've always dreamed of, someone who has the issues down pat, not just running as a black man, but running as a man who is sort of all of America, not just the black race but every race,\" said Woodard, 61, a black man who has a son and daughter with his white wife of 27 years.\n\nLewis-Keene, the West Virginia health-care worker, said she sees Obama as someone who is \"wholly true-hearted in his feelings of unity from the simple fact of where he comes from. ... I feel like he is the kind of person who would be able to solve conflicts with other countries just as well as here in the United States.\"\n\nDespite the positive feelings from the Obama candidacy and other strides, ambiguity and confusion over racial identity will persist for many mixed-race Americans, said Gong, a fact experienced even in families such as his own that have been multiracial for generations. The palette of cultural diversity has often been smudged by outside influences like \"all these federal policies that were designed to deconstruct native identity,\" such as off-reservation boarding schools, the Indian Removal Act and urban relocation programs.\n\nThe ambiguity caused by such policies made planning a recent funeral for one of his aunts a bit of a puzzle, Gong said. \"We did an eclectic ceremony, which is now becoming a family tradition, where everybody had a piece of the ceremony. It was in a Catholic church, based on the reservation, and we had a traditional Coast-Salish funeral song, and also a Shaker Church ceremony.\"\n\nThe lesson is clear, said Gong, whose own excitement and enthusiasm for America's changing colors is indomitable: America's melting pot isn't going to create a bland, homogenous porridge so much as a deeply flavored, spicy stew.\n\n\"Mixed race isn't post race. It's not less race. It's more race,\" Gong said. \"In order to dialog about mixed race, we need more understanding. It's not a dialog to forget about issues of race.\"\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Reading from a prepared text, Trump boasted about U.S. health partnerships in Africa, boasting, \"Nambia's health system is increasingly self-sufficient.\"\n\nThe problem, of course, is that there's no such country as Nambia . There's a Zambia, a Gambia, and a Namibia, but no Nambia.\n\nAt the same event, the Republican strayed from his prepared text to tell the African leaders, \"I have so many friends going to your countries, trying to get rich. I congratulate you.\" Given the attendees' familiarity with colonialism, they didn't seem especially impressed by an American billionaire with a troubled history on race boasting about his friends trying to enrich themselves in Africa.\n\nFour months later, I think it's safe to say, in the wake of Trump's \"shithole countries\" comments, his standing among Africans is vastly worse. NBC News reported :\n\nIn addition to Ghana, the government of Botswana said Trump's language is \"reprehensible and racist,\" and said it has summoned the U.S. ambassador to clarify what he meant.Senegal's president, Macky Sall, said in a statement that it was \"shocked\" and that \"Africa and the black race merit the respect and consideration of all.\" His West African nation has long been lauded by the U.S. as an example of a stable democracy on the continent.The African Union, which is made up of 55 member states, also took issue with Trump's remarks. \"Given the historical reality of how many Africans arrived in the United States as slaves, this statement flies in the face of all accepted behavior and practice,\" said spokeswoman Ebba Kalondo.\n\n\"The African Union Mission wishes to express its infuriation, disappointment and outrage over the unfortunate comment made by Mr. Donald Trump, President of the United States of America, which remarks dishonor the celebrated American creed and respect for diversity and human dignity,\" the African Union mission to the United States said in its statement.\n\nCondemning the comments \"in the strongest terms,\" the AU demanded \"a retraction of the comment as well as an apology, not only to the Africans, but to all people of African descent around the globe.\"\n\nCNN's report added that African UN envoys issued a statement saying their group is \"extremely appalled at, and strongly condemns the outrageous, racist and xenophobic remarks attributed to the President of the United States of America.\" The statement from the envoys was released following an emergency meeting, called in response to Trump's comments.\n\nToday, South Africa will reportedly issue a diplomatic protest in response to the controversy, and demand an official explanation.\n\nAll of this comes on the heels of Trump scrapping plans for a London trip, which was apparently canceled in large part because the American president is deeply unpopular in the capital city of one of the United States' closest allies.\n\nThat, of course, followed Trump's decision to pick a new fight with Pakistan , announcing an end to foreign aid, blindsiding U.S. officials .\n\nLast summer, shortly after Trump announced his intention to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, Vice President Mike Pence appeared on Fox News and hailed the American president's leadership on the global stage. \"The world is seeing that we have a president again who is embracing his role as leader of the free world,\" Pence said .\n\nHow's that working out? Can anyone think of any countries -- other than Russia -- that hold the United States in higher regard since the Trump era began?\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Giuliani is out.\n\nRUDY GIULIANI, FORMER NYC MAYOR: America, what happened to it?\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF USA: Hey, I don`t need your vote anymore.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mitt Romney still a candidate?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He is.\n\nGIULIANI: I thought Mitt went over the line in the things he said about Donald Trump.\n\nMITT ROMNEY, FORMER GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS: Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud.\n\nROGER STONE, POLITICAL STRATEGIST: These are people who did nothing whatsoever to elect Donald Trump.\n\nGIULIANI: Never Trump. I will never vote for Trump.\n\nSTONE: Trump must resist this armada.\n\nLESTER HOLT, MSNBC NEWS ANCHOR: President Obama, he`s ordering U.S. intelligence to produce a report with all the enemy suggesting the Russia government to use cyberattacks to try and influence the U.S. election.\n\nCHUCK TODD: The Obama administration believes if they don`t do this review (ph) Trump never will.\n\nTRUMP: It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, okay?\n\nRON ALLEN, MSNBC NEWS ANCHOR: The fact that there isn`t screaming from the rooftops by conservatives, it shows you just how other worldly a state the United States is in right now.\n\nTRUMP: Who wants a hat?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO`DONNELL: Breaking news tonight, the Washington Post is now reporting that a secret CIA report concluded, \"That Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system.\"\n\nAnd just moments ago, the Trump transition team released this statement about that Washington Post article, \"These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It`s now time to move on and make America great again.\" Of course it is not one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history, not even close.\n\nJoining us now is Malcolm Nance, former counterterrorism intelligence office and an MSNBC contributor and the author of the \"The Plot to Hack America: How Putin`s Cyberspies and WikiLeaks Tried to Steal the Election\", also with us, David Corn, he`s Washington Bureau Chief for \"Mother Jones\" and an MSNBC political analyst.\n\nMalcolm, your reaction to tonight`s report?\n\nMALCOLM NANCE, FORMER COUNTERTERRORISM INTELLIGENCE OFFICER: Well, it`s not surprising that we would eventually get down to where the U.S. intelligence community drew classified information together and came and forwarded that information to the President of the United States, and we`re just getting worried about it. It`s probably months old.\n\nI mean I did my analysis between April and September and managed to come up with the exact same thing that the National Director of Intelligence and president released. This is just using real deep information. And I think it`s only going to lead to more surprising revelations in the future.\n\nO`DONNELL: David, a couple hours ago the news was that President Obama was ordering the CIA to do a report of this nature. That now tonight`s breaking news is, they already have a report of this nature. It was not supposed to be a public report. And now it has leaked to the Washington Post. And now we are seeing an analysis of what Russia was up to in this election that is much more detailed than anything we knew before.\n\nDAVID CORN, MOTHER JONES: First, we have to congratulate Malcolm for being ahead of the curve on this and really know what he was talking about weeks ago, months ago.\n\nThere have been lots of calls on Capitol Hill, mainly from democrats and some republicans in the last few days started joining in for an a public inquiry, investigation of what`s done. It`s quite clear that the CIA, FBI, NSA have been looking into this for some time. We just didn`t know what they had found. Although they did say in October that there were indications that Russia was behind the hacking, but there was a lot of talk to the campaign that Russia was just messing around to mess around and make things uncertain.\n\nNow, we have -- I`m not sure if it`s a report, it`s an assessment that Russia was doing this purposefully to put Trump in the White House. And almost more explosive in this Washington Post story, which I think this is bigger. I think this is actually bigger than Watergate now. And just as explosive is the telling of its story that during the campaign Obama went to congress and he tried to get republicans and democrats to join with him in calling out Russia for hacking DNC and messing around to make a difference in this election. And Mitch McConnell and another republican or two said, \"No, e won`t do it,\" which makes them useful idiots in sort of old KGB terminology and Putin`s handmaiden in helping him to elect Donald Trump President of the United States.\n\nO`DONNELL: That meeting was in September, it`s been so called \"Gang of 12\", according to the Washington Post report, and that is the leaders of the senate and the leaders of the intelligence, leaders of the house, the intelligence committees, democrat and republican, all together in a secured room in the Capitol where the Obama administration, CIA made this presentation, and the Washington Post reports this way, saying in that secret briefing, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell voiced doubts about the veracity of the intelligence.\n\nAnd Malcolm, it also says that Mitch McConnell said that if the administration went public with this information, he would treat it as a political maneuver by the White House and not a clean intelligence revelation about what the administration had found.\n\nNANCE: Yes, it`s almost disgusting. I mean, this nation was attacked through a cyber warfare operation, ordered by the former director of the FSB/KGB, what used to be the KGB, Vladimir Putin, and he ordered his intelligence apparatus to go a year in advance and to hack the systems of the DNC and almost every other component of the Democratic Party and allow them to take whatever information they could find and use it literally as Watergate 2.0. They took the information. They applied it, and they applied it to where they could choose one person to be their candidate, and that was Donald Trump.\n\nThe question here is not whether there was an intelligence analysis that should have been leaked earlier or not. That`s done. The assessment was being done real time. Our systems and assets coming from other intelligence agencies and our own intelligence collection are going to prove, have already proven this out. We knew that by mid August that this was clearly the Russians.\n\nThe big question is, what links did Russia have to the Trump campaign? Is this going to turn into a counter intelligence investigation to where American citizens may either have been in collusion, or were they actually just unwitting idiots or unwitting assets to use intelligence parlance and then became witting assets. And I believe by the time Donald Trump understood and made his call that Russia should release hacked e-mails that he understood Russia was working in his interest and he became a witting, you know, asset to them. But question is, who actually has ties?\n\nCORN: And if I can add to that, a story that I did shortly before the election, wasn`t much time before the election, I cited a counterintelligence officer, a veteran, a Russian counterintelligence from another service, not the American service, who`ve been sending reports to the FBI, of course, through the course of all last summer (ph), saying that he had evidence that the Russian intelligence services had tried, over the course of the last five years, to co-opt and cultivate Donald Trump.\n\nSo that gets to the point that Malcolm was raising, not only were they messing around and trying to created external circumstances that aided Donald Trump`s election, but they might have actually been trying to make connections with Donald Trump or the people around him to try to sway him in a way that was beneficial to Russian interests.\n\nO`DONNELL: And in some of the meetings that they had about this, there was a concern raised, especially on the matter of Russia`s ability to hack election results and hack into certain voting systems. There was a concern raised that any revelations about that might undermine the public`s confidence in voting and possibly even their willingness to vote. It could possibly affect turnout.\n\nAnd so there was a complexity in the Obama administration about how to react to this. The report indicates, Malcolm, that the Obama administration was not of one clear view of exactly what they should do publicly about this.\n\nNANCE: Well, that would be very typical of the Obama administration. This is a group of very thoughtful people who listen to the opinions of all parties involved, you have 17, actually 19 different agencies, but 17 which would have some stake in this. And you have to, you know, put it in context and you have to get all presidencies together and then you have put into an assessment like we see it`s coming from the CIA, and this isn`t the sort of thing you want to play with.\n\nYou are talking about the fundamental structures of America`s political system that is operated for 240 years without true interference. We`re talking about the potential of a foreign nation may have put their thumb on the scale and chosen a president through what could only be characterized as the greatest espionage mission in the history of Russia, if it turns out to be true. If it does turn out to be true, it`s just makes sense to try to go and find out who`s involved.\n\nO`DONNELL: And David, in the Washington Post`s report, there are indications that some of the democrats in congress who knew about this were disappointed that the Obama administration did not do something more specific and more public.\n\nCORN: We have seen. I`ve talked to democrats in the intelligence committees who would say more needs to come out. They wouldn`t tell me. They wouldn`t leak it. They kind of plotted and played by the rules. But in the last couple days, you`ve seen senate intelligence of democrats, and we saw Adam Schiff and Dianne Feinstein, the top democrats in the house and senate intelligence committees, say there`s stuff that needs to come out about this. Harry Reid said this, too, and people dismissed that back in October.\n\nSo I believe we need not just the investigation that the president has ordered, because that may or may not become public. We need either independent commission or a congressional investigation that is committed to holding public hearings and putting out a public report.\n\nI mean there is nothing more fundamental than the security and the sanctity of elections in a democracy. And republicans who don`t buy this, whether they`re showing that they`re not patriots and not even conservatives, they`re just opportunists who are willing to ride on the coattails of perhaps a tainted election.\n\nNANCE: Lawrence, can I add?\n\nO`DONNEL: Malcolm Nance, thank you very -- Go ahead, Malcolm, quickly before we go.\n\nNANCE: Yes. Just one quick point here, you know, David`s absolutely right. But the most important facet that should be remembered by republicans is, they are targets of Russian intelligence also. Donald Trump is probably been a collection target for the Russians from the first time he stepped foot in Ms. Universe in 2012. His mobile phones are unsecured. There was a myriad of wealth of information that a collector from a Russian version of NSA could have, and they could use it against them, too.\n\nO`DONNEL: Malcolm Nance, thank you for that very troubling last word on this subject tonight. I really appreciate it. David, please stick around.\n\nComing up, on his victory tour tonight, Donald Trump told the crowds that he doesn`t need them any more. He actually said that, and he seems to be proving that with his choices for cabinet.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nO`DONNELL: The senate is voting right now on a spending bill to avoid a government shutdown tonight after senate democrats ended a standoff over health benefits for retired coal miners. Democrats led by Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia agreed to vote on that after republicans agreed to take it up in the New Year.\n\nThe bill is expected to pass. Tonight`s bill is expected to pass and head to President Obama`s desk before the midnight deadline.\n\nUp next, Donald Trump actually told his supporters he doesn`t need them anymore. He really did.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nO`DONNELL: Donald Trump has a new transition slogan, \"I don`t need you anymore.\" Donald Trump actually said as much today at a rally in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: We want to fix up our infrastructure big league. That includes -- And who`s better at that than me? Believe me. I don`t need your vote anymore. But I`m telling me I`m very good at that.\n\nThat`s why I don`t need your vote. Can you imagine that? Four years, I`ll need your vote.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO`DONNELL: There`s big news from the Trump transition tonight. Rudy Giuliani is apparently out of the running for Secretary of State. Rudy Giuliani is one of Donald Trump`s earliest and most rabid supporters and was reportedly Trump adviser Steve Bannon`s pick for the job.\n\nNow, Giuliani, he claims that he has taken himself out of the running for that position.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGIULIANI: It was on November 29th. And I thought that the president-elect who my main interest was getting him elected, not getting a job in saving America. I thought there were enough choices, good ones, for him to pick that I wasn`t absolutely necessary. If I felt like I was the only one who could do it, probably, I would have stayed in.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO`DONNELL: The Wall Street Journal reports that ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson is now Donald Trump`s top candidate for Secretary of State. The Wall Street Journal says Rex Tillerson has strong ties to Vladimir Putin, \"Among those considered for the post, Mr. Tillerson has perhaps the closest ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, having negotiated a 2012 energy partnership deal with Russia. In 2012, the Kremlin bestowed the countries order of friendship decoration on Mr. Tillerson.\"\n\nNBC News has learned Donald Trump plans to name Gary Cohn, the president and COO of Goldman Sachs as the director of the president`s National Economic Council. Gary Cohn is the third Goldman Sachs` employee to be offered a job in the Trump White House. Donald Trump picked 17-year Goldman Sachs` veterans Steven Mnuchin for Treasury Secretary and one-time Goldman Sachs` banker Steve Bannon is of course Donald Trump`s top White House adviser.\n\nDuring the campaign, Donald Trump attacked Goldman Sachs` political influence over Hillary Clinton and Ted Cruz.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: I know the guys at Goldman Sachs. They have total, total, total control over him, just like they have control over Hillary Clinton. We obviously didn`t want the voters to know that he is totally controlled lock, stock and barrel by Citi Bank and Goldman Sachs.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO`DONNELL: Today, Donald Trump is getting some resistance over his pick for Labor Secretary, Fast food CEO Andy Puzder, over his past positions supporting immigration reform and foreign labor.\n\nIn the 2013 outbid for Politico, Andy Puzder wrote, \"The fact is that there are jobs in this country that U.S. citizens, for whatever reason, are reluctant or unwilling to perform. We need realistic and enforceable reform. It`s not so much to ask our government which consumes so much of national wealth to produce an effective and workable immigration system in return.\"\n\nTrump ally Roger Stone said this yesterday about Andy Puzder.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTONE: There is an armada of retreads from the old Republican Party, both the congressional wing of the party and the Romney/McCain/Bush burnouts who are trying to board this ship. These are people who did nothing whatsoever to elect Donald Trump. And they`re people who don`t share Donald Trump`s values. Trump must resist this armada.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO`DONNELL: Joining us now, Maria Teresa Kumar, President and COO of Voto Latino and an MSNBC contributor, and back with us, is David Corn.\n\nMaria Teresa, so we have a proposed Labor Secretary who is in favor of having immigrant labor come in to this country and finding a legal way to do it.\n\nMARIA TERSA KUMAR, PRESIDENT AND COO OF VOTO LATINO: Right. And solely that`s refreshing. But at the same time he doesn`t believe in a minimum wage. So it`s almost putting the American worker at odds and that`s one of the reasons why you shouldn`t be calling him Department of Labor, but instead Department of Management.\n\nAnd it`s -- I think it`s -- again, it keeps threading the wheel of Donald Trump when he is going out in Baton Rouge saying I don`t need your vote for another four years. It`s very clear that he is trying to hood wink the American voter and saying I came out saying I`m going to be for the little guy. But I`m really -- In fact, I`m actually for the big banks and individuals that are holding corporate interest above anything else.\n\nO`DONNELL: Let`s take a look at just how Donald Trump himself now completely undermines the whole thrust of his campaign, and let`s look at tonight`s example with \"lock her up\". Let`s watch this.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: That plays great before the election, now we don`t care, right?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO`DONNELL: David Corn, that`s pretty much the whole campaign there.\n\nCORN: It really is, because he promised. He promised those sucker voters that a lot of them were out there that he would prosecute her and lock her up. And Michael Flynn said the same thing, Chris Christie said the same thing, and what, oh, we didn`t really mean it. We didn`t care.\n\nAnd, yes, you know, I hate to say these words on T.V., Lawrence, but to a limited extent, I agree with Roger Stone. Oh, I can`t believe I said that.\n\nBut listen -- I mean everything that Donald Trump said, and Roger Stone got suckered too. It`s always situational. It doesn`t matter. There are no core principles there. And so he attacks Hillary Clinton for giving speeches, for giving speeches to Goldman Sachs, and then he puts the Goldman Sachs guys in who represent the International cabal of bankers that he also said he was against during the campaign.\n\nI`m waiting for Alex Jones` mind to explode, because there is no consistency here, because there is no principle here, and that`s what you`re stuck with anybody who supported this guy.\n\nO`DONNELL: I just want to read these words again, what Donald Trump just said, \"That plays great before the election, now we don`t care.\"\n\nMaria Teresa, no politician has ever said that about a position that they advocated strongly during a campaign. He seems to be going that way, in all sorts of ways, including alarming his hardcore anti-immigration supporters by saying he will figure out something to do with the dreamers. He will figure out some way of allowing them to stay, even though several times he very specifically said they all have to leave this country.\n\nKUMAR: Well, that`s right. And I think that this is where it becomes very difficult, because there are a lot of voters who voted for Donald Trump saying he really didn`t mean it, and then there was a core group of his supporter who said he means every word and is why I`m sticking with Donald Trump.\n\nSo it will be interesting as he shifts from one position to the next. If his supporters continue being as loyal as they are to him or if they turn out against him. And that is the danger. If these supporters who basically are, in many ways, incredibly, not only committed to him, but also this idea that there is a hypocrisy that happens in Washington, if they feel and take it with and say, \"Wait, he played us. What does that turn into?\" And that is a difficult Genie to put back into bottle.\n\nO`DONNELL: David, just going to back to Rudy Giuliani for a minute, the good news today is that Rudy Giuliani is officially out of the running for Secretary of State. We`re going to be spared to that (ph). And when you watch Giuliani talk about it, he`s trying to play it as if it was his decision, which is what people who get passed over frequently try to do.\n\nCORN: Yes.\n\nO`DONNELL: But the way he talks about it, it`s as if he`s attending his own funeral. It`s the saddest version of Giuliani I`ve ever seen.\n\nCORN: I got to tell, the statement the Trump campaign put out, transition put out today was unlike any other statement I`ve ever seen. It was post- dated. It said on November 29th, Rudy Giuliani told Donald Trump he didn`t want to be Secretary of State. That was ten days ago.\n\nKUMAR: Right.\n\nCORN: And so why did we not know that then? Why did not Rudy Giuliani do what`s normally done in these circumstances? You know this is a Dennis (ph) in Washington come out then and say, \"I`m removing myself from consideration.\"\n\nSo why are we finding out this happened ten days ago while his name continued to be floated by certain people within the Trump campaign. You know, none of it makes sense. But here we have the two biggest, you know, I think Trump surrogates during the campaign, Chris Christie and Rudy Giuliani, they`ve been dumped, and now the question is, were they also duped?\n\nO`DONNELL: David Corn and Maria Teresa Kumar, thank you both for joining us tonight. I appreciate it.\n\nCORN: Thank you.\n\nKUMAR: Thank you, Lawrence.\n\nO`DONNELL: Coming up, a white supremacist confesses to mass murder.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nLAWRENCE O`DONNELL, \"THE LAST WORD\" HOST: Today the jury in the trial of Dylann Roof watched a videotaped of his confession in an interview with the FBI to killing nine people at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina last June. Here is what he told FBI agents in that video.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDYLANN ROOF, SUSPECT IN CHARLESTON CHURCH SHOOTING: I went to that church in Charleston and I did it.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You did what?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: We don`t want to put any words in your mouth that`s why Agent Stansbury is asking you what exactly is that you did do.\n\nROOF: Well I did, I killed.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO`DONNELL: And the video Dylann Roof talks about why he did what he did. He tells the FBI agents that he targeted the church because he knew there would be African-American people in there. And here`s what he said when asked if he is a white supremacist.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Would you consider yourself a white supremacist? You know, sometimes that`s hard .\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROOF: . a white nationalist is a white supremacist.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What`s your definition of the two then, because you said you`re not a white supremacist, you`re white nationalist. What`s in your mind .\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROOF: I do consider myself a white supremacist, sure. White people are superior.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO`DONNELL: And here`s what he says was the first thing that made him develop those views.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nROOF: The first thing that I guess, I would say woke me up, you know, would be the Trayvon Martin case. You know, and that was a while back.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.\n\nROOF: What was it, two years ago? And, you know, I kept hearing about this kid, you know, and I`m like, eventually, I decided to, you know, look his name up, just type him into Google, you know what I`m saying?\n\nAnd then I read the Wikipedia article not showing about Martin and I couldn`t understand what the big deal was (inaudible). And then for some reason after I read that I typed in -- for some reason it made me type in the words black on white crime and that was it ever since then.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO`DONNELL: After the break, we`ll discuss this with Nancy Giles and Yamiche Alcindor. Yamiche has interviewed white nationalists. That`s next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: In your mind, the white race is the dominant race.\n\nROOF: No, I don`t think the white race is the dominant race. I wish it wasn`t. And I think there should be. That`s the problem.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO`DONNELL: Joining us now, Nancy Giles, the Contributor to CBS News Sunday Morning and Yamiche Alcindor, a National Political Reporter for \"The New York Times.\"\n\nI find this so poisonous and ugly that I`m not sure I even know how to talk about it. Yamiche, you`ve spoken to people, presumably not homicidal rampagers like this guy, but who share his views.\n\nYAMICHE ALCINDOR, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": I have spoken with people who share his views. The interviews that I have had have been with white nationalists who were excited about Donald Trump coming into office. They were right before the RNC.\n\nI talked to this man named William Johnson, and he was really talking about the idea that most of the times people who feel -- he feels, though, whites are kind of losing their grip on America and there aren`t many politicians who speak to that.\n\nHe was really excited about Donald Trump coming in because he felt like Donald Trump is speaking to the fact that white who are losing their grip on society and one of the things that he kept saying, because he was really pleasant (ph), but one of the things he kept saying me was that the founding stock of America is being left behind.\n\nAnd then when I ask him what`s the founding stock he said white people. White people are superior and in some ways -- somehow we`ve got that turn on our head and that`s no longer the case and that`s what I`m hearing Dylann Roof, that he also feels as though white people are superior and should be with dominant race, but aren`t.\n\nO`DONNELL: They absolutely do. And, Nancy, this distinction that some people are going for of, I am not a white supremacist, I`m a white nationalist is a crazy lie or meaningless distinction. They absolutely believe in superiority.\n\nNANCY GILES, CONTRIBUTOR, CBS NEWS SUNDAY MORNING: Absolutely. And the thing apparently that was the trigger with Dylann Roof was these misstatistical -- this mystical statistical information that black people are killing white people in huge, huge percentages which is absolutely not true.\n\nO`DONNELL: Which is something Donald Trump tweeted, a lie he tweeted.\n\nGILES: And it`s totally untrue. I mean, if you look at the FBI crime stats, crimes happen within groups, like more black people unfortunately kill black people than white people. And the same thing is true for white people. So this idea that there`s this kind of white genocide going on perpetuated by the black race is just crazy.\n\nAnd also, I`ve just got to say that even talking about this, like, you know, legitimatizing it even by talking about it makes me really ill. It almost -- you always want to say like back in the days of civil right, would George Wallace have gotten equal time with Martin Luther King? I mean, this is not -- this is just wrong.\n\nThis isn`t like we need to stick up for white people because this is racial superiority at the expense of another race. It`s wrong.\n\nO`DONNELL: This is a guy who couldn`t make it through 10th grade in high school. And there are seems to be a mental defective component to this, especially when you listen to this part, which is when they talk to him about how many people he killed. Let`s listen to this.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: If I told you nine people died last night, how would that make you feel?\n\nROOF: I don`t believe you.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: There was nine.\n\nROOF: There weren`t even nine people there.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was just a little bit over nine.\n\nROOF: Are you guys (inaudible?)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, we`re not.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: How do you feel in all honesty?\n\nROOF: Well, it makes me feel bad.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO`DONNELLE: Yamiche, he discovers there that he killed nine people. His reaction is there weren`t even nine people there. There were way more than nine people there. So he wasn`t even able to perceive what he was actually doing in that church.\n\nAnd then when he`s asked how it makes him feel to discover that it`s nine, he says, \"It makes me feel bad.\" This is someone who has some serious clouds in his brain.\n\nALCINDOR: I would say that he has some serious clouds in his brain, and I would kind of think, \"Oh, OK, maybe he didn`t understand that there were nine people there, except that he sat through bible study for 45 minutes and then proceeded to shoot people, at least two some people are alive to say -- remind, \"So I`m going to leave you here so that you can tell people how much I hate black people.\" And then he went around and actually starts screaming racial epithet law shooting people.\n\nHe also chose African-American church that was historic. It was Mother Emanuel. This is not him just walking in to the grocery store and shooting. So, well, I can say, \"Oh, yes, it`s down like maybe he speaks kind of slow -- slowly and he might be a little bit incompetent.\n\nAt the end of the day, this was a crime that was very well thought-out. He had manifesto, he had pictures. So I really can`t kind of buy into the idea that he is someone who is now confused about the fact that he shot nine people and feels bad about it.\n\nHe had so many chances to not to do this crime, including when you were sitting there for 45 minutes and they read scripture to him and introduced him to the other members of the church.\n\nGILES: I mean, it`s this textbook and I found that really kind of interesting listening to the interrogation. For starters, I thought it was such a civilized interrogation. You know, so calm and so kind of inviting and kind of giving him lots of opportunities to maybe show some sort of feeling or some sort of remorse or explain away what he was doing.\n\nAnd I totally agree with Yamiche, he was really off putting to hear this strange kind of slow way that he was talking with the strange pauses and lapses where you would think maybe this guy is just like out of his mind.\n\nBut when you go back and you look at the fact that he sat through an entire service and then did what he did, and then, again, to repeat what you said, purposely left people alive and said so you`ll tell the tale. This guy is pretty demonic.\n\nO`DONNELL: Yeah, demonic, yeah, and very, very confident of his racism all the way through. That he had no doubts about. Nancy Giles and Yamiche Alcindor, thank you very much for joining us. I appreciate it\n\nGILES: Thank you.\n\nO`DONNELL: Up next, we have more on that breaking news report that the CIA now has concluded that Russia intended, specifically, to help Donald Trump win the presidency.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nO`DONNELL: Now more on tonight`s breaking news, \"The Washington Post\" is reporting tonight that a secret report, in a secret report, the CIA has concluded that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency rather than just undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system.\n\nThe Trump transition team responded to the CIA report with simply this. \"These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\" Donald Trump named Republican Congressman Mike Pompeo, a member of the House Intelligence Committee as his nominee for CIA director last month.\n\nJoining us by phone is Ken Dilanian, NBC News National Security Reporter. Ken, how is the intelligence community viewing this development?\n\nKEN DILANIAN, NBC NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: Lawrence, thanks for having me. I just first say NBC News has not independently confirmed the post story, although it`s consistent with the plain facts of the case, I mean, the hack that the U.S. Intelligence Community has attributed to Russia, essentially appeared to hurt the Clinton campaign and helps Trump campaign.\n\nThe statement that the Trump transition team put and this wasn`t a tweet, this is a statement with their letter head repudiating the CIA was just an extraordinary moment in presidential transition history. And I`m not aware of any president in history for it. And the U.S. Intelligence Community will be wing it with alarm and trepidation.\n\nI mean, the CIA has one main cause for the president of the United States and there`s, you know, supposed to be a relationship of trust there. Their job is to provide him the best information, the best intelligence. And he`s starting out on a footing where he is essentially saying I don`t trust what you`re telling me, what you`re saying about a really important development in our history.\n\nO`DONNELL: Does it leave the intelligence community wondering if they have to find a new dynamic in dealing with this president, this incoming president than they have with any other president?\n\nDILANIAN: Well, that`s not clear, because the man that Trump has appointed or, you know, has named to be the next CIA director, Mike Pompeo, is a guy who understands the agency. He`s been on the House, Intelligence Community. He`s been over there for briefings. And that appointment was greeted within the agency, I mean, intelligence community with some joy and jubilation compared to some of other names that were out there.\n\nSo -- and Mike Pompeo is not a friend of Russia. And presumably he`s going to and explains it to President-elect Trump, \"This is what the intelligence says.\" So we may see this dynamic change over time, but it`s pretty clear that Trump views this assessment that Russia interfered with the election as impugning the election result and he`s not happy with it.\n\nO`DONNELL: We have to leave it there. Ken Dilanian, thank you very much for joining us tonight.\n\nDILANIAN: Thanks for having me.\n\nO`DONNELL: Coming up, this year, my Christmas day was the day before Thanksgiving. I`ll tell you why.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nO`DONNELL: And now for tonight`s Last Word, this year, Christmas came the day before Thanksgiving at one school in Africa.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nVICTOR CHINYAMA, UNICEF OFFICIAL: I can tell you that the desks delivered at the school, that`s Christmas for these kids. Christmas comes in December 25th and pretty much nothing happens in their lives. When a desk is delivered to them at the school, that is Christmas. You have made their day. You have made their year. You have made their life.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO`DONNELL: That was Victor Chinyama, a UNICEF official who helped me deliver desks to a school in Malawi on my first trip there six years ago. As what Victor said, just before that first truck loaded desks arrived. We delivered just 30 desks that first time, enough for one classroom, paid for basically with the cash in my pocket.\n\nAnd then when I told the story of that first desk delivery on this program, you got involved, and you created many more Christmas days at schools all over Malawi. The first year I invited you to help with what we decided to call K.I.N.D. fund, the Kids In Need of Desks, you contributed $2.5 million. You have maintained that pace since then and have contributed as of tonight a total of 11,493, 269. That money is now divided between the desks fund and a fund to provide scholarships for girls to attend high school.\n\nPrimary school is free in Malawi, but high school is not and girls need extra help to stay in high school. The high school graduation rate for girls is half the graduation rate for boys. You`ve contributed $9.2 million for desks and we now have three factories in Malawi making these desks. You have doubled, doubled the number of these desks in schools in Malawi, but most schools there still do not have desks.\n\nYou can help us deliver more desks or scholarships by going to the lastworddesks.msnbc.com. You can designate your contribution for desks or for scholarships. You can also designate your contribution as a gift to any one on your gift list and UNICEF will send them an e-mail acknowledging your gift.\n\nAbout half a million kids in Malawi sat at one of these desks in their schools today, thanks to you. Usually, three kids slide into these desks together. The desks that we delivered that first year are still in service and some new kids are getting to use these desks every year. And so at least a million kids have spent a year at one of these desks now and they never expected to have desks.\n\nThey`d never seen desks before a truck pulled into their school yard and started unloading desks. And whenever that happens, the kids always want to carry the desks into the classrooms themselves as they did the day before Thanksgiving at the Malamba Primary School in Southern Malawi.\n\nHere is what the classrooms looked like in that school before the desks arrived. This is a first grade class. The room was designed for about 30 students, just about the size of an American classroom, but there were 101 kids in attendance in that classroom that morning.\n\nThat`s Maureen in the green dress, who`s holding that green bag in her mouth. Maureen isn`t the only kid I`ve seen holding onto her school bag that way. Very few kids have backpacks in Malawi and so they carry their stuff in plastic bags, and there`s no good place to put those bags when they`re sitting on the floor.\n\nWhen the kids have to write, they put their paper on their legs or on the back of a friend and there`s just no good place to write when you`re sitting on the floor. When the desks arrived, the kids rushed out to greet the truck and the teachers use that opportunity to clean up the classroom floors for the arrival of the desks. And then desks started pouring into the classrooms, 300 desks that day.\n\nAnd when the kids took their seats at their desks, Maureen was the first one to start writing. That desk became a serious workplace for Maureen, instantly. Class participation immediately improved once the kids were at their desks. They were learning English words for fruits.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Lemon, lemon, lemon.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Lemon, lemon, lemon.\n\n(OFF-MIC)\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO`DONNELL: Yamakani (ph) told me that none of the kids had any idea the desks were coming to the school that day. He said he was very happy to be sitting at a desk, because he said, \"When we were sitting down on the floor, we used to suffer ant bites.\"\n\nYamakani doesn`t own shoes, so he`ll probably still be brushing ants off of his feet. Most of the kids at this school don`t have shoes and that`s how I measure the wealth of a village in Malawi, not by how many cars people have in their driveways because there are no driveways and there are no cars. Shoes tell the story.\n\nWhen you watch the kids playing and running around without looking at their feet, you can`t tell whose wearing shoes and who isn`t. The barefoot kids don`t think for a second that they are somehow limited compared to the kids with shoes. They don`t think there`s something they can`t do because they don`t have shoes. And the kids with shoes don`t act superior to the kids with no shoes. That`s not the way these kids are.\n\nNone of them have very much, at best, one change of clothes and maybe a pair of shoes. And then every once in a while, there`s the kid with just one shoe. Maybe she`ll get another shoe some day. Maybe she won`t. But she has a desk now, thanks to you.\n\nYou have lifted her off the floor and given her a place to write, a place to learn and she`s going to have a desk as she moves through every grade at the Malamba Primary School. All 1,052 students at that school have these desks now and they expressed their gratitude and happiness the way kids in Malawi always do. They burst into song.\n\n(SINGING)\n\nEND\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Need to understand the black race better so I stop calling blacks niggers and start calling them people. Like dad always said, you can't fear or hate an entire race cause [sic] of what one man did 40 years ago.\" The journal entry was logged at approximately 8:00 am on August 9.\n\nIn the next section of the journal entry -- written around 4 p.m, approximately four hours after Brown's death - Witness 40 recounted the fatal encounter. \"Omfg it was crazy,\" the witness wrote.\n\nThe witness described being turned around during the drive and ending up near a Ferguson apartment complex. The witness then heard a \"weird noise\" and saw a cop, presumably Wilson, engaged with the \"same kids I almost hit with car.\" Brown was with a friend, Dorian Johnson, at the time of the fatal incident.\n\nWitness 40's account is similar to how others -- including Wilson -- have described the confrontation between Wilson and Brown. The two men were involved in an altercation inside the officer's car, and the conflict continued outside the vehicle.\n\n\"The cop was wobbling the big kid turned around had his arms out with attitude,\" the witness wrote. \"The cop just stood there dang if that kid didn't start running right at the cop like a football player. Head down. I heard 3 bangs but the big kid wouldn't stop. I heard cop say something but not sure what or if he was just making noise. Cop took a couple steps forward then backwards and the gun went off 2 more times. The last one on the top of the kid's head. Omg the blood.\"\n\nRELATED: In Ferguson, a failure of leadership\n\nA man in a green shirt grabbed Witness 40 and said, \"Get your ass out of here,\" the witness described, adding there was a growing police presence in the area after the shooting.\n\nThe final journal entry, written around 9 p.m., ends with the witness telling someone -- the name was redacted -- about the incident. \"He told me 1st I was nuts taking drive up there and 2nd keep my mouth shut. He's prob right no one will believe me anyway.\"\n\nThe grand jury's decision not to indict Wilson devastated Brown's parents. Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for the Brown family, issued a strong rebuke Tuesday to the St. Louis County prosecutor overseeing the investigation into Brown's shooting. \"We object publicly and as loudly as we can on behalf of Michael Brown's family that this process is broken,\" Crump said.\n\nIn the wake of the grand jury's decision not to indict Wilson, Ferguson took a violent and chaotic turn Monday night. A number of businesses were torched and looted, dozens of gunshots rang out and 82 people were arrested.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

      "text": "Jeb Bush: 'I don't know what was on the mind' of Charleston shooter\n\nWATCH LIVE: Journalists and political leaders take part in the 2025 White House Correspondents' Dinner\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nDespite clear and mounting evidence that the mass shooting at a historically black church in Charleston, South Carolina. was racially motivated, several Republican presidential candidates on Friday refused to acknowledge the role race played in the attacks.\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a top-tier 2016 hopeful who announced his candidacy just this week, went as far as to say \"I don't know what was on the mind or the heart of the man who committed these atrocious crimes,\" during a speech at the Faith and Freedom Coalition's annual Road to Majority conference in Washington, D.C.\n\nRELATED: Faith and Freedom conference evacuated over 'credible threat'\n\nAfterward, Bush spokesman Tim Miller took to Twitter to say \"of course\" the Republican believes the shooting was racially motivated. But when a Huffington Post reporter asked Bush the role of race in the attacks, Bush said \"I don't know what the background of it is.\"\n\nAsked later, Bush again said \"I don't know\" but added, \"Looks like to me it was, but we'll find out all the information. It's clear it was an act of raw hatred, for sure. Nine people lost their lives and they were African-American. You can judge what it is.\"\n\nThere is little doubt that Dylann Roof, the 21-year old white man who has confessed to carrying out the attacks, harbored racist views. A friend of Roof's, Joseph Meek Jr., told NBC News that Roof \"believed in segregation ... he didn't believe in what the black race was doing to the white race.\" On social media, Roof appeared in a photo on the roof of a car with a Confederate flag on its license plate. And in another photo he is seen wearing the flags of apartheid-era South Africa and of Rhodesia -- now Zimbabwe -- another majority black African country ruled by white separatists until 1979. The flags are popular symbols among white supremicists today.\n\nA cousin of one of the victims has recounted a survivor saying before the began shooting that Roof told the group at the church, \"You rape our women and you're taking over our country. And you have to go.\"\n\nDemocratic 2016 hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have both mentioned race as a contributing factor to the Charleston attack, as did President Obama in remarks from the White House on Thursday. Republicans, on the other hand, have expressed sorrow and shock about the shooting but have largely avoided discussing the shooting in the framework of targeted racial violence.\n\nSeveral GOP hopefuls at the conference argued that such attacks cannot be solved by government.\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called the shooting the act of a \"pretty depraved person,\" but said \"laws can't change this.\" He added, \"Only the goodwill and the love of the American people can let those folks know that that act was unacceptable, disgraceful and we need to do more to show that we love each other.\"\n\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul said, \"What kind of person goes into a church and shots nine people?\" He added, \"There's a sickness in our country. There's something terribly wrong, but it isn't going to fixed by your government.\"\n\nRELATED: For 2016ers, Charleston massacre is treacherous terrain\n\nAnd others have focused on the religious setting of the massacre, with some even suggesting it was an attack on Christianity.\n\nFormer Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum did not address the shootings in Charleston during his appearance at the conference. But during a radio interview on Thursday he linked the shooting to \"assaults on our religious liberty.\" Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal led a prayer at the conference for victims of the shootings, saying, \"We just grieve deeply for our brothers and sisters who lost their lives studying your holy Scripture in a sanctuary, in a church and a house of God.\"\n\nOne exception is retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, the only black candidate in the GOP field. At the conference, he asked for a moment of silence for the victims, adding, \"You know these things hit so close to home. And if we don't pay close attention to the hatred and the division that's going on in our nation, this is just a harbinger of what we can expect.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Carson released a statement saying the shooting demonstrated \"racial based hate is still very much alive,\" while also suggesting ideological intolerance was a bigger problem.\"\n\nFormer New York Gov. George Pataki, at the conference on Friday, did mention race while speaking about the shooting - but he lumped it in with \"bigotry of any form.\" He said, \"What happened in South Carolina was not just wrong, it was hideous, and we have to stand up whenever racism, anti-Semitism, bigotry of any form roars its ugly head.\"\n\n\"We're all Americans,\" he added. \"We're all God's children. We're in this together and we cannot let bigotry and racism be tolerated in this country.\"\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine is interviewed. The Supreme Court upheld once again the constitutionality of Obamacare.\n\nZERLINA MAXWELL, MSNBC HOST: It`s a good point about all the potential abuses of power, and certainly, the co-equal branch of government, Congress, may want to look into that.\n\nCongressman Jim Himes, thank you so much for being here tonight. Please stay safe.\n\nThat is ALL IN for this Thursday night.\n\n\"THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW\" starts now.\n\nGood evening, Rachel.\n\nRACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST: Good evening, Zerlina. It is great to see you and I want to say before you go, that we had to ask you and your staff to move a whole bunch of stuff around today in order to accommodate things for our show, and I am very, very grateful to you guys for being able to do that. I made your workday harder. I`m sorry, I owe you, and I am thankful.\n\nMAXWELL: I will do anything for you. No worries.\n\nMADDOW: Never say that. Thank you, Zerlina. I really appreciate it.\n\nAnd thanks at home for joining us this hour. Happy to have you here.\n\nI will tell you in advance that we are having slight technical difficulties in terms of the technical aspects of getting stuff on the show, so in case anything looks a little bit hinky or unlike it usually does, don`t worry. Nothing is wrong. At least nothing wrong you need to worry about. Plenty is wrong, trust me.\n\nAll right. We start tonight in Marshall, Texas in east Texas. Really, really east Texas. It is close to the Louisiana state line, not far from Shreveport, Louisiana.\n\nAnd she was born there in 1926 in Marshall, Texas, far east Texas. But after being born in Marshall, Texas, in the 20s, when she was 12 in June 1939, she and her family moved 200 miles west all the way to Fort Worth.\n\nIt was her and her two siblings and her mom and dad. They moved all the way from near Shreveport, Louisiana, all the way to Fort Worth. They paid $165 for their house on East Annie Street and New York Avenue in Fort Worth, in the Fifth Ward in Fort Worth.\n\nIt`s a neighborhood today that is hemmed in on three sides by a zillion lanes of interstate and major highways, a sort of have the effect of cutting it off from the rest of Fort Worth. Back in the late 1930s, that was before all the interstates and all of that.\n\nAnd the most important thing to know about that neighborhood when it comes to young 12 year old Opal and her family was that they were a black family, that was moving in from way out east by Louisiana Lake. That neighborhood the removing into was a mostly white neighborhood, at East Annie Street in Fort Worth.\n\nAnd they move there in June of 1939, they had been told by a local real estate agent that it would be fine even though they were a black family moving into a mostly white neighborhood. It was not fine, they did not last the week. It made the local news and the headlines that are still hard to look at today.\n\nFort Worth crowds attacks Negroes. Violence climaxed observance of Negro emancipation last night when a crowd estimated of 500 persons stormed the resident of Otis Flake, negro, at 940 East Annie Street. The man hurled rocks at the house and then entered the dwelling and began carrying furniture into the street after Mr. Flake, his wife and three children fled from the house.\n\nFlake moved into the house last Friday. For four nights, since they`ve been there, police have watched the area attempting to disperse crowds that have assembled on a nearby corner to protest the moving of Negroes into a white residential district.\n\nHere`s another one. Negroes driven out, furniture burned. Mob evicts black from white neighborhood.\n\nPolice today were investigating him near why it that developed when a group of 500 persons drove Otis Flake, Negro, from his recently purchased home.\n\nHere`s another one: Negroes tenants are protested. This one described, quote, aroused residents, who have been fighting against encroachment of Negroes in the area. That one was actually published in \"The Fort Worth Start Telegram\" before the attack that drove the family from their home. This article: Negroes tenants are protested, described a crowd of about 150 people that had to be dispersed from outside their home on that Saturday night. It is quite possible that that article from \"The Fort Worth Star Telegram\" about the aroused residents fighting encroachment of Negroes was part of how the crowd, the next night, Sunday night, ended up at 500 instead of 150. That 500 strong crowd is the one that actually burned them out.\n\nAbout ten years ago, Bud Kennedy at \"The Fort Worth Star Telegram\" dug up the old headlines about that attack on the Flake family for a column he wrote. From the local headlines he was able to piece from the time, he was able to fit together the way it involves. Police might have said they were investigating the, quote, mobbing, police told the local press at the time that the mob destroyed the family`s furniture, broke windows and damaged the building, hit a man at the scene with a baseball bat.\n\nThe next day, quote, youths came into the house and turned on the gas jets and fled so the building would burn too. Even though that`s what happened and the police were supposedly on it, and they`ve been on it for four straight nights by the time the family was family burned out, nobody was ever arrested apparently.\n\nAccording to Bud Kennedy, quote, nothing further was ever published about the incident or any investigation.\n\nAnd like I said, she was 12 years old when it happened. One of the three children of Otis and Mattie Flake who were burned out of that home in June 1939. She`s interviewed about it later and she told Jackson this, she said, quote, people gathered, the police couldn`t control them. My dad came home with a gun, and the police told him if he busted a cap, they`d lead that mob have him.\n\nShe says, quote, if they had given us an opportunity to stay there and be their neighbors, they would`ve found out, we didn`t want any more than what they had. A decent place to stay, jobs that paid, to be able to go to school in the neighborhood even if it was a segregated school. We would`ve made good neighbors, she said, but they didn`t give us an opportunity. And I felt like everybody needs an opportunity.\n\nAgain, that attack that burned the Flake family out of their home, and what was literally the fourth night they were trying to sleep in that home, that happened in 1939, the summer of 1939 in Forth Worth, Texas.\n\nI want to put back up on the screen there one piece from that coverage from the time that quote about when exactly it happened. Remember this lead from the first story from \"The AP\" that I mentioned: Violence climaxed observance of Negro emancipation late tonight, when a crowd estimated of 500 persons stones of residents. Violence climax observance of Negro emancipation. What that awkward language from the newspaper in 1939 tells you is that this attack happened specifically on June 19th, 1939. It happened during the observance of the emancipation of African Americans in the United States.\n\nIt was June 19th, 1865, when General Gordon Granger and his Union troops wrote into Galveston, Texas, that was after the end of the Civil War, and they issued, he issued General Order Number Three. For the first time bringing news to the 250,000 enslaved black people in Texas at the time that by law they were now free. It was actually a huge mural there in Galveston on the side where General Granger issued that proclamation. It says, absolute quality, you see that?\n\nAnd June 19th has been celebrated in Texas, in the state of Texas for very long time. It`s been a paid state holiday in Texas since 1979. As in that local news article from 1939, the day was sometimes delicately called the Negroes emancipation. But what we call it now is Juneteenth.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris said today at the White House, throughout history, Juneteenth has been known by many names, Jubilee Day, Freedom Day, Liberation Day, Emancipation Day. Today she said, it is a national holiday.\n\nDespite the attack on her family home in 1939 when she was 12 years old, both young enough and old enough to be deeply scarred and scared for life by something like that, young Miss Opal, again 12 years old when it happened, she survived that attack along with her two siblings. She would go on to play an important role in local celebration of that holiday in Texas, specifically in Forth Worth where she live the rest of her life.\n\nShe was a teacher, she went on to work for a local food charities, and she ultimately became part of the Tarrant County Black Historical Genialogical Society, which led the local Juneteenth celebrations every year.\n\nBut in 2016, when it was President Obama`s final year in office as president, as America`s first black president, Ms. Opal, her name is now Opal Lee, she basically decided that she was going to go for broke. She had been doing this work her whole life, she had a special reason for this to mean something very important to her, to turn it into something positive in her life. But she decided she would go big.\n\nShe had written a letter to President Obama, essentially sort of warning him in the nicest way possible that she was going to come to Washington at some point, and the point of her trip would be that this Texas holiday, Juneteenth should be celebrated all over the country. It should be a national holiday marking the end of slavery, not just a Texas holiday.\n\nShe thought we should actually celebrate as a country from June the 19th all the way to July the 4th, for Independence Day. Same way we celebrate Mardi gras for a big chunk of February, she was saying let`s celebrate liberation and independence as a whole country together, for the whole end of June through the first weekend of July, Juneteenth in June to July 4th in July, let`s make that our national reflection and celebration of independence, liberation, freedom.\n\nSo she had sent President Obama her letter, but that in 2016 when it was his last year in office, she decided she would go see him. She would walk to Washington, D.C., from Fort Worth Texas. She was 89 years old, but she did that.\n\nAgain that was 2016, she has been leading a national effort, a national effort to have the holiday recognize all these years. She said that she wanted to bring 100,000 signatures on a petition with Congress, when she went to Capitol Hill in 2020. By the time she got to Capitol Hill with her petition in September of last year, September 2020, she didn`t have 100,000 signatures on her petition, she had 1.5 million signatures on her petition.\n\nNow, she didn`t succeed in her goal on that trip to Washington September last year. But you know, try and try again. In February of this year, the legislation actually to create the holiday was introduced yet again, and this time, we`ll, like she said, everybody needs an opportunity. When the House passed it yesterday, Ms. Opal, Ms. Opal Lee, 94 years old, said she was overwhelmed with emotion.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOPAL LEE, JUNETEENTH ACTIVIST: I`ve got so many different feelings, burgling up here. I don`t know what to call them all. I`m so delighted to know that finally we`ve got a Juneteenth bill passed.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMADDOW: So many feelings burgling up, I don`t know what to call them all.\n\nThe House today held a signing ceremony to formally convey their passage of the bill and send it to the president for his signature, they don`t have to do that, but for something like this, you would do that right?\n\nOne Republican Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson for gradually dropped his opposition this week in the Senate passed it, Vice President Harris the Senate proclamation in her capacity as president of the Senate, she doesn`t have to do that but again for something like this you do it, right?\n\nPresident Biden was in Geneva for his summit with the Russian president only yesterday afternoon, it was not at all clear when he would be back in planning to sign the bill, but you know, June 19th is Saturday, so little hurry up was going to be worth it to be able to celebrated as a country for the first time this year. Not just this year, but this week, right now. And by right now, I mean this afternoon in the East Room at the White House.\n\nMs. Opal Lee was on hand for the signing ceremony. She was given pride of place with a front row seat alongside roughly 80 members of Congress, and local officials, and activists, and community leaders who advocated for this. Her outsize role in the events that led to the passage of the bill also warranted a place for her in the president`s remarks tonight.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nKAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Throughout history, Juneteenth has been known by many names, Jubilee Day, Freedom Day, Liberation Day, Emancipation Day and today, a national holiday.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd looking out across this room, I see the advocates, the activist, the leaders, who had been calling for this day for so long, including the one and only, Miss Opal Lee.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHARRIS: Who just received a special recognition from the president of the United States.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMADDOW: Opal Lee today receiving a special thanks and congratulations from a kneeling president of the United States, you don`t see that very often.\n\nAfter that acknowledgment, it was President Biden`s turn to mark the occasion. The president noted that Juneteenth celebrates a day, of what he called, profound weight, but also profound power. A day on which Americans much remember, quote, the moral stain and the terrible toll that slavery took on the country, but also it`s extraordinary capacity to heal and to hope and to make a better version of ourselves.\n\nPresident Biden said today was not enough to just commemorate Juneteenth, to honor the true meaning of Juneteenth we have to continue towards that promise because we have not gotten there yet. He said his administration is committed to getting there.\n\nHe also referenced the continued attacks on voting rights, led by Republican-led legislatures, saying the journey would not be easy so long as the sacred right to vote remains under attack, and then he to singled out Ms. Lee for helping us getting to where we finally find ourselves today as a country.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are blessed to mark the day in the presence of Ms. Opal Lee. As my mother say, God love her.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI had the honor of meeting her in Nevada more than a year ago. She told me she loved me, and I believed it. I wanted to believe it.\n\nMs. Opal, you`re incredible. A daughter of Texas, grandmother of a movement to make Juneteenth a federal holiday. You are an incredible movement, Ms. Opal, you really are.\n\nShe`s made it a mission that this day came. It was almost a singular mission. She has walked for miles and miles, literally and figuratively, to bring attention to Juneteenth, to make this day possible. I ask, once again, we all stand and give her a warm welcome.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMADDOW: Ninety-forty years old, and a remarkable acknowledgment of the work of Ms. Opal Lee today at the White House.\n\nYou think about the two sides of this in her life, right? Twelve years old, Juneteenth, 1939, her family is burned out of their home in Texas by a white mob. There`s never anybody held accountable for it, never anybody arrested.\n\nShe lived her life celebrating the Juneteenth holiday in Texas, helping Texans recognize it, and they do in that state. She decides the country needs to celebrate the holiday not because of what was decided to be done wrong to her that she wants the country to know about it. It`s the last thing she ever wants to talk about. Anytime anybody interviews her about the crusade, it`s about celebrating the end of slavery.\n\nTurning that day, which for her family was the darkest day imaginable, into something that is bright and positive and a moment of reflection for the country.\n\nAfter that recognition today from the president, of course time to sign the bill, the president called it an enormous honor to do so. He said today signing would go down as one of the greatest honors of his presidency. He made sure that Ms. Lee got a special souvenir to mark the historic day. The first pen he used.\n\nShe seemed bawled over by the pen to the point where she dropped it, but Vice President Harris picked it up for her. She said thank you.\n\nYou know, this is not to say things aren`t going to get weird about the observance and recognition of this holiday. Things are particularly weird on the right, right now, in American politics. And so, how is the holiday going to roll out across the country? We`ll see.\n\nCongress and the president cannot actually proclaim a national holiday. Being shorthanded it is a national holiday, but it`s not. Congress and the president can`t force the wide observance of something in the same way in all 50 states. They can only declare a federal holiday not a national holiday. That means is to be observed by federal workers wherever they work in the country. It`s also to be observed in Washington, D.C.\n\nBut in every state, it`s every states call as to whether or not they acknowledge and recognize the holiday and how they do so. It`s an interesting political dynamic that in Texas, Juneteenth has been observed as a paid state holiday since the end of the seventies. Maybe that will take some of the fear out of it for Republican controlled states around the country that Texas doesn`t and has long done it and it`s okay. We`ll see.\n\nThe photos from the president`s signing ceremony today will reflect for history that Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas was there at the desk when the president signed it, among all those Democrats and Ms. Opal Lee. Yes, Ms. Opal Lee was there and all those Democrats supported, and so is John Cornyn of Texas, and maybe that will help.\n\nYou know, there is at least one Republican state legislator candidate in Virginia who is already proclaimed that this weekend, he will hold a Juneteenth community shooting day, a gun rally, a community shooting for Juneteenth. The good folks at Fox News prepared last night for the signing of this new law commemorating the end of slavery today, by running and interview by one of their primetime hosts that was all about how black people just have lower IQs than white people, and that explains why black people do get paid less for their work and why they should get paid less because the biological inferiority of the black race.\n\nThat wasn`t 1939 at the mob attack on East Annie Street in Fort Worth. Well, actually, it was. But that interview on the Fox streaming channel conducted by one of the primetime hosts was last night.\n\nWe have a new national holiday commemorating the end of slavery, as of today. Federal workers will have tomorrow off in honor of the Juneteenth holiday, Juneteenth this year is Saturday, it will be observed tomorrow. We`ve got a new holiday for that at us today. Thanks in large part to Opal Lee.\n\nWe`ve also got a long, long way to go on this, and it`s not going to be a straight line.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nMADDOW: It was just three days after the horrific world changing terrorist attacks of 9/11 when Congress voted on the resolution to authorize the use of U.S. military force in response. That legally and formally started would ultimately become known as the War on Terror.\n\nBut in the immediate wake of that attack on the country, again, just a couple days after the attack, not a single member of Congress voted against authorizing that use of military force. Except for one.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREP. BARBARA LEE (D-CA): This unspeakable act on the United States is really forcing me to rely on my moral compass, my conscience, and my god for direction. September 11th changed the world. Our deepest fears now haunt us. Yet I am convinced that military action will not prevent further acts of international terrorism against the United States.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMADDOW: Can you imagine how scary it must have been to stand up and say that? I mean, we were so terrorized and terrified as a country, but to have that courage of conviction, to have that sense of purpose and moral compass, to have the bravery to stand up and say this horrific act has made me come to a different conclusion than all the rest of you, then every other member of congress. Imagine what that took in the moment?\n\nCalifornia Congresswoman Barbara Lee was the sole member of Congress who decided that day that the tragedy of 9/11, days earlier, horrible as it was, was not a good justification for an open-ended legal authorization to get the U.S. involved anywhere in the world in what would become decades of war.\n\nA year later, the House was set to vote on yet another blanket authorization for these military forces this one pegs to an invasion of Iraq. That time when the vote came for the AUMF, Barbara Lee was not alone. A hundred thirty-two of her fellow House maunders voted with her against authorizing the use of force for the Iraq war. That wasn`t enough to stop the bill. And so, instead of one forever war, America then had two.\n\nThis year will mark 20 years since Congressman Barbara Lee took that first vote against Americas an ending wars. It`s the legal authorization that allowed America to use military force in the name of 9/11 in a way that was an ended and global.\n\nDuring the time those authorizations for the use of force have remained in place, they`ve been used as justification for all kinds of military interventions all around the world, even ones that had precisely zero to do with Iraq or Afghanistan or 9/11. It became a blanket authorization for the use of military force at the presidents say so that Congress ever having to weigh in again.\n\nNow, all of a sudden, things appear to be changing. Today, the House of Representatives voted on a resolution to repeal the authorization for use of military force, the second one, the one that started the Iraq war. The lead sponsor of the bill to end one of America`s longest war, and to repeal that authorization for the use of military force was none other than the same congresswoman, Barbara Lee. And this time, she not only had company, but the majority was on her side.\n\nThe resolution to repeal the authorization for the use of military force passed 268 to 161. Persist. Persist, persist, persist. Takes forever, and then all of a sudden, it happens.\n\nJoining us now is Democratic California Congressman Barbara Lee.\n\nCongresswoman Lee, it`s a real pleasure to have you here. Thank you so much. It`s been a huge day today.\n\nLEE: Thank you. Nice being with you, Rachel.\n\nMADDOW: Before I actually ask you about -- I have to ask you about the Juneteenth vote, and the signing ceremony. Am I correct you were at the signing ceremony today when President Biden made it a law?\n\nLEE: Oh yes, I was there!\n\nMADDOW: How was it?\n\nLEE: Thank you for covering, this Rachel, because this is quite a historical moment for our country. We need to make sure these stories are told about everyone in our country, including African-Americans and the horrific, barbaric middle passage, and slavery, and what happened.\n\nI just have to say, it`s personal for me also, because my grandfather who helped raise me in Texas, was born in Galveston, Texas, in 1875 and my great grandmother, Fanny Wilson (ph), was enslaved in around Galveston and one of the small towns. So this is really a major deal.\n\nWe`ve celebrated it all our lives. I moved to California in 1960, but I continue to celebrate Juneteenth and my family did. This is really remarkable, but it is a moment for us to recommit ourselves to finish the unfinished business of justice and racial equity, and true freedom for African Americans.\n\nMADDOW: For you, given the personal connection that you just described to the national commemoration of Juneteenth, and your personal role, your honestly legendary bravery on authorizing military force after the terrorist attack of 9/11, to have those two things coming together at the same time, in the House, literally within 24 hours -- this must be a momentous time in your life? This must feel like you`ve risen to the peak?\n\nLEE: Rachel, I tell you, it`s overwhelming in some respects, but it just reminds me that this is a long haul we`re in. It`s not a sprint, it`s a marathon. And I hope that our young people understand that the fight for justice, the fight for democracy and to protect our Constitution, sometimes it just doesn`t happen right away, but we have to be persistent. We have to know what we`re doing. We have to believe.\n\nMy dad was in the military 25 years, I`m a military brat, and there was no way that I could authorize the use of force forever, and that was a 60-word resolution right after 9/11, authorizations that I just could not support.\n\nMADDOW: It was interesting to see, I think it was 49 Republican members of the house joined more than 200 Democrats in making this vote happen. I wanted to ask if you were surprised by how bipartisan this vote was? I feel like I`ve seen some interesting contours where this issue of authorizing military force -- and indeed the use of American military force around the world doesn`t always fall neatly on partisan lines.\n\nI wanted to ask of those vote total surprise you at all, and if that gives you any confidence in predicting what might happen in the Senate? Which of course would need to do the same thing in order for this to get to President Biden`s desk.\n\nLEE: Well, Rachel, we built the support over the years, and I just want to say I have to thank the chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Congressman Gregory Meeks, and Speaker Pelosi and Mr. Hoyer for helping us navigate this to help us getting it to the floor. But the American Legion supported it. The Americans for Prosperity (INAUDIBLE) friends committee, so this didn`t just happen overnight. We had built bipartisan support over the years.\n\nAnd I was very pleased that we got 49 Republican votes. I`ve been working with so many and I have to remember Walter Jones, who passed away a few years ago. He helped me start making this be a bipartisan effort. So, here we are moving into the Senate. I`ve spoken with Senator Kaine. We`re cautiously optimistic that we will be able to move this forward.\n\nThe president has indicated that he is ready to sign it. He issued what we call a statement of support, a SAP. And we have to keep working. I am hopeful and confident that sooner or later, hopefully this year, we will get this to President Biden`s desk for a signature.\n\nMADDOW: Well, it is -- it is your work that is bearing fruit tonight and in so many ways. I don`t know about your personal situation in your life right now, Congresswoman Lee, but you better have somebody who has bought two flowers or at least a cocktail tonight, because this is the culmination of a lot of very hard work. And it`s a testament to your leadership, ma`am. Thank you so much.\n\nLEE: Thank you, Rachel. Really enjoyed being here with you.\n\nMADDOW: All right. As I said that bill that passed the House today in an overwhelming vote, and a very bipartisan vote, it now heads to the Senate.\n\nAnd as Congressman Lee just said, the chief advocates for repealing this, this authorization for the use of military force, chief advocate for repealing that in the Senate has been Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine. Senator Kaine also happens to sit on the Foreign Relations Committee. That`s going to be the first place it gets a vote in the Senate.\n\nSenator Kaine joins us live now.\n\nSenator, thank you so much for being here, I really appreciate you taking the time tonight.\n\nSEN. TIM KAINE (D-VA): Rachel, it`s great to be with you and especially to follow Barbara because she`s been just so fantastic on this issue. Juneteenth and AUMF repeal, she needs to buy a lottery ticket before midnight tonight, I think today is a very lucky day for her.\n\nMADDOW: Senator, she said that she has talked to you about what happens here next. As I -- as I mention, I feel like the partisan lines don`t map neatly unto this issue, either in terms of using military force in specific instances, or the idea of these open-ended authorizations when it never has to come back to Congress and we essentially cede that power to the president in a way that the Constitution didn`t mean for us to do.\n\nBecause it doesn`t have neat partisan lines, and neat partisan mapping, I do feel like these things are hard to predict in the Senate. Do you share Congressman Lee`s cautious optimism that this repeal is going to pass the Senate, too?\n\nKAINE: Rachel, I do. I`m not so cautious. I think we`re going to get a great vote in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday. I have a co-sponsor in this effort to repeal, both the Iraq War resolutions, 1991 in 2002. Congress passes these war resolutions and never repeals them, and they float out there in space like zombies that can be used by mischief making executives to do damage.\n\nSo, it was a historical vote in the House because Congress doesn`t have a track record of repealing these. But together with Todd Young, Todd Young, constitutional conservation Indiana, marine veteran, he is my chief cosponsor on this bill. If you think about Barbara Lee, who`s one of the most progressive members of Congress, Todd Young, constitutional conservative, I`m 63 years old and I still haven`t figured out the label for myself, but I think that we have a great path to a strong bipartisan vote on Tuesday, and then we have both the House bill that Barbara has championed, our Senate bill and then we are writing the defense authorizing right now and that might also be in place to put the repeal of the Iraq resolution.\n\nSo, we have a couple of vehicles. We`re going to have to talk about the fastest way to get this to Joe Biden`s desk. But this will be a big historic step, and you wrote a book about it in 2012, your book \"Drift\" about the way we have switched from Congress declares war, the legislative branch, no other country doesn`t like that, but that`s what our framers decided would be best. We drifted to unilateral executive wars and that`s been to our nation`s detriment. This is about Article One branch trying to pull some of this power back to the way it was intended to be.\n\nMADDOW: Because of that -- first of all, thank you for plugging my book, I`m not sure this might be a first in a cable news history where the guest plugs the host`s book. This is man bites a dog. But I will say, because of that dynamic that we were describing, that basic constitutional dynamic which I think is at play here, it seems to me like a dispositive thing, like a really important positive thing that President Biden supports doing this.\n\nI mean, the beneficiary of these open-ended authorizations where military force can be used anywhere in the world indefinitely without ever having to come back to Congress for their say so, the beneficiary of that is the commander-in-chief you can order military action without having to consult with Congress. For a president to say, you know at, I should not have that power in an open-ended way, we should return it to the way that the Constitution intended these authorizations should be ended, and if we need a new one for a specific reason we will pass it then and it won`t be open- ended. That she seems like a counterintuitive thing for a president to agree to.\n\nWas that essentially the spark to finally get this done after all the debate that you and congresswoman lee have led on this after all these years?\n\nKAINE: I would say, you know, Barbara has been a spark and I praised Todd Young, my Republican colleague. But I think the ingredient that really has been key is Joe Biden. And what I would say is Joe Biden`s confidence and his competence.\n\nNo one who has been president of the United States since LBJ has understood more the powers of the Article One branch, Congress, than Joe Biden. I mean, 36 years in the Senate, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and it takes an extremely self confident president to say, I want to inhabit any square centimeter of the Article Two powers, but I`m not threatened by a Congress inhabiting every square centimeter of the Article One powers.\n\nMost presidents feel threatened when Congress starts to exert some interest in war power issues. Joe Biden doesn`t feel threatened, he understands Congress has to be as vigorous in protective of Article One powers as the president is of Article Two powers.\n\nSo I think we will successfully repeal the zombie Iraq authorizations 1991 and 2002. My hope is by September, the 20th anniversary of the 2001 authorization to which war on non-state terrorist groups who attacked us, I think we will hopefully reach a handshake deal with the White House about the way to more narrowly described and to describe to the American public and provide limits on our actions against non state terrorist groups.\n\nAnd we`re working very closely with the White House. It`s just night and data have a White House that wants to work on this versus once that sees it as a threat to their own prerogatives.\n\nMADDOW: Right. Exactly, one who not only understands the constitutional prerogatives but isn`t insecure about them. It is amazing how much progress you can make once you drop that.\n\nVirginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine who has led and educated I think on this issue for so long, sir, this is a big step forward and I`m sure the next few days are going to be very interesting as it heads to the Senate. Keep us apprised. Thanks for helping us out tonight.\n\nKAINE: Thanks, Rachel. Good to talk to you.\n\nMADDOW: All right. Much more ahead here tonight. Stay with us.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nMADDOW: It`s basically one every ten people in the country. The total number of Americans who have health insurance because of the Affordable Care Act because of Obamacare clocks in at about 31 million people. Today, all 31 million people can breathe a sigh of relief because the Supreme Court this morning rejected a case brought by Republican led states that had asked the court to kill the Affordable Care Act altogether.\n\nThe courts said, no, they wouldn`t do that they left it in place. And in so doing they blocked what was conservatives` third effort at the Supreme Court to kill the bill. The Supreme Court first upheld the constitutionality of Obamacare nine years ago, that was a 5 to 4 ruling. Then six years ago, they upheld its constitutionality again, with a 6-3 ruling. Now today, even though the court has three justices appointed by President Trump, the ruling was even more lopsided, it was 7-2. It`s gone to 5-4, to 6-3, to 7-2.\n\nNow, the justices didn`t rule on the so-called merits of the case. They just ruled that the Republican officials in Texas and the other Republican states are suing did not have standing to bring the suit. But it does seem at least for now, that this fight is over. Republicans, of course, could keep trying. But I might recommend that they get a new hobby.\n\nThe majority opinion in the case today was written by the sort of center left Justice Stephen Breyer. Stephen Breyer`s name has been on a lot of headlines recently because he has been facing impassioned calls to step down from people who worry about a repeat of what happened in 2016 when Republicans blocked President Obama for failing to fill a seat. If the Senate is retaken by the Republicans, even with Joe Biden and the White House nominating somebody to fill Justice Breyer seat, nobody is confident that Joe Biden will be allowed to put his own nominee on the court.\n\nWe expect more than a dozen outstanding cases to be decided by the Supreme Court in three different days, they`re going to give rulings next week. But the biggest ruling of the term is now decided, this Affordable Care Act ruling today, an opinion written by the longest serving justice appointed by Democratic president.\n\nShould we expect news of significant terms of the ruling, or in terms of their makeup as a court?\n\nThere is nobody I`d rather talk to about all the above than Dahlia Lithwick. She writes about the courts and the law for \"Slate\". She hosts the excellent Slate podcast which is called \"Amicus\".\n\nDahlia, it`s great to see it. Thanks for joining us tonight.\n\nDAHLIA LITHWICK, SLATE: That time of year, Rachel. Good to see you.\n\nMADDOW: I know we`ve got three more days in which we are going to get more rulings next week. I think it`s Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. But the most consequential ruling we were waiting for was this one on the Affordable Care Act, right?\n\nLITHWICK: I think this one and probably Fulton when it came down today on the collision between religious liberties and civil rights and foster care in Philadelphia. That also was quite a narrow decision. So, I think you are right, it`s the one a lot of folks are holding their breath around.\n\nMADDOW: In terms of the closed court session as we look towards the end of next week, and the court issuing its rulings. A lot of people around the country are looking at the court and wondering if Justice Breyer is going to retire so he can leave on his own terms, and it gives not only the Democratic president but the Democratic-controlled -- narrowly Democratically controlled Senate a chance to replace him.\n\nWhat do you think of all the strum und drang around that?\n\nLITHWICK: It`s such a funny situation, Rachel, because the only person in the end who is the determinant of what he`s going to do is Stephen Breyer and he`s made clear time and again, including in an interview he gave me at Christmastime that he just doesn`t think that court justices are political, and that this is a political question, and it will retire when he wants to retire. But all of these swirling questions about we have a 50/50 Senate. We have Mitch McConnell announcing this week that he`s not going to ever confirm a Biden nominee if he gets control of the Senate. None of that seems to be part of Justice Breyer`s calculus.\n\nAnd I would say paradoxically, the more he`s pushed, there is a bunch of ads coming out in the next couple of days. A whole bunch of liberal scholars, 18 scholars signed a letter saying please get off the court. The more he is pushed, the more, in some sense, he is persuaded that this all looks really political, so he better stick around.\n\nMADDOW: In terms of how the court is operating right now. We`ve had some unusual splits in terms of the number of votes. I think people were surprised to see Justice Thomas on the side he came down today with the Affordable Care Act rolling even though it was decided on these narrow standing grounds.\n\nI wonder, I think people also read into the fact Justice Breyer wrote the opinion in the affordable care act that maybe that was a sign we should return to something in terms of what`s going on among the justices. Do you think those are tea leaves worth reading in terms of how the vote splits happen? How the sort of consensus effort is going led by the chief justice? Who is writing which opinions?\n\nI mean, we treat it like criminality but the thing that that stuff is worth watching, or not?\n\nLITHWICK: I mean, it`s worth watching, but I would be precise to say at the same moment this morning, a lot of court watchers were saying, John Roberts assigned the ACA case to Breyer. That means he`s telling Breyer you are done here, move on.\n\nThere were people saying John Roberts assigned the case to Breyer, that signals he is telling Breyer, stick around, the best is yet to come.\n\nSo, it`s not just criminology, it`s kind of a little bit reading into it what we want to see. I`m not sure what to make of the fact that chief justice assigned this to Breyer, but I think it`s probably the case that it`s just of a piece of this larger effort to say, why is it everybody except Steve Breyer wants him to retire? I think the more we push him, the more he digs in.\n\nMADDOW: I`m not pushing, I`m not pushing. I would never push. I`ve never pushed anything in my life. Why would I start pushing now?\n\nDahlia Lithwick who covers the courts for \"Slate\", she hosts the excellent \"Amicus\" podcast on \"Slate\". Dahlia, thank you as always. It`s always great to have you here.\n\nLITHWICK: Always a treat, thank you.\n\nMADDOW: All right. We`ll be right back. Stay with us.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nMADDOW: Senator Joe Manchin is the only Democrat in the U.S. Senate who saying he won`t support the big voting rights bill that Democrats and the Biden administration are pushing for. Senator Manchin says he won`t sign on to any bill expanding voting rights, or protecting voting rights, unless some Republicans agreed to vote for it as well.\n\nMitch McConnell, the leader in the senate, pledged zero Republican senators will vote for a voting rights bill no matter what. But Senator Manchin and effectively blamed Democrats for, that implying they are to blame for Republicans all saying no to it. They are to blame for crafting their voting rights bill in such a way that no Republicans felt like they could get behind it.\n\nInteresting development on this. Yesterday, rather than just continuing to say that, blaming his colleagues, Senator Manchin decided he would try to prove it. He decided to show his work on his theory. And he rode up a list of what he thought should go in a voting rights bill that he thought should get both Democratic and Republican support. It`s a very different set of proposals and what Democrats have put in their bill. As a bunch of stuff on it that things Republicans wanted Democrats really don`t.\n\nBut he is doing this to show that there is a way that he understands to write a voting bill that Republicans will vote for.\n\nEarlier this week, Senator Manchin tried to prove the point. He met with eight senators from the Republican side of the aisle, to pitch them on his so-called compromise voting rights plan.\n\nEven with all that, even with his everything I want and nothing I don`t offering, even with a personal working Republican senators on the other side of the aisle to get them to vote for his plan which he crafted specifically to appeal to them, look at what the Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said today about Joe Manchin`s new pitch. He said, quote, same rotten core. You see the headline there? McConnell rejects mentions voting rights compromise.\n\nSenator Manchin, you aren`t going to get the ten Republican senators you would need to vote for your voting rights compromise. Mitch McConnell just said it. He said zero Republicans will vote to defend voting rights in any way -- in any way, shape, or a watered down form.\n\nIf the country is going to have any action, and you depends on voting rights, it is going to have to be without any Republicans. That`s not just what critics of Senator Manchin have been saying. That`s what Senator Manchin has just proven with his bipartisan experiment, it`s maximalist bipartisan experiment on voting rights.\n\nSenator Manchin says defending the right to vote is a priority for him, but he`s now himself proven that there is only one path to get it, which is to change the Senate rules so that voting rights can be passed by Democrats alone. What next, Senator?\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nMADDOW: All right. That is going to do it for us here tonight. Thank you for bearing with us through some of our technical difficulties. I know the show sometimes looked a little caddie tonight. We will try to have it back on dry land by tomorrow.\n\nWe`ll see you again tomorrow night.\n\nNow, it`s time for \"THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O`DONNELL\".\n\nGood evening, Lawrence.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

(Photo by Russell Lee / Courtesy of the Library of Congress)\n\nEarlier this month, The Chicago Defender announced that it was publishing its final regular print issue. At first glance, it would appear to be the tragic end for another newspaper, another casualty of the decline of local print publications that a generation of journalists and citizens alike has had to endure. The owners of the Defender have argued that the best option for the paper to last for years to come is to go digital and join a growing number of former print newspapers in making the leap to online only. But the Chicago Defender 's unique place in American-and African American-history makes its loss particularly stinging. The Defender, in short, was one of the nation's premier African American print publications. Its loss is a symbol of the decline of African American media and the potential loss of other points of view in local, regional, and national media. The history of The Chicago Defender is a mirror of the larger history of the African American freedom struggle-the fight for civil, political, and human rights for African Americans in the United States. In the process, the Defender served as a venue for debates over how to achieve equality for African Americans. Publishing a dynamic array of prominent African Americans, from Langston Hughes to W.E.B. Du Bois, the Defender was often a champion of both desegregation and racial pride. Founded in 1905, the Defender was the brainchild of the lawyer and printer Robert S. Abbott. His newspaper became a critical organ of the city's exploding African American population, promoting as it did more African Americans to move from the South to Northern cities during what would be called the Great Migration. The Defender 's role in this migration is incalculable; the newspaper was shipped partly through railroad porters who traveled across the country. In addition, the long arc of African American history is difficult to think about without consulting the pages of The Chicago Defender , whose stories, read in retrospect, recount history from a distinctly African American point of view. Virtually all mainstream media in the United States at the turn of the 20th century viewed race relations strictly through the lens of the \"Negro problem,\" the phrase that many prominent Americans used to talk about the presence of African Americans in the country. As though the history of enslavement and the aborted process of Reconstruction were the fault of African Americans, media continued to view indications of \"backwardness\" from African Americans as proof of their racial inferiority. Newspapers, in fact, were important catalysts of anti-black race riots across the nation by spreading salacious and untrue stories about African American men sexually assaulting white women. A newsboy selling the Chicago Defender, 1942. (Photo by Jack Delano / Courtesy of the Library of Congress) The Defender not only provided information to the African American community but also often provided more accurate accounts of these riots, confrontations with the police, and other stories that in mainstream newspapers were yet more examples of the \"Negro problem.\" When the Chicago Race Riots of 1919 engulfed the city's largely African American South Side, Abbott used the Defender 's pages to urge African Americans to stay indoors. The newspaper, as a center of the community, was instrumental in ending the riots.

The newspaper was also critical to the growing link between African Americans and the Democratic Party during and after the rise of the New Deal coalition in the 1930s. As Ethan Michaeli recalled in his book on the Defender 's history, the newspaper was critical for Harry S. Truman's 1948 presidential campaign. \"Here was the clear confirmation of the national import of black political power, and The Defender' s essential role in galvanizing this essential electorate,\" Michaeli wrote about the newspaper's significance in getting out the African American vote in Chicago. T he Defender was both a chronicler of African American events and a shaper of them. The decision to publish the photos of the destroyed body of Emmett Till in his casket in 1955, for instance, helped galvanize African American public opinion around his death-a moment that pushed many young African Americans to join the growing civil rights movement of the 1950s and '60s. Jet magazine also published the photos, and in a sad coincidence, the same week the Defende r ceased printing, it was announced that the publisher of Jet (as well as Ebony , another historic African American magazine), Johnson Publishing Company, would put its photographic archives up for auction. African American-owned and -operated print media is at a crossroads, as is African American society in general. The ascendancy of Barack Obama may prove to have been a boon and high water mark for African American newspapers and magazines. The Defender had a front-row seat to the Chicago political machines that produced him as a viable statewide and eventually national candidate. It chronicled the rise of pivotal African American figures such as Jesse Jackson and Harold Washington and was there when Obama made his ill-fated run for Congress in 2000 (the only election campaign he ever lost). But what made the Defender different from its Chicago counterparts the Sun-Times and the Tribune was that the Defender presented a window into how African Americans saw their city and their place in it. The Defender served as a political clearinghouse for aspiring African American leaders, a nexus of social thought that allowed such leaders to reach a wide audience through the decades. With the Defender going digital and the rise of such websites as The Root , as well as the popularity of Desus and Mero, it is clear that the future of African American media in this country rests heavily on the Internet. But the mission of African American media-in an age of misinformation and so-called fake news-continues to be one of providing different voices talking about important stories of the day. In a story covering the paper's last print edition, the Defender reported an optimistic tone from its readers. Katara Patton, a writer for the paper, compared the Defender 's all-digital transition to music moving from cassette tapes to compact discs and then to streaming services. \"The same good music is available,\" she wrote. \"It is just in a different mode.\" With the need for African American media that is unafraid to talk about police brutality, economic inequality, and the continuing plague of white nationalism, the Defender and publications like it are as important as ever.\n\nThe history of The Chicago Defender is a mirror of the larger history of the African American freedom struggle-the fight for civil, political, and human rights for African Americans in the United States. In the process, the Defender served as a venue for debates over how to achieve equality for African Americans. Publishing a dynamic array of prominent African Americans, from Langston Hughes to W.E.B. Du Bois, the Defender was often a champion of both desegregation and racial pride. Founded in 1905, the Defender was the brainchild of the lawyer and printer Robert S. Abbott. His newspaper became a critical organ of the city's exploding African American population, promoting as it did more African Americans to move from the South to Northern cities during what would be called the Great Migration. The Defender 's role in this migration is incalculable; the newspaper was shipped partly through railroad porters who traveled across the country. In addition, the long arc of African American history is difficult to think about without consulting the pages of The Chicago Defender , whose stories, read in retrospect, recount history from a distinctly African American point of view. Virtually all mainstream media in the United States at the turn of the 20th century viewed race relations strictly through the lens of the \"Negro problem,\" the phrase that many prominent Americans used to talk about the presence of African Americans in the country. As though the history of enslavement and the aborted process of Reconstruction were the fault of African Americans, media continued to view indications of \"backwardness\" from African Americans as proof of their racial inferiority. Newspapers, in fact, were important catalysts of anti-black race riots across the nation by spreading salacious and untrue stories about African American men sexually assaulting white women.

(Photo by Jack Delano / Courtesy of the Library of Congress) The Defender not only provided information to the African American community but also often provided more accurate accounts of these riots, confrontations with the police, and other stories that in mainstream newspapers were yet more examples of the \"Negro problem.\" When the Chicago Race Riots of 1919 engulfed the city's largely African American South Side, Abbott used the Defender 's pages to urge African Americans to stay indoors. The newspaper, as a center of the community, was instrumental in ending the riots.

The newspaper was also critical to the growing link between African Americans and the Democratic Party during and after the rise of the New Deal coalition in the 1930s. As Ethan Michaeli recalled in his book on the Defender 's history, the newspaper was critical for Harry S. Truman's 1948 presidential campaign. \"Here was the clear confirmation of the national import of black political power, and The Defender' s essential role in galvanizing this essential electorate,\" Michaeli wrote about the newspaper's significance in getting out the African American vote in Chicago. T he Defender was both a chronicler of African American events and a shaper of them. The decision to publish the photos of the destroyed body of Emmett Till in his casket in 1955, for instance, helped galvanize African American public opinion around his death-a moment that pushed many young African Americans to join the growing civil rights movement of the 1950s and '60s.

Franklin Frazier writes that the Garvey movement is in a sense the black Ku Klux Klan. And he's not saying that perjoratively. The Garvey movement is a crowd movement essentially different from any other social phenomenon among Negroes. For the most part American Negroes have sought self-magnification in fraternal orders and the church. But these organizations have failed to give that support to the Negro's ego-consciousness which the white masses find in membership in a political community, or on a smaller scale in Kiwanis clubs and the Ku Klux Klan. In a certain sense Garvey's followers form the black Klan of America. The reason for Garvey's success in welding the Negroes into a crowd movement becomes apparent when we compare his methods and aims with those of other leaders. Take, for example, the leadership of Booker Washington. Washington could not be considered a leader of the masses of Negroes, for his program commended itself chiefly to white people and those Negroes who prided themselves on their opportunism. There was nothing popularly heroic or inspiring in his program to captivate the imagination of the average Negro. In fact the Negro was admonished to play an inglorious role. Certain other outstanding efforts among Negroes have failed to attract the masses because they have lacked the characteristics which have distinguished the Garvey movement. It is only necessary to mention such an organization as the National Urban League and its leadership to realize that so reasoned a program of social adjustment is lacking in everything that appeals to the crowd. The leadership of Dr. DuBois has been too intellectual to satisfy the mob. Even his glorification of the Negro has been in terms which escape the black masses. The PanAfrican Congress which he has promoted, while supporting to some extent the boasted aims of Garvey, has failed to stir any considerable number of American Negroes. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which has fought uncompromisingly for equality for the Negro, has never secured, except locally and occasionally, the support of the masses. It has lacked the dramatic element. The status of Negroes in American life makes it easy for a crowd movement to be initiated among them. In America the Negro is repressed and an outcast. Some people are inclined to feel that this repression is only felt by cultured Negroes. As a matter of fact many of them can find satisfaction in the intellectual and spiritual things of life and do not need the support to their personalities that the average man requires. The average Negro, like other mediocre people, must be fed upon empty and silly fictions in order that life may be bearable. In the South the most insignificant white man is made of supreme worth simply by the fact of his color, not to mention the added support he receives from the Kiwanis or the Klan.

Many American Negroes have belittled his influence on the ground that he is a West Indian. It has been said that Garvey was only able to attract the support of his fellow-countrymen. The truth is that Garvey aroused the Negroes of Georgia as much as those of New York, except where the black preacher discouraged anything that threatened his income, or where white domination smothered every earthly hope. Moreover, this prejudice against the West Indian Negro loses sight of the contribution of the West Indian to the American Negro. The West Indian who has been ruled by a small minority instead of being oppressed by the majority, is more worldly in his outlook. He has been successful in business. He does not need the lodge, with its promise of an imposing funeral, or the church, with its hope of a heavenly abode as an escape from a sense of inferiority. By his example he has given the American Negro an earthly goal. Garvey went even further. He not only promised the despised Negro a paradise on earth, but he made the Negro an important person in his immediate environment. He invented honors and social distinctions and converted every social invention to his use in his effort to make his followers feel important. While everyone was not a \"Knight\" or \"Sir\" all his followers were \"Fellow-men of the Negro Race.\" Even more concrete distinctions were open to all. The women were organized into Black Cross Nurses, and the men became uniformed members of the vanguard of the Great African Army. A uniformed member of a Negro lodge paled in significance beside a soldier of the Army of Africa. A Negro might be a porter during the day, taking his orders from white men but he was an officer in the black army when it assembled at night in Liberty Hall. Many a Negro went about his work singing in his heart that he was a member of the great army marching to \"heights of achievements.\" And even in basing his program upon fantastic claims of empire, Garvey always impressed his followers that his promise was more realistic than that of those who wereconstantly arguing for the theoretical rights of the Negro. In the Negro World for October 18, 1924, he warned his followers that Those who try to ridicule the idea that America is a white man's country are going to find themselves sadly disappointed one of these days, homeless, shelterless, and unprovided for. Some of us do harp on our constitutional rights, which sounds reasonable in the righteous interpretation thereof, but we are forgetting that righteousness is alien to the world and that sin and materialism now triumph, and for material glory and honor and selfishness man will slay his brother. And in the knowledge of this, is the Negro still so foolish as to believe that the majority of other races are going to be so unfair and unjust to themselves as to yield to weaker peoples that which they themselves desire? And after all this is essentially what most Negroes believe in spite of the celebrated faith of the Negro in America. A closer examination of the ideals and symbols which Garvey always held up before his followers shows his mastery of the technique of creating and holding crowds. The Negro group becomes idealized. Therefore he declares he is as strongly against race-intermixture as a Ku Kluxer. He believes in a \"pure black race just as all self-respecting whites believe in a pure white race.\" According to Garvey, civilization is about to fall and the Negro is called upon \"to evolve a national ideal, based upon freedom, human liberty, and true democracy.\" The \"redemption of Africa\" is the regaining of a lost paradise. It is always almost at hand. This belief has served the same purpose as does the myth of the general strike in the syndicalist movement. Garvey, who is dealing with people imbued with religious feeling, endows the redemption of Africa with the mystery of the regeneration of mankind. He said on one occasion: \"No one knows when the hour of Africa's redemption cometh. It is in the wind. It is coming one day like a storm. It will be here. When that day comes, all Africa will stand together.\" Garvey gave the crowd that followed him victims to vent their hatred upon, just as the evangelist turns the hatred of his followers upon the Devil. Every rabble must find someone to blame for its woes. The Negro who is poor, ignorant, and weak naturally wants to place the blame on anything except his own incapacity. Therefore Garvey was always attributing the misfortunes of the Negro group to traitors and enemies. Although the identity of these \"traitors\" and \"enemies\" was often obscure, as a rule they turned out to be Negro intellectuals. The cause for such animosity against this class of Negroes is apparent when we remember that Garvey himself lacks formal education. Garvey who was well acquainted with the tremendous influence of religion in the life of the Negro, proved himself matchless in assimilating his own program to the religious experience of the Negro. Christmas, with its association of the lowly birth of Jesus, became symbolic of the Negro's birth among the nations of the world. Easter became the symbol of the resurrection of an oppressed and crucified race. Such naive symbolism easily kindled enthusiasm among his followers. At other times Garvey made his own situation appear similar to that of Jesus. Just as the Jews incited the Roman authorities against Jesus, other Negro leaders were making the United States authorities persecute him. Most discussions of the Garvey movement have been concerned with the feasibility of his schemes and the legal aspects of the charge which brought him finally to the Atlanta Federal Prison. It is idle to attempt to apply to the schemes that attract crowds the test of reasonableness. Even experience fails to teach a crowd anything, for the crowd satisfies its vanity and longing in the beliefs it holds.. Nor is it surprising to find Garvey's followers regarding his imprisonment at present as martyrdom for the cause he, represents, although the technical charge on which he was convicted is only indirectly related to his program. But Garvey has not failed to exploit his imprisonment. He knows that the average man is impressed if anyone suffers. Upon his arrest he gave out the- following statement: \"There has never been a movement where the Leader has not suffered for the Cause, and not received the ingratitude of the people. I, like the rest, am prepared for the consequence.\" As he entered the prison in Atlanta he sent a message to his followers which appeared in his paper, the Negro World , for February 14, 1925. He paints himself as a sufferer for his group and blames his lot on a group of plotters. In commending his wife to the care of his followers he says: \"All I have, I have given to you. I have sacrificed my home and my loving wife for you. I intrust her to your charge, to protect and defend in my absence. She is the bravest little woman I know.\" Such pathos he knew the mob could not resist, and the final word he sent to his supporters under the caption, \"If I Die in Atlanta,\" with its apocalyptic message, raises him above mortals. He bade them \"Look for me in the whirlwind or the storm, look for me all around you, for, with God's grace, I shall come and bring with me the countless millions of black slaves who have died in America and the West Indies and the millions in Africa to aid you in the fight for liberty, freedom, and life.\" Since his imprisonment Gafvey has continued to send his weekly message on the front of his paper to his followers warning them against their enemies and exhorting them to remain faithful to him in his suffering. It is uncritical to regard Garvey as a common swindler who has sought simply to enrich himself, when the evidence seems to place him among those so-called cranks who refuse to deal realistically with life. He has the distinction of initiating the first real mass movement among American Negroes.\n\nE. Franklin Frazier writes that the Garvey movement is in a sense the black Ku Klux Klan. And he's not saying that perjoratively. The Garvey movement is a crowd movement essentially different from any other social phenomenon among Negroes. For the most part American Negroes have sought self-magnification in fraternal orders and the church. But these organizations have failed to give that support to the Negro's ego-consciousness which the white masses find in membership in a political community, or on a smaller scale in Kiwanis clubs and the Ku Klux Klan. In a certain sense Garvey's followers form the black Klan of America. The reason for Garvey's success in welding the Negroes into a crowd movement becomes apparent when we compare his methods and aims with those of other leaders. Take, for example, the leadership of Booker Washington. Washington could not be considered a leader of the masses of Negroes, for his program commended itself chiefly to white people and those Negroes who prided themselves on their opportunism. There was nothing popularly heroic or inspiring in his program to captivate the imagination of the average Negro. In fact the Negro was admonished to play an inglorious role. Certain other outstanding efforts among Negroes have failed to attract the masses because they have lacked the characteristics which have distinguished the Garvey movement. It is only necessary to mention such an organization as the National Urban League and its leadership to realize that so reasoned a program of social adjustment is lacking in everything that appeals to the crowd. The leadership of Dr. DuBois has been too intellectual to satisfy the mob. Even his glorification of the Negro has been in terms which escape the black masses. The PanAfrican Congress which he has promoted, while supporting to some extent the boasted aims of Garvey, has failed to stir any considerable number of American Negroes. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which has fought uncompromisingly for equality for the Negro, has never secured, except locally and occasionally, the support of the masses. It has lacked the dramatic element. The status of Negroes in American life makes it easy for a crowd movement to be initiated among them. In America the Negro is repressed and an outcast. Some people are inclined to feel that this repression is only felt by cultured Negroes. As a matter of fact many of them can find satisfaction in the intellectual and spiritual things of life and do not need the support to their personalities that the average man requires. The average Negro, like other mediocre people, must be fed upon empty and silly fictions in order that life may be bearable. In the South the most insignificant white man is made of supreme worth simply by the fact of his color, not to mention the added support he receives from the Kiwanis or the Klan.

Many American Negroes have belittled his influence on the ground that he is a West Indian. It has been said that Garvey was only able to attract the support of his fellow-countrymen. The truth is that Garvey aroused the Negroes of Georgia as much as those of New York, except where the black preacher discouraged anything that threatened his income, or where white domination smothered every earthly hope. Moreover, this prejudice against the West Indian Negro loses sight of the contribution of the West Indian to the American Negro. The West Indian who has been ruled by a small minority instead of being oppressed by the majority, is more worldly in his outlook. He has been successful in business. He does not need the lodge, with its promise of an imposing funeral, or the church, with its hope of a heavenly abode as an escape from a sense of inferiority. By his example he has given the American Negro an earthly goal. Garvey went even further. He not only promised the despised Negro a paradise on earth, but he made the Negro an important person in his immediate environment. He invented honors and social distinctions and converted every social invention to his use in his effort to make his followers feel important. While everyone was not a \"Knight\" or \"Sir\" all his followers were \"Fellow-men of the Negro Race.\" Even more concrete distinctions were open to all. The women were organized into Black Cross Nurses, and the men became uniformed members of the vanguard of the Great African Army. A uniformed member of a Negro lodge paled in significance beside a soldier of the Army of Africa. A Negro might be a porter during the day, taking his orders from white men but he was an officer in the black army when it assembled at night in Liberty Hall.

Garvey who was well acquainted with the tremendous influence of religion in the life of the Negro, proved himself matchless in assimilating his own program to the religious experience of the Negro. Christmas, with its association of the lowly birth of Jesus, became symbolic of the Negro's birth among the nations of the world. Easter became the symbol of the resurrection of an oppressed and crucified race. Such naive symbolism easily kindled enthusiasm among his followers. At other times Garvey made his own situation appear similar to that of Jesus. Just as the Jews incited the Roman authorities against Jesus, other Negro leaders were making the United States authorities persecute him. Most discussions of the Garvey movement have been concerned with the feasibility of his schemes and the legal aspects of the charge which brought him finally to the Atlanta Federal Prison. It is idle to attempt to apply to the schemes that attract crowds the test of reasonableness. Even experience fails to teach a crowd anything, for the crowd satisfies its vanity and longing in the beliefs it holds.. Nor is it surprising to find Garvey's followers regarding his imprisonment at present as martyrdom for the cause he, represents, although the technical charge on which he was convicted is only indirectly related to his program. But Garvey has not failed to exploit his imprisonment. He knows that the average man is impressed if anyone suffers. Upon his arrest he gave out the- following statement: \"There has never been a movement where the Leader has not suffered for the Cause, and not received the ingratitude of the people. I, like the rest, am prepared for the consequence.\" As he entered the prison in Atlanta he sent a message to his followers which appeared in his paper, the Negro World , for February 14, 1925. He paints himself as a sufferer for his group and blames his lot on a group of plotters. In commending his wife to the care of his followers he says: \"All I have, I have given to you. I have sacrificed my home and my loving wife for you. I intrust her to your charge, to protect and defend in my absence. She is the bravest little woman I know.\" Such pathos he knew the mob could not resist, and the final word he sent to his supporters under the caption, \"If I Die in Atlanta,\" with its apocalyptic message, raises him above mortals. He bade them \"Look for me in the whirlwind or the storm, look for me all around you, for, with God's grace, I shall come and bring with me the countless millions of black slaves who have died in America and the West Indies and the millions in Africa to aid you in the fight for liberty, freedom, and life.\" Since his imprisonment Gafvey has continued to send his weekly message on the front of his paper to his followers warning them against their enemies and exhorting them to remain faithful to him in his suffering. It is uncritical to regard Garvey as a common swindler who has sought simply to enrich himself, when the evidence seems to place him among those so-called cranks who refuse to deal realistically with life. He has the distinction of initiating the first real mass movement among American Negroes.\n\nThe status of Negroes in American life makes it easy for a crowd movement to be initiated among them. In America the Negro is repressed and an outcast. Some people are inclined to feel that this repression is only felt by cultured Negroes. As a matter of fact many of them can find satisfaction in the intellectual and spiritual things of life and do not need the support to their personalities that the average man requires. The average Negro, like other mediocre people, must be fed upon empty and silly fictions in order that life may be bearable. In the South the most insignificant white man is made of supreme worth simply by the fact of his color, not to mention the added support he receives from the Kiwanis or the Klan.

Many American Negroes have belittled his influence on the ground that he is a West Indian. It has been said that Garvey was only able to attract the support of his fellow-countrymen. The truth is that Garvey aroused the Negroes of Georgia as much as those of New York, except where the black preacher discouraged anything that threatened his income, or where white domination smothered every earthly hope. Moreover, this prejudice against the West Indian Negro loses sight of the contribution of the West Indian to the American Negro. The West Indian who has been ruled by a small minority instead of being oppressed by the majority, is more worldly in his outlook. He has been successful in business. He does not need the lodge, with its promise of an imposing funeral, or the church, with its hope of a heavenly abode as an escape from a sense of inferiority. By his example he has given the American Negro an earthly goal. Garvey went even further. He not only promised the despised Negro a paradise on earth, but he made the Negro an important person in his immediate environment. He invented honors and social distinctions and converted every social invention to his use in his effort to make his followers feel important. While everyone was not a \"Knight\" or \"Sir\" all his followers were \"Fellow-men of the Negro Race.\" Even more concrete distinctions were open to all. The women were organized into Black Cross Nurses, and the men became uniformed members of the vanguard of the Great African Army. A uniformed member of a Negro lodge paled in significance beside a soldier of the Army of Africa. A Negro might be a porter during the day, taking his orders from white men but he was an officer in the black army when it assembled at night in Liberty Hall. Many a Negro went about his work singing in his heart that he was a member of the great army marching to \"heights of achievements.\" And even in basing his program upon fantastic claims of empire, Garvey always impressed his followers that his promise was more realistic than that of those who wereconstantly arguing for the theoretical rights of the Negro. In the Negro World for October 18, 1924, he warned his followers that Those who try to ridicule the idea that America is a white man's country are going to find themselves sadly disappointed one of these days, homeless, shelterless, and unprovided for. Some of us do harp on our constitutional rights, which sounds reasonable in the righteous interpretation thereof, but we are forgetting that righteousness is alien to the world and that sin and materialism now triumph, and for material glory and honor and selfishness man will slay his brother. And in the knowledge of this, is the Negro still so foolish as to believe that the majority of other races are going to be so unfair and unjust to themselves as to yield to weaker peoples that which they themselves desire? And after all this is essentially what most Negroes believe in spite of the celebrated faith of the Negro in America. A closer examination of the ideals and symbols which Garvey always held up before his followers shows his mastery of the technique of creating and holding crowds. The Negro group becomes idealized. Therefore he declares he is as strongly against race-intermixture as a Ku Kluxer. He believes in a \"pure black race just as all self-respecting whites believe in a pure white race.\" According to Garvey, civilization is about to fall and the Negro is called upon \"to evolve a national ideal, based upon freedom, human liberty, and true democracy.\" The \"redemption of Africa\" is the regaining of a lost paradise. It is always almost at hand. This belief has served the same purpose as does the myth of the general strike in the syndicalist movement. Garvey, who is dealing with people imbued with religious feeling, endows the redemption of Africa with the mystery of the regeneration of mankind. He said on one occasion: \"No one knows when the hour of Africa's redemption cometh. It is in the wind. It is coming one day like a storm. It will be here. When that day comes, all Africa will stand together.\" Garvey gave the crowd that followed him victims to vent their hatred upon, just as the evangelist turns the hatred of his followers upon the Devil. Every rabble must find someone to blame for its woes. The Negro who is poor, ignorant, and weak naturally wants to place the blame on anything except his own incapacity. Therefore Garvey was always attributing the misfortunes of the Negro group to traitors and enemies. Although the identity of these \"traitors\" and \"enemies\" was often obscure, as a rule they turned out to be Negro intellectuals.

I have sacrificed my home and my loving wife for you. I intrust her to your charge, to protect and defend in my absence. She is the bravest little woman I know.\" Such pathos he knew the mob could not resist, and the final word he sent to his supporters under the caption, \"If I Die in Atlanta,\" with its apocalyptic message, raises him above mortals. He bade them \"Look for me in the whirlwind or the storm, look for me all around you, for, with God's grace, I shall come and bring with me the countless millions of black slaves who have died in America and the West Indies and the millions in Africa to aid you in the fight for liberty, freedom, and life.\" Since his imprisonment Gafvey has continued to send his weekly message on the front of his paper to his followers warning them against their enemies and exhorting them to remain faithful to him in his suffering. It is uncritical to regard Garvey as a common swindler who has sought simply to enrich himself, when the evidence seems to place him among those so-called cranks who refuse to deal realistically with life. He has the distinction of initiating the first real mass movement among American Negroes.\n\nA closer examination of the ideals and symbols which Garvey always held up before his followers shows his mastery of the technique of creating and holding crowds. The Negro group becomes idealized. Therefore he declares he is as strongly against race-intermixture as a Ku Kluxer. He believes in a \"pure black race just as all self-respecting whites believe in a pure white race.\" According to Garvey, civilization is about to fall and the Negro is called upon \"to evolve a national ideal, based upon freedom, human liberty, and true democracy.\" The \"redemption of Africa\" is the regaining of a lost paradise. It is always almost at hand. This belief has served the same purpose as does the myth of the general strike in the syndicalist movement. Garvey, who is dealing with people imbued with religious feeling, endows the redemption of Africa with the mystery of the regeneration of mankind. He said on one occasion: \"No one knows when the hour of Africa's redemption cometh. It is in the wind. It is coming one day like a storm. It will be here. When that day comes, all Africa will stand together.\" Garvey gave the crowd that followed him victims to vent their hatred upon, just as the evangelist turns the hatred of his followers upon the Devil. Every rabble must find someone to blame for its woes. The Negro who is poor, ignorant, and weak naturally wants to place the blame on anything except his own incapacity. Therefore Garvey was always attributing the misfortunes of the Negro group to traitors and enemies. Although the identity of these \"traitors\" and \"enemies\" was often obscure, as a rule they turned out to be Negro intellectuals. The cause for such animosity against this class of Negroes is apparent when we remember that Garvey himself lacks formal education. Garvey who was well acquainted with the tremendous influence of religion in the life of the Negro, proved himself matchless in assimilating his own program to the religious experience of the Negro. Christmas, with its association of the lowly birth of Jesus, became symbolic of the Negro's birth among the nations of the world. Easter became the symbol of the resurrection of an oppressed and crucified race. Such naive symbolism easily kindled enthusiasm among his followers. At other times Garvey made his own situation appear similar to that of Jesus. Just as the Jews incited the Roman authorities against Jesus, other Negro leaders were making the United States authorities persecute him. Most discussions of the Garvey movement have been concerned with the feasibility of his schemes and the legal aspects of the charge which brought him finally to the Atlanta Federal Prison. It is idle to attempt to apply to the schemes that attract crowds the test of reasonableness. Even experience fails to teach a crowd anything, for the crowd satisfies its vanity and longing in the beliefs it holds.. Nor is it surprising to find Garvey's followers regarding his imprisonment at present as martyrdom for the cause he, represents, although the technical charge on which he was convicted is only indirectly related to his program. But Garvey has not failed to exploit his imprisonment. He knows that the average man is impressed if anyone suffers. Upon his arrest he gave out the- following statement: \"There has never been a movement where the Leader has not suffered for the Cause, and not received the ingratitude of the people.

What's telling, though, is how hard the right is fighting back against critics attacking the outrageous \"personal benefit\" claim. Governor Ron DeSantis, who likes to brag about his \"Stop WOKE\" education bill, seemed at first to distance himself, perhaps because his presidential bid is circling the drain at least partly because voters are repelled by his culture-war histrionics. DeSantis literally snorted when asked about Vice President Kamala Harris's claim that the Florida guidelines \"want to replace history with lies,\" then quickly added, \"I wasn't involved,\" crediting his handpicked, all-white Florida Board of Education. But he leaned into the claim nonetheless. \"They're probably going to show that some of the folks that eventually parlayed, you know, being a blacksmith into doing things later in life. But the reality is, all of that is rooted in whatever is factual.\" You know? No, I don't know, governor, and neither does anyone else. \"Parlayed\" is a particularly cruel world. The enslaved didn't have the power to \"parlay\" any skills they may have acquired into opportunity; they were property, not entrepreneurs. The Washington Post 's Eugene Robinson refuted DeSantis's claim with his own enslaved great-great-grandfather's history: He did, in fact, work as a blacksmith. \"But he had no ability to 'parlay' anything, because his time and labor were not his own,\" Robinson wrote. \"They belonged to his enslaver. He belonged to his enslaver.\" He was sold, like a piece of livestock, at least twice. Related Article Ron DeSantis Is Starting to Look Like a Scott Walker-Level Loser John Nichols In fact, the Tampa Bay Times found that of the 16 examples the state produced of formerly enslaved people \"parlaying\" their master-taught skills into jobs later in life, few fit that description. They were either already free Black people, or they learned skills after escaping slavery, or they never were slaves at all. My favorite: Betty Washington Lewis, who was never a slave but was President George Washington's younger sister, who herself owned slaves. Another prominent example: educator Booker T. Washington. But Washington became free as a child, and worked numerous jobs to put himself through school. The paper also revealed that the leader of the group that wrote the guidelines is the head of the National Black Republican Association.

The right is particularly incensed that Harris went to Florida on Friday to excoriate the standards personally. All day Monday, the network covered National Review writer Charles C.W. Cooke's jeremiad against the vice president, headlined \"Kamala Harris Is Brazenly Lying About Florida's Slavery Curriculum.\" Someone might have warned Cooke that \"brazen\" is a particularly gendered term of insult, going back to Jezebel, but I doubt he would care. Cooke has made a niche for himself mocking Harris, for \"vapidity\" and her voice, but she really enraged him with her attack on Florida's slavery curriculum as a form of \"gaslighting.\" \"This is a brazen lie,\" Cooke huffed. \"It's an astonishing lie. It's an evil lie. It is so untrue-so deliberately and cynically misleading-that, in a sensible political culture, Harris would be obligated to issue an apology.\" Cooke's proof for his hysterical claims? That some of the other 190 facts outlined in the curriculum in fact discuss the violence and cruelty of slavery. But he doesn't say anything's wrong with the \"personal benefits\" claim-in fact, he terms it \"correct.\" Current Issue View our current issue At regular intervals on Monday, Fox featured a chyron denouncing Harris's \"evil lie.\" Noted historian Jesse Watters-OK, kidding, he's the goofball who succeeded Tucker Carlson when the disgraced host was fired-declared pompously: \"This is historical fact, that slaves did develop skills while they were enslaved and then used those skills as blacksmiths, in agriculture, tailoring, in the shipping business, to benefit themselves and their families.\" S o what's the truth? It's not that Harris is an evil liar, that much we know. Slavery has long been presented, by its defenders, as somehow of \"benefit\" to the enslaved. In 1837, notorious pro-slavery South Carolina Senator John Calhoun (himself a former vice president) gave a famous speech, \" Slavery a Positive Good ,\" in which he declared, \"Never before has the black race of Central Africa, from the dawn of history to the present day, attained a condition so civilized and so improved, not only physically, but morally and intellectually.\" (Department of self promotion: That quote, and others like it, comes from a new book I've coauthored with Nick Hanauer and Donald Cohen, Corporate Bullsh*t: Exposing the Lies and Half-Truths That Protect Profit, Power and Wealth in America , which will be published by The New Press in September. You can preorder it here .) While the Florida guidelines emphasize the teaching of \"the trades of slaves (e.g., musicians, healers, blacksmiths, carpenters, shoemakers, weavers, tailors, sawyers, hostlers, silversmiths, cobblers, wheelwrights, wigmakers, milliners, painters, coopers),\" almost \"all of [Florida's] slaves (98 percent) were involved in agricultural labor,\" according to a 2010 article in Florida Humanities magazine, most of which was not skill-building but back-breaking. The guidelines also ignore the fact that many enslaved Africans arrived on these shores with advanced skills of their own. \"They already knew how to measure, irrigate, sail, forge, read, write, translate, mine, weave, build, cook, harvest, heal and create,\" The Washington Post 's Gillian Brockell writes . Slave-traders from various Southern states actually traveled to different parts of Africa to target cultures where residents had skills that could advance local plantations. There is, predictably, a lot of false equivalence in the rest of the guidelines. Teachers are to explore \"acts of violence perpetrated against and by African Americans\" (emphasis added), listing a handful of race riots that were clearly instigated by whites, in which almost all victims were black. There are multiple \"teachings\" devoted to the fact that \"slavery was utilized in Asian, European, and African cultures,\" \"among indigenous peoples of the Americas,\" while emphasizing \"systematic slave trading in Africa.\" The guidelines claim that the first Africans on these shores came, like white laborers, as \"indentured servants.\" There's debate over that claim: We know that slave codes from the early 17th century made clear that whites could earn their freedom, customarily after seven years, but Blacks never could. The takeaway from the Florida guidelines is that every culture enslaved people at some point, that Africans enslaved other Africans, that whites have at times been enslaved, that Indigenous Americans practiced slavery before Europeans even got here-all the while playing down the peculiarly rigid, race-based, intergenerational, and violence-enforced institution that emerged in the United States. \"Taken together,\" historian Heather Cox Richardson concludes , \"this curriculum presents human enslavement as simply one of a number of labor systems, a system that does not, in this telling, involve racism or violence.\" It also attributes, she notes, the uneven movement from enslavement to freedom, still not complete, to \"the principles contained in foundational documents,\" while promoting the notion that \"liberty and economic freedom generate broad-based opportunity and prosperity in the United States.\" It emphasizes the actions of white abolitionists and political leaders over the resistance of Black people themselves. Again, the guidelines aren't uniformly wrong or twisted. But they feature so many distortions and omissions that consulting the entire document, as National Review 's Cooke demands, shows that highlighting the alleged \"personal benefits\" that some of the enslaved allegedly derived from slavery isn't cherry-picking one measly tin-eared statement, but pointing to a tapestry of indoctrination designed to make American slavery seem less uniquely brutal than it was. The bottom line of DeSantis's \" Stop Woke Act \" is to squash all teaching on race that might lead a white child to believe she or he \"bears personal responsibility for and must feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress.\" That's the highest priority of many of these measures, in other states too: In South Carolina , students got Ta-Nehisi Coates's Between the World And Me banned from their Advanced Placement language course because, in the words of one, \"I actually felt ashamed to be Caucasian.\" Of course we can't have that, especially in the South. That's why Florida will now teach a sanitized version of Black history, showing that while slavery was, OK, not good; it was practiced widely; it provided some benefits to its victims; and it was unraveled largely by the principles handed down by the American founders, many of whom either supported slavery or owned slaves themselves. And hey, if everybody did it, why should white Americans feel bad about it? DeSantis almost makes me ashamed to be Caucasian.\n\nWhat's telling, though, is how hard the right is fighting back against critics attacking the outrageous \"personal benefit\" claim.

It's not that Harris is an evil liar, that much we know. Slavery has long been presented, by its defenders, as somehow of \"benefit\" to the enslaved.

While the Florida guidelines emphasize the teaching of \"the trades of slaves (e.g., musicians, healers, blacksmiths, carpenters, shoemakers, weavers, tailors, sawyers, hostlers, silversmiths, cobblers, wheelwrights, wigmakers, milliners, painters, coopers),\" almost \"all of [Florida's] slaves (98 percent) were involved in agricultural labor,\" according to a 2010 article in Florida Humanities magazine, most of which was not skill-building but back-breaking. The guidelines also ignore the fact that many enslaved Africans arrived on these shores with advanced skills of their own. \"They already knew how to measure, irrigate, sail, forge, read, write, translate, mine, weave, build, cook, harvest, heal and create,\" The Washington Post 's Gillian Brockell writes . Slave-traders from various Southern states actually traveled to different parts of Africa to target cultures where residents had skills that could advance local plantations. There is, predictably, a lot of false equivalence in the rest of the guidelines. Teachers are to explore \"acts of violence perpetrated against and by African Americans\" (emphasis added), listing a handful of race riots that were clearly instigated by whites, in which almost all victims were black. There are multiple \"teachings\" devoted to the fact that \"slavery was utilized in Asian, European, and African cultures,\" \"among indigenous peoples of the Americas,\" while emphasizing \"systematic slave trading in Africa.\" The guidelines claim that the first Africans on these shores came, like white laborers, as \"indentured servants.\" There's debate over that claim: We know that slave codes from the early 17th century made clear that whites could earn their freedom, customarily after seven years, but Blacks never could. The takeaway from the Florida guidelines is that every culture enslaved people at some point, that Africans enslaved other Africans, that whites have at times been enslaved, that Indigenous Americans practiced slavery before Europeans even got here-all the while playing down the peculiarly rigid, race-based, intergenerational, and violence-enforced institution that emerged in the United States. \"Taken together,\" historian Heather Cox Richardson concludes , \"this curriculum presents human enslavement as simply one of a number of labor systems, a system that does not, in this telling, involve racism or violence.\" It also attributes, she notes, the uneven movement from enslavement to freedom, still not complete, to \"the principles contained in foundational documents,\" while promoting the notion that \"liberty and economic freedom generate broad-based opportunity and prosperity in the United States.\" It emphasizes the actions of white abolitionists and political leaders over the resistance of Black people themselves. Again, the guidelines aren't uniformly wrong or twisted. But they feature so many distortions and omissions that consulting the entire document, as National Review 's Cooke demands, shows that highlighting the alleged \"personal benefits\" that some of the enslaved allegedly derived from slavery isn't cherry-picking one measly tin-eared statement, but pointing to a tapestry of indoctrination designed to make American slavery seem less uniquely brutal than it was. The bottom line of DeSantis's \" Stop Woke Act \" is to squash all teaching on race that might lead a white child to believe she or he \"bears personal responsibility for and must feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress.\" That's the highest priority of many of these measures, in other states too: In South Carolina , students got Ta-Nehisi Coates's Between the World And Me banned from their Advanced Placement language course because, in the words of one, \"I actually felt ashamed to be Caucasian.\" Of course we can't have that, especially in the South. That's why Florida will now teach a sanitized version of Black history, showing that while slavery was, OK, not good; it was practiced widely; it provided some benefits to its victims; and it was unraveled largely by the principles handed down by the American founders, many of whom either supported slavery or owned slaves themselves. And hey, if everybody did it, why should white Americans feel bad about it? DeSantis almost makes me ashamed to be Caucasian.\n\nDeSantis literally snorted when asked about Vice President Kamala Harris's claim that the Florida guidelines \"want to replace history with lies,\" then quickly added, \"I wasn't involved,\" crediting his handpicked, all-white Florida Board of Education. But he leaned into the claim nonetheless. \"They're probably going to show that some of the folks that eventually parlayed, you know, being a blacksmith into doing things later in life. But the reality is, all of that is rooted in whatever is factual.\" You know? No, I don't know, governor, and neither does anyone else. \"Parlayed\" is a particularly cruel world. The enslaved didn't have the power to \"parlay\" any skills they may have acquired into opportunity; they were property, not entrepreneurs. The Washington Post 's Eugene Robinson refuted DeSantis's claim with his own enslaved great-great-grandfather's history: He did, in fact, work as a blacksmith. \"But he had no ability to 'parlay' anything, because his time and labor were not his own,\" Robinson wrote. \"They belonged to his enslaver. He belonged to his enslaver.\" He was sold, like a piece of livestock, at least twice.

My favorite: Betty Washington Lewis, who was never a slave but was President George Washington's younger sister, who herself owned slaves. Another prominent example: educator Booker T. Washington.

It's not that Harris is an evil liar, that much we know. Slavery has long been presented, by its defenders, as somehow of \"benefit\" to the enslaved. In 1837, notorious pro-slavery South Carolina Senator John Calhoun (himself a former vice president) gave a famous speech, \" Slavery a Positive Good ,\" in which he declared, \"Never before has the black race of Central Africa, from the dawn of history to the present day, attained a condition so civilized and so improved, not only physically, but morally and intellectually.\" (Department of self promotion: That quote, and others like it, comes from a new book I've coauthored with Nick Hanauer and Donald Cohen, Corporate Bullsh*t: Exposing the Lies and Half-Truths That Protect Profit, Power and Wealth in America , which will be published by The New Press in September.

While the Florida guidelines emphasize the teaching of \"the trades of slaves (e.g., musicians, healers, blacksmiths, carpenters, shoemakers, weavers, tailors, sawyers, hostlers, silversmiths, cobblers, wheelwrights, wigmakers, milliners, painters, coopers),\" almost \"all of [Florida's] slaves (98 percent) were involved in agricultural labor,\" according to a 2010 article in Florida Humanities magazine, most of which was not skill-building but back-breaking. The guidelines also ignore the fact that many enslaved Africans arrived on these shores with advanced skills of their own. \"They already knew how to measure, irrigate, sail, forge, read, write, translate, mine, weave, build, cook, harvest, heal and create,\" The Washington Post 's Gillian Brockell writes . Slave-traders from various Southern states actually traveled to different parts of Africa to target cultures where residents had skills that could advance local plantations. There is, predictably, a lot of false equivalence in the rest of the guidelines. Teachers are to explore \"acts of violence perpetrated against and by African Americans\" (emphasis added), listing a handful of race riots that were clearly instigated by whites, in which almost all victims were black. There are multiple \"teachings\" devoted to the fact that \"slavery was utilized in Asian, European, and African cultures,\" \"among indigenous peoples of the Americas,\" while emphasizing \"systematic slave trading in Africa.\" The guidelines claim that the first Africans on these shores came, like white laborers, as \"indentured servants.\" There's debate over that claim: We know that slave codes from the early 17th century made clear that whites could earn their freedom, customarily after seven years, but Blacks never could. The takeaway from the Florida guidelines is that every culture enslaved people at some point, that Africans enslaved other Africans, that whites have at times been enslaved, that Indigenous Americans practiced slavery before Europeans even got here-all the while playing down the peculiarly rigid, race-based, intergenerational, and violence-enforced institution that emerged in the United States. \"Taken together,\" historian Heather Cox Richardson concludes , \"this curriculum presents human enslavement as simply one of a number of labor systems, a system that does not, in this telling, involve racism or violence.\" It also attributes, she notes, the uneven movement from enslavement to freedom, still not complete, to \"the principles contained in foundational documents,\" while promoting the notion that \"liberty and economic freedom generate broad-based opportunity and prosperity in the United States.\" It emphasizes the actions of white abolitionists and political leaders over the resistance of Black people themselves. Again, the guidelines aren't uniformly wrong or twisted. But they feature so many distortions and omissions that consulting the entire document, as National Review 's Cooke demands, shows that highlighting the alleged \"personal benefits\" that some of the enslaved allegedly derived from slavery isn't cherry-picking one measly tin-eared statement, but pointing to a tapestry of indoctrination designed to make American slavery seem less uniquely brutal than it was. The bottom line of DeSantis's \" Stop Woke Act \" is to squash all teaching on race that might lead a white child to believe she or he \"bears personal responsibility for and must feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress.\" That's the highest priority of many of these measures, in other states too: In South Carolina , students got Ta-Nehisi Coates's Between the World And Me banned from their Advanced Placement language course because, in the words of one, \"I actually felt ashamed to be Caucasian.\" Of course we can't have that, especially in the South. That's why Florida will now teach a sanitized version of Black history, showing that while slavery was, OK, not good; it was practiced widely; it provided some benefits to its victims; and it was unraveled largely by the principles handed down by the American founders, many of whom either supported slavery or owned slaves themselves.

But they feature so many distortions and omissions that consulting the entire document, as National Review 's Cooke demands, shows that highlighting the alleged \"personal benefits\" that some of the enslaved allegedly derived from slavery isn't cherry-picking one measly tin-eared statement, but pointing to a tapestry of indoctrination designed to make American slavery seem less uniquely brutal than it was. The bottom line of DeSantis's \" Stop Woke Act \" is to squash all teaching on race that might lead a white child to believe she or he \"bears personal responsibility for and must feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress.\" That's the highest priority of many of these measures, in other states too: In South Carolina , students got Ta-Nehisi Coates's Between the World And Me banned from their Advanced Placement language course because, in the words of one, \"I actually felt ashamed to be Caucasian.\" Of course we can't have that, especially in the South.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

He's a white man who hasn't sent mean tweets to Republican lawmakers, which should make him palatable enough for Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. He's even likely to pick up some Republican votes: He's an eminently qualified lawyer with an affable and inoffensive nature. The dude even got choked up during his hearing when speaking about how the country welcomed his grandparents from Europe, protecting them from anti-Semitism, and explained that being the attorney general would be the \"highest, best use\" of his skills to \"pay the country back.\" After finishing a pointed line of questioning, Republican senator and faux-folksy Rhodes Scholar John Kennedy let slip, \"I think you'll make a fine attorney general\" before he cut his mic. He's getting confirmed. I tend to think of the attorney general as the most important cabinet appointment (come at me, State Department bros), and Biden nominated a guy who will be confirmed in a bipartisan walk. It's a victory for the new administration, but it's a victory that rests on the banality of whiteness. Garland's status as a white man seems to be insulating him from the thing Republicans really want to do, which is to make it difficult for people of color to be in charge of the law. Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, even members of the Sedition Caucus, didn't have anything they could use to poke holes in Garland's flawless résumé or anodyne public profile. So instead, they directed their attacks at the two women of color Biden has nominated to join Garland at the Justice Department: Vanita Gupta (nominated as associate attorney general) and Kristen Clarke (nominated to head the Civil Rights Division). Senator Mike Lee did most of the hatchet work at the hearing. He asked Garland about statements attributed to Gupta and Clarke in the past: For Gupta, it was over her opposition to the confirmation of alleged attempted rapist Brett Kavanaugh; for Clarke, he had to go all the way back to her college career to drum up allegations of anti-Semitism and find an article she published that Republicans claim advocated for the \"superiority\" of the Black race over white people. Lee didn't have any heat for Lisa Monaco, who has been nominated to be deputy attorney general, but is white. It has become de rigueur for Republicans to allege or imply that Black civil rights activists, like Clarke, are secretly anti-Semitic. Clarke was the head of a campus organization at Harvard that invited Tony Martin, an anti-Semitic author, to speak out against Charles Murray's The Bell Curve . Clarke was 19 at the time, and she has said she made a mistake. Perhaps if Clarke had tried to rape Martin, instead of inviting him as a speaker, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee would accept her apology for her youthful error. As it is, accusing Black people of anti-Semitism is just what they do now, while ignoring the actual anti-Semites in their party who march and commit hate crimes and come up with limericks about replacement theory .

He didn't have to. \"That doesn't sound like a question for me, Senator\" would have been a perfectly acceptable non-answer to the filthy questions posed by Lee. I guess when Republicans make you wait five years to get a hearing, it makes you less inclined to let their crap slide. But the Republican long game isn't just to trash the specific appointments of Gupta and Clarke, both of whom are as qualified as Garland is for the top job at the Justice Department, and more than qualified for the positions to which they've been nominated. Their goal is to delegitimize the quest for social and racial justice and accuse anybody who strives for equality under the law to be harboring anti-white (which to them means \"anti-American\") views. Lee rounded out his questioning by asking Garland to give \"assurances\" that Garland's DOJ would protect religious people, as if it's the attorney general's job to make discrimination against the LGBTQ community constitutional if people claim Jesus made them do it. Ted Cruz wasted all his time criticizing the \"politicization and weaponization\" of the Justice Department under (wait for it) Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch. Presumably, Cruz was in Cancún during the tenures of Jeff Sessions and Bill Barr. Kennedy asked Garland to explain \"systemic racism\" and \"implicit bias\" in a truly bizarre set of questions that seemed almost like he was trying to bait Garland into calling him a racist. And Tom Cotton asked : \"Are you aware President Biden has signed an executive order stating his administration will affirmatively advance racial equity, not racial equality but racial equity?\" Those two words mean the same thing, but clearly Cotton wanted the white people listening to think there is a difference. One thing I find curious about the most openly racist people in our society is that they are sure the real goal of racial justice is to treat white people like Black people have been treated, as opposed to the stated and logical goal of treating Black people like people-people, which is something this country has still never tried. Republicans like Cotton are truly only ever able to see racial equality as a zero-sum game: One race always has to be preferred over all others, in his mind. It's why Cotton will always fail. Garland gave the \"right\" answers to all of these questions. He said he didn't see a difference between \"equality\" and \"equity.\" He wouldn't comment about Holder or Lynch. He didn't take Kennedy's weird bait (I absolutely would have called Kennedy racist to his face, but I don't want to be AG), and instead gave a very legalistic definition of systemic racism. Like most judges who come before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Garland is more knowledgeable about the law than most of the people asking him questions. But that's not why Garland will get Republican votes. Gupta or Clarke or any other Black or brown person could have answered these bad-faith questions with the same calm and clarity that Garland did, but Republicans would not have been persuaded. Even when people of color toe the line in front of Senate committees, most Republicans still find a way to vote against them. They call them \"toxic,\" or say they are \"divisive,\" or question their experience or qualifications. Those are all things Manchin (not a \"Republican,\" according to some), Susan Collins, and Mitt Romney have said about Tanden within the past week . Some people will say Tanden is a special case, but just roll the tape back and look at what Republicans did to the last Democrat nominated for attorney general, Loretta Lynch. During her confirmation hearing , Republicans spent most of their time criticizing her predecessor, Eric Holder. Then they criticized her willingness to apply Obama's immigration laws. (Sessions, then still a senator, called those laws \"indefensible\" and her position \"very troubling.\") Despite not being able to lay a glove on her during the hearing, Republicans refused to hold a vote on her appointment for six months. She was eventually confirmed with 10 Republican votes (five of those crossover senators are no longer in the Senate), over the loud objections of Sessions, Cruz, and Chuck Grassley, then chair of the Judiciary Committee. Related Article A Defense of Neera Tanden's Tweets (but Not of Neera Tanden) David Klion Garland won't have as difficult a ride. Remember: The reason Mitch McConnell denied Garland a hearing when he was nominated for the Supreme Court was that he would have been easily confirmed, with support from Republican senators, if McConnell had ever allowed his nomination to come to a vote. The kinds of games Republicans play just don't work on white male cis-het normies. I suppose all of this was very smart on the part of the Biden administration. The next attorney general has a lot of work to do; Garland said that bringing the Capitol insurrectionists to justice was his number-one priority. Putting forward an unobjectionable white man is a good way to fill this important post quickly and get to the business of restoring the Justice Department after its reputation and mission have been degraded by Sessions and Barr. But I wish Biden had just nominated a woman of color who would put the fear of God into these Republicans. I wouldn't have minded an AG that was confirmed 51-50 with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie. Promoting women of color cannot be done in a bipartisan fashion. Republicans will not allow it. When Democrats look for nominees that can be confirmed with strong bipartisan support, they are essentially excluding women of color simply because Republicans will vociferously object to any woman of color put forward. The solution is not to ignore those qualified candidates, but to ignore Republicans and get other Democrats to fall in line. Picking your battles is an important part of governance. But the fact that Republicans force a battle over every woman of color who is nominated for anything is the precise definition I would have given for \"systemic racism\" in front of the Judiciary Committee.\n\nHe's getting confirmed.

He didn't have to. \"That doesn't sound like a question for me, Senator\" would have been a perfectly acceptable non-answer to the filthy questions posed by Lee. I guess when Republicans make you wait five years to get a hearing, it makes you less inclined to let their crap slide. But the Republican long game isn't just to trash the specific appointments of Gupta and Clarke, both of whom are as qualified as Garland is for the top job at the Justice Department, and more than qualified for the positions to which they've been nominated. Their goal is to delegitimize the quest for social and racial justice and accuse anybody who strives for equality under the law to be harboring anti-white (which to them means \"anti-American\") views. Lee rounded out his questioning by asking Garland to give \"assurances\" that Garland's DOJ would protect religious people, as if it's the attorney general's job to make discrimination against the LGBTQ community constitutional if people claim Jesus made them do it. Ted Cruz wasted all his time criticizing the \"politicization and weaponization\" of the Justice Department under (wait for it) Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch. Presumably, Cruz was in Cancún during the tenures of Jeff Sessions and Bill Barr. Kennedy asked Garland to explain \"systemic racism\" and \"implicit bias\" in a truly bizarre set of questions that seemed almost like he was trying to bait Garland into calling him a racist. And Tom Cotton asked : \"Are you aware President Biden has signed an executive order stating his administration will affirmatively advance racial equity, not racial equality but racial equity?\" Those two words mean the same thing, but clearly Cotton wanted the white people listening to think there is a difference. One thing I find curious about the most openly racist people in our society is that they are sure the real goal of racial justice is to treat white people like Black people have been treated, as opposed to the stated and logical goal of treating Black people like people-people, which is something this country has still never tried. Republicans like Cotton are truly only ever able to see racial equality as a zero-sum game: One race always has to be preferred over all others, in his mind. It's why Cotton will always fail. Garland gave the \"right\" answers to all of these questions. He said he didn't see a difference between \"equality\" and \"equity.\" He wouldn't comment about Holder or Lynch. He didn't take Kennedy's weird bait (I absolutely would have called Kennedy racist to his face, but I don't want to be AG), and instead gave a very legalistic definition of systemic racism. Like most judges who come before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Garland is more knowledgeable about the law than most of the people asking him questions. But that's not why Garland will get Republican votes. Gupta or Clarke or any other Black or brown person could have answered these bad-faith questions with the same calm and clarity that Garland did, but Republicans would not have been persuaded. Even when people of color toe the line in front of Senate committees, most Republicans still find a way to vote against them. They call them \"toxic,\" or say they are \"divisive,\" or question their experience or qualifications. Those are all things Manchin (not a \"Republican,\" according to some), Susan Collins, and Mitt Romney have said about Tanden within the past week . Some people will say Tanden is a special case, but just roll the tape back and look at what Republicans did to the last Democrat nominated for attorney general, Loretta Lynch. During her confirmation hearing , Republicans spent most of their time criticizing her predecessor, Eric Holder. Then they criticized her willingness to apply Obama's immigration laws. (Sessions, then still a senator, called those laws \"indefensible\" and her position \"very troubling.\") Despite not being able to lay a glove on her during the hearing, Republicans refused to hold a vote on her appointment for six months. She was eventually confirmed with 10 Republican votes (five of those crossover senators are no longer in the Senate), over the loud objections of Sessions, Cruz, and Chuck Grassley, then chair of the Judiciary Committee. Related Article A Defense of Neera Tanden's Tweets (but Not of Neera Tanden) David Klion Garland won't have as difficult a ride. Remember: The reason Mitch McConnell denied Garland a hearing when he was nominated for the Supreme Court was that he would have been easily confirmed, with support from Republican senators, if McConnell had ever allowed his nomination to come to a vote. The kinds of games Republicans play just don't work on white male cis-het normies. I suppose all of this was very smart on the part of the Biden administration. The next attorney general has a lot of work to do; Garland said that bringing the Capitol insurrectionists to justice was his number-one priority. Putting forward an unobjectionable white man is a good way to fill this important post quickly and get to the business of restoring the Justice Department after its reputation and mission have been degraded by Sessions and Barr. But I wish Biden had just nominated a woman of color who would put the fear of God into these Republicans. I wouldn't have minded an AG that was confirmed 51-50 with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie. Promoting women of color cannot be done in a bipartisan fashion. Republicans will not allow it. When Democrats look for nominees that can be confirmed with strong bipartisan support, they are essentially excluding women of color simply because Republicans will vociferously object to any woman of color put forward. The solution is not to ignore those qualified candidates, but to ignore Republicans and get other Democrats to fall in line. Picking your battles is an important part of governance. But the fact that Republicans force a battle over every woman of color who is nominated for anything is the precise definition I would have given for \"systemic racism\" in front of the Judiciary Committee.\n\nLee didn't have any heat for Lisa Monaco, who has been nominated to be deputy attorney general, but is white. It has become de rigueur for Republicans to allege or imply that Black civil rights activists, like Clarke, are secretly anti-Semitic. Clarke was the head of a campus organization at Harvard that invited Tony Martin, an anti-Semitic author, to speak out against Charles Murray's The Bell Curve . Clarke was 19 at the time, and she has said she made a mistake. Perhaps if Clarke had tried to rape Martin, instead of inviting him as a speaker, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee would accept her apology for her youthful error.

He didn't have to. \"That doesn't sound like a question for me, Senator\" would have been a perfectly acceptable non-answer to the filthy questions posed by Lee. I guess when Republicans make you wait five years to get a hearing, it makes you less inclined to let their crap slide. But the Republican long game isn't just to trash the specific appointments of Gupta and Clarke, both of whom are as qualified as Garland is for the top job at the Justice Department, and more than qualified for the positions to which they've been nominated. Their goal is to delegitimize the quest for social and racial justice and accuse anybody who strives for equality under the law to be harboring anti-white (which to them means \"anti-American\") views. Lee rounded out his questioning by asking Garland to give \"assurances\" that Garland's DOJ would protect religious people, as if it's the attorney general's job to make discrimination against the LGBTQ community constitutional if people claim Jesus made them do it. Ted Cruz wasted all his time criticizing the \"politicization and weaponization\" of the Justice Department under (wait for it) Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch. Presumably, Cruz was in Cancún during the tenures of Jeff Sessions and Bill Barr. Kennedy asked Garland to explain \"systemic racism\" and \"implicit bias\" in a truly bizarre set of questions that seemed almost like he was trying to bait Garland into calling him a racist. And Tom Cotton asked : \"Are you aware President Biden has signed an executive order stating his administration will affirmatively advance racial equity, not racial equality but racial equity?\" Those two words mean the same thing, but clearly Cotton wanted the white people listening to think there is a difference. One thing I find curious about the most openly racist people in our society is that they are sure the real goal of racial justice is to treat white people like Black people have been treated, as opposed to the stated and logical goal of treating Black people like people-people, which is something this country has still never tried. Republicans like Cotton are truly only ever able to see racial equality as a zero-sum game: One race always has to be preferred over all others, in his mind. It's why Cotton will always fail. Garland gave the \"right\" answers to all of these questions. He said he didn't see a difference between \"equality\" and \"equity.\" He wouldn't comment about Holder or Lynch. He didn't take Kennedy's weird bait (I absolutely would have called Kennedy racist to his face, but I don't want to be AG), and instead gave a very legalistic definition of systemic racism. Like most judges who come before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Garland is more knowledgeable about the law than most of the people asking him questions. But that's not why Garland will get Republican votes. Gupta or Clarke or any other Black or brown person could have answered these bad-faith questions with the same calm and clarity that Garland did, but Republicans would not have been persuaded. Even when people of color toe the line in front of Senate committees, most Republicans still find a way to vote against them. They call them \"toxic,\" or say they are \"divisive,\" or question their experience or qualifications. Those are all things Manchin (not a \"Republican,\" according to some), Susan Collins, and Mitt Romney have said about Tanden within the past week . Some people will say Tanden is a special case, but just roll the tape back and look at what Republicans did to the last Democrat nominated for attorney general, Loretta Lynch. During her confirmation hearing , Republicans spent most of their time criticizing her predecessor, Eric Holder. Then they criticized her willingness to apply Obama's immigration laws. (Sessions, then still a senator, called those laws \"indefensible\" and her position \"very troubling.\") Despite not being able to lay a glove on her during the hearing, Republicans refused to hold a vote on her appointment for six months. She was eventually confirmed with 10 Republican votes (five of those crossover senators are no longer in the Senate), over the loud objections of Sessions, Cruz, and Chuck Grassley, then chair of the Judiciary Committee.

(Fototeca Gilardi / Getty Images)\n\nBirthright citizenship is the foundation of American democracy. The birthright principle, rooted in common law and the Reconstruction era's 14th Amendment, guarantees citizenship to the children of US citizens and to everyone born within the country's borders. The grant of citizenship at birth has a powerful egalitarian effect, making every American-at least in theory-an equal stakeholder in the political community. Yet it brings about this desirable result through what can only be described as arbitrary means. One inherits citizenship from one's parents or acquires it based on the happenstance of one's place of birth. Our democracy of equal-born citizens is therefore built on a fundamental inequality: the unearned privilege of winning what the scholar Ayelet Shachar has called \"the birthright lottery.\" 1 Books in Review Race Is About Politics: Lessons From History By Jean-Frédéric Schaub; Lara Vergnaud, trans. Buy this book Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America By Martha S. Jones Buy this book Two recent histories explain how the illiberal birthright principle has become so fundamental to modern democracies. In Race Is About Politics , the French historian Jean-Frédéric Schaub offers an elegant and polemical account of how the idea of racial difference, first crafted in medieval Spain, grew into a defining form of political otherness. Birthright Citizens , the most recent book by the prominent historian of law and race Martha S. Jones, gives us a closer look at how this process unfolded in the United States. Taking us through the streets and into the courthouses of 19th century Baltimore, Jones shows us how free African Americans asserted their citizenship as a birthright in order to counter the hereditary logic of race and, in so doing, helped lay the groundwork for the 14th Amendment's guarantee of citizenship to all those born on US soil. 2 Taken together, Race Is About Politics and Birthright Citizens show the power as well as the limits of birthright politics-how it can be a vehicle for liberation and equality and how it can serve the cause of racial and ethnic exclusion. Both books acknowledge the potential of birthright politics to generate inclusive and equal citizenship. They also show that beneath its surface, currents of inequality persist that can make it a treacherous medium for creating a more just society. 3 B irthright has been part of political life at least since Jacob bought the blessings of the firstborn from his brother, Esau. From the ancient world through the early modern era, birth determined one's station in life. Born a king or a nobleman, one had rights and duties that a commoner would never have. One's place of birth mattered, too: The native sons of a city had privileges denied to the peasants born a stone's throw outside its walls. However, in practice, the premodern world was more socially and politically dynamic than the theory might suggest. Commoners could become noblemen-kings, even-and nobles could fall into a penury little different from that of the peasantry. But the principle of birthright remained the rule. A natural-born subject, wrote the English jurist William Blackstone in 1765, owed a \"perpetual\" allegiance to his sovereign from the moment of his birth, one that could never be \"forfeited, cancelled, or altered.\" 4 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas Books & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas Books & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal Starting in the mid-15th century, birthright politics took on a new form: the notion of race. As Schaub observes early in his book, the history of race is often flattened into a timeless and universal practice of differentiation based on how people look. But the idea of race, he insists, began as something else. It was not about appearance at all; in fact, early racial thought differentiated among groups that looked alike. Race was an ideology that sought to draw boundaries of political community through genealogy and birthright. By \"naturaliz[ing]\" forms of \"sociopolitical difference,\" it applied a new and pernicious patina to the age-old practice of inherited political status. 5 To make his argument, Schaub retells the story of the racialization of Jews in the Iberian Peninsula-which he sees as a key passage in the development of both racial thought and modern birthright politics. Starting in the eighth century, most of Iberia fell under the rule of a succession of Muslim states, which were content to let the region's large Jewish population exist in relative peace and autonomy. But as Christian kingdoms gradually conquered the peninsula during the Middle Ages, they and the Catholic Church sought to enforce religious conformity on their newly acquired lands. Jews were massacred or subjected to mass forced conversions. In 1492 the \"Catholic Monarchs\" Ferdinand and Isabella of Aragon and Castile completed the conquest and brought this process to its conclusion, forcing all of the remaining Jews to convert to Catholicism or leave. 6 Yet even as they were stamping out the last pockets of Judaism in Iberia, Spain's Old Christians, jealous of the social and political power they might lose to the new converts, were finding ways to perpetuate their outsider status. By the 1440s, Old Christians had formalized in law an early form of racial ideology that rested on a distinction between two kinds of otherness: Jewish belief and Jewishness. The Jewish faith could be washed away at the baptismal font. But Jewishness was something else altogether-a form of genealogical inferiority embedded in Jewish bodies. It passed from one generation to the next, and it was unalterable. Jews were a different people as well as a different faith. Although they could convert, they would retain their racial otherness (which was also invisible, since the conversos looked just like the Old Christians). 7 Current Issue View our current issue In the decades after their first contact with the Americas in 1492, Iberians and other Europeans carried this emerging racial ideology around the globe, creating an expansive portfolio of racializing theories to mark off many other groups as permanent outsiders. They increasingly imagined Native Americans and sub-Saharan Africans as distinct races, granting themselves license to take their lands and reduce their people to serfdom or slavery. Unlike the conversos , many of these populations had physical features, especially skin color, that created visible forms of distinction between them and Europeans. Though Europeans used these features to identify the members of the various \"races,\" their fundamental difference, they insisted, was genealogical-an inheritance from birth, as with the Jews of Iberia. 8 The racialization of non-Europeans in the Americas and Africa thus became an essential part of European efforts to draw lines of political exclusion within and around their empires, putting millions of people outside the circle of citizenship and, in some cases, outside the circle of humanity itself. Unlike other forms of identity and political membership, this birthright politics enfolded many Europeans, including women and even members of other religious groups, as natural-born members of a racial community. But it excluded many others and insisted that belonging was an immutable fact, lodging racial otherness in the body and making the boundaries between in-groups and out-groups permanent and unalterable. 9 This racialized logic of birthright, as Schaub observes, has remained latent in Western politics ever since, wielded by dominant groups over and over again as a way to slow down or stop the social and political ascent of subordinated communities. 10 W hen the United States emerged as an independent nation, it seemed to promise at least a partial break from the idea that political belonging should be the result of birth alone. Starting with their 1776 decision to disavow the British monarch, American revolutionaries insisted that theirs was a community of citizens who freely chose to be part of the nation. Their actions in subsequent decades gave some substance to those claims. The 1790 Naturalization Act, the new nation's first immigration law, let any free white person enter the country and become an American citizen more or less at will. Some US politicians even seemed inclined to accept the claim that citizens could expatriate themselves-that is, give up their citizenship. In 1795, Supreme Court Justice James Iredell even ruminated about whether expatriation was a \"natural, inalienable right\" that could not be limited or regulated by the state. 11 Related Article Julius Scott's Epic About Black Resistance in the Age of Revolution Manisha Sinha Yet status by birth entrenched itself in the politics of the new republic as well. A few exceptions aside, the nation's founders embraced a birthright notion of race not unlike that of the Spanish-which they then used to justify slavery and the denial of rights and citizenship to nonwhite people living in US territories. At the time of the American Revolution, roughly one out of every six inhabitants of the American colonies was an enslaved African. White Americans justified their status on the grounds that Africans were members of a different and inferior race, whose stain passed from generation to generation. 12 Members of the founding generation, eager to expand the white population of their new country, took an equally expansive view of the birthright principle's application to members of their racial group. David Ramsay, a South Carolina congressman and early theorist of US citizenship, believed that American citizens \"transmitted\" their citizenship to their children \"by inheritance.\" Before long, judges and legislators had extended this potent principle of hereditary citizenship to include any white person born to US citizens abroad and to white people born to noncitizens on American soil. 13 In Birthright Citizens , Jones explores how a small but significant free African American community tried to turn the young republic's birthright politics on its head, transforming a doctrine of exclusion and hierarchy into a means by which they could claim a place for themselves in American society. Free African Americans, like many people of color in the Atlantic world, were relentlessly pursued by the possibility that their race, not their status as free people, was their true birthright. The risks of exclusion or expulsion and the nightmare of reenslavement were a constant presence in their lives. Claiming American citizenship as an inalienable birthright was a crucial way for free African Americans to overcome these dangers-and, Jones argues, their claims had a lasting impact on the nature of citizenship for all Americans. 14 Baltimore was a center of these efforts by free African Americans to assert their inborn right to US citizenship, and Jones focuses her narrative on their story. As members of an old and relatively wealthy community, Baltimore's African Americans were well equipped to use the city's courts as a forum for demonstrating their citizenship by exercising the rights of free people. They sued fellow Baltimoreans of both races over matters great and small, from a debt of a few tens of dollars to control of a prosperous Methodist church and its property. These suits protected their property, but they also had symbolic value: Even an unsuccessful suit affirmed a litigant's status as a legal person. While in court, black litigants could, as Jones put it, become \"peers to their white counterparts.\" And the act of going to court, repeated year in and year out, could be used to make claims, however tenuous, about citizenship and equality. 15 But exercising one's rights in court proved to be a weak guarantor of African American citizenship. Throughout the antebellum period, in Baltimore and elsewhere, white legislators and jurists worked to reduce African Americans to the status of \"denizens,\" a category in English common law for individuals who were designated neither native nor foreign and occupied a middle ground between full membership and full exclusion. In Maryland alone, the state legislature heaped on law after law that sought to impose this second-class status on black people in the state. African Americans could not freely or easily leave the state, they could not vote, and they faced restrictions on owning firearms (though in practice, white judges in Baltimore routinely granted gun licenses to black men). African American citizenship, in short, was perpetually under assault. 16 Starting in the 1820s, Baltimore's African Americans found their citizenship status threatened in a new and frightening way by the so-called colonization movement. Colonization was a project, led by white Americans, that sought to empty the country of free people of color. Most proponents of colonization did not envision forcibly expelling free people of color but wanted them to leave of their own volition. Yet even if it was not backed by a threat of force, colonization posed an existential threat to African American citizenship: All such projects rested on the assumption that the true home of African Americans was somewhere else. When coupled with measures designed to make life in the United States difficult for free people of color, as it often was, colonization took on the sinister, coercive overtones of ethnic cleansing. 17 To counter the threat of colonization and other efforts to reduce them to the status of denizens, black Baltimoreans and their allies began to declare their citizenship an inalienable birthright. \"We are Americans, having a birthright citizenship,\" wrote the Pennsylvanian African American leader Martin Delany in 1852, and activists in Baltimore transformed this claim into their political creed. Inalienable citizenship was defined by the same birthbound language that was used to exclude them. In 1831, Baltimore's leading black citizens issued a declaration proclaiming themselves natives of the \"land in which we were born\" and insisting that it was thus their \"true and appropriate home.\" William Yates, a white activist whom Jones discusses at length, expanded on this notion in an 1838 treatise. Free people of color, he argued, were undoubtedly citizens because they were \"natives of the country.\" 18 These claims by black Baltimoreans began to resound forcefully beyond the city's borders in the run-up to the Civil War. The most striking illustration of their reach, curiously enough, came from the pen of a famous opponent of black citizenship, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Roger B. Taney. As a son of the city and a leading Maryland politician before joining the court, he was intimately familiar with the black Baltimoreans and their claims to US citizenship. Both were clearly on his mind in 1857 when he authored the court's notorious opinion in Dred Scott v. Sanford , an appeal of a freedom suit brought by an enslaved man from the Midwest. Going well beyond what was necessary to resolve the case presented to the court, Taney decided to use it as an opportunity to pronounce against African Americans' aspirations to citizenship in general. His opinion provided a decisive rebuff to black Baltimoreans' claims. African Americans, he baldly declared, were \"not citizens.\" The \"unhappy black race,\" he continued (in language that closely echoed the Iberians' more than four centuries earlier), \"were separated from the white by indelible marks.\" 19 Jones's book closes with a brief discussion of Reconstruction, which gives a tantalizing glimpse of the connections between African American claims to birthright citizenship in the antebellum period and the arguments about it after the Civil War that culminated in the 14th Amendment. The aftermath of the war saw a final struggle, played out across the country, to remove the persistent doubts about the citizenship status of former enslaved people and freeborn African Americans alike. The 14th Amendment, adopted in 1868, aimed to remove all ambiguity on this point by constitutionalizing the very principle of birthright citizenship that activists for African American rights had been hammering home for decades. \"All persons born...in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,\" the amendment states, \"are citizens of the United States.\" By the time this language was adopted, black Baltimoreans were no longer prophets in the wilderness: The idea of citizenship for African Americans had gained substantial acceptance in the North. But they were surely gratified to find their argument set, at long last, into the US Constitution. 20 I n the century and a half since its ratification, the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment has been without doubt a force for good, a powerful instrument for unambiguously confirming membership in the American nation. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, in the face of virulent anti-Chinese racism, the clause guaranteed the citizenship of individuals born to Chinese parents on US soil. It did likewise for the children of Eastern and Southern European immigrants who came to the United States in the early 20th century, and in more recent times, it has extended citizenship to the American-born children of undocumented immigrants from Latin America and other regions. 21 Yet as Schaub's historical genealogy of racial thought reminds us, there is a flip side to this coin. Like the idea of race to which it is sometimes opposed, the birthright principle works through inheritance, passing status from parent to child as if it were an innate quality in a bloodline. It can also confer the same status based on the accident of where one is born. In either case, the birthright principle distributes citizenship's privileges and blessings by chance rather than in accordance with any higher principle of justice. In practice, this means equality for some is bought at the price of arbitrary exclusion for many. 22 For much of the recent past, Americans have uncritically accepted the bargain we have struck between these two faces of the birthright principle. The benefits of inclusion have seemed to far outweigh its exclusionary, illiberal mechanism for deciding who is in and who is out. But in our age of global inequality, it is clear the arbitrary belonging created by birthright politics is no longer adequate to our moment. Globally, the distribution of wealth among the world's countries has reached unprecedented levels of inequality and continues to grow more extreme. The negative externalities of runaway consumption, above all climate change and its effects, are falling hardest on the countries and peoples least able to bear the burden. Infectious diseases-of which the novel coronavirus is just the latest arrival-kill millions of people in poorer countries as the citizens of the richest nations shut their gates and hoard medicine and supplies. How is it even remotely fair to allocate citizenship in the world's nations by mere random chance when so much depends on which ticket one draws? 23 Rethinking the politics of birthright will not be easy. The roots of birthright belonging extend deep into the soil of the American political tradition. And as Schaub and Jones remind us, over the past two centuries we have gained a great deal, in terms of equality and inclusion, from the audacious grafting of democratic institutions onto a political community defined by birthright. But as the modern world of nation-states enters its third century and perhaps comes to its crisis, we will have to take a hard look at the birthright principle and decide if it is still right-if, indeed, we can still accept it. Should birth alone dictate so much about who we are? 24\n\nBy Jean-Frédéric Schaub; Lara Vergnaud, trans.\n\nBuy this book\n\nBy Martha S.

Going well beyond what was necessary to resolve the case presented to the court, Taney decided to use it as an opportunity to pronounce against African Americans' aspirations to citizenship in general. His opinion provided a decisive rebuff to black Baltimoreans' claims. African Americans, he baldly declared, were \"not citizens.\" The \"unhappy black race,\" he continued (in language that closely echoed the Iberians' more than four centuries earlier), \"were separated from the white by indelible marks.\" 19 Jones's book closes with a brief discussion of Reconstruction, which gives a tantalizing glimpse of the connections between African American claims to birthright citizenship in the antebellum period and the arguments about it after the Civil War that culminated in the 14th Amendment. The aftermath of the war saw a final struggle, played out across the country, to remove the persistent doubts about the citizenship status of former enslaved people and freeborn African Americans alike. The 14th Amendment, adopted in 1868, aimed to remove all ambiguity on this point by constitutionalizing the very principle of birthright citizenship that activists for African American rights had been hammering home for decades. \"All persons born...in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,\" the amendment states, \"are citizens of the United States.\" By the time this language was adopted, black Baltimoreans were no longer prophets in the wilderness: The idea of citizenship for African Americans had gained substantial acceptance in the North. But they were surely gratified to find their argument set, at long last, into the US Constitution. 20 I n the century and a half since its ratification, the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment has been without doubt a force for good, a powerful instrument for unambiguously confirming membership in the American nation. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, in the face of virulent anti-Chinese racism, the clause guaranteed the citizenship of individuals born to Chinese parents on US soil. It did likewise for the children of Eastern and Southern European immigrants who came to the United States in the early 20th century, and in more recent times, it has extended citizenship to the American-born children of undocumented immigrants from Latin America and other regions. 21 Yet as Schaub's historical genealogy of racial thought reminds us, there is a flip side to this coin. Like the idea of race to which it is sometimes opposed, the birthright principle works through inheritance, passing status from parent to child as if it were an innate quality in a bloodline. It can also confer the same status based on the accident of where one is born. In either case, the birthright principle distributes citizenship's privileges and blessings by chance rather than in accordance with any higher principle of justice. In practice, this means equality for some is bought at the price of arbitrary exclusion for many. 22 For much of the recent past, Americans have uncritically accepted the bargain we have struck between these two faces of the birthright principle. The benefits of inclusion have seemed to far outweigh its exclusionary, illiberal mechanism for deciding who is in and who is out. But in our age of global inequality, it is clear the arbitrary belonging created by birthright politics is no longer adequate to our moment. Globally, the distribution of wealth among the world's countries has reached unprecedented levels of inequality and continues to grow more extreme. The negative externalities of runaway consumption, above all climate change and its effects, are falling hardest on the countries and peoples least able to bear the burden. Infectious diseases-of which the novel coronavirus is just the latest arrival-kill millions of people in poorer countries as the citizens of the richest nations shut their gates and hoard medicine and supplies. How is it even remotely fair to allocate citizenship in the world's nations by mere random chance when so much depends on which ticket one draws? 23 Rethinking the politics of birthright will not be easy. The roots of birthright belonging extend deep into the soil of the American political tradition. And as Schaub and Jones remind us, over the past two centuries we have gained a great deal, in terms of equality and inclusion, from the audacious grafting of democratic institutions onto a political community defined by birthright. But as the modern world of nation-states enters its third century and perhaps comes to its crisis, we will have to take a hard look at the birthright principle and decide if it is still right-if, indeed, we can still accept it. Should birth alone dictate so much about who we are? 24\n\nTaken together, Race Is About Politics and Birthright Citizens show the power as well as the limits of birthright politics-how it can be a vehicle for liberation and equality and how it can serve the cause of racial and ethnic exclusion. Both books acknowledge the potential of birthright politics to generate inclusive and equal citizenship. They also show that beneath its surface, currents of inequality persist that can make it a treacherous medium for creating a more just society. 3 B irthright has been part of political life at least since Jacob bought the blessings of the firstborn from his brother, Esau. From the ancient world through the early modern era, birth determined one's station in life. Born a king or a nobleman, one had rights and duties that a commoner would never have. One's place of birth mattered, too: The native sons of a city had privileges denied to the peasants born a stone's throw outside its walls. However, in practice, the premodern world was more socially and politically dynamic than the theory might suggest. Commoners could become noblemen-kings, even-and nobles could fall into a penury little different from that of the peasantry. But the principle of birthright remained the rule. A natural-born subject, wrote the English jurist William Blackstone in 1765, owed a \"perpetual\" allegiance to his sovereign from the moment of his birth, one that could never be \"forfeited, cancelled, or altered.\" 4 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas Books & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas Books & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal Starting in the mid-15th century, birthright politics took on a new form: the notion of race. As Schaub observes early in his book, the history of race is often flattened into a timeless and universal practice of differentiation based on how people look. But the idea of race, he insists, began as something else. It was not about appearance at all; in fact, early racial thought differentiated among groups that looked alike. Race was an ideology that sought to draw boundaries of political community through genealogy and birthright. By \"naturaliz[ing]\" forms of \"sociopolitical difference,\" it applied a new and pernicious patina to the age-old practice of inherited political status. 5 To make his argument, Schaub retells the story of the racialization of Jews in the Iberian Peninsula-which he sees as a key passage in the development of both racial thought and modern birthright politics. Starting in the eighth century, most of Iberia fell under the rule of a succession of Muslim states, which were content to let the region's large Jewish population exist in relative peace and autonomy. But as Christian kingdoms gradually conquered the peninsula during the Middle Ages, they and the Catholic Church sought to enforce religious conformity on their newly acquired lands. Jews were massacred or subjected to mass forced conversions. In 1492 the \"Catholic Monarchs\" Ferdinand and Isabella of Aragon and Castile completed the conquest and brought this process to its conclusion, forcing all of the remaining Jews to convert to Catholicism or leave. 6 Yet even as they were stamping out the last pockets of Judaism in Iberia, Spain's Old Christians, jealous of the social and political power they might lose to the new converts, were finding ways to perpetuate their outsider status. By the 1440s, Old Christians had formalized in law an early form of racial ideology that rested on a distinction between two kinds of otherness: Jewish belief and Jewishness. The Jewish faith could be washed away at the baptismal font. But Jewishness was something else altogether-a form of genealogical inferiority embedded in Jewish bodies. It passed from one generation to the next, and it was unalterable. Jews were a different people as well as a different faith. Although they could convert, they would retain their racial otherness (which was also invisible, since the conversos looked just like the Old Christians). 7 Current Issue View our current issue In the decades after their first contact with the Americas in 1492, Iberians and other Europeans carried this emerging racial ideology around the globe, creating an expansive portfolio of racializing theories to mark off many other groups as permanent outsiders. They increasingly imagined Native Americans and sub-Saharan Africans as distinct races, granting themselves license to take their lands and reduce their people to serfdom or slavery. Unlike the conversos , many of these populations had physical features, especially skin color, that created visible forms of distinction between them and Europeans. Though Europeans used these features to identify the members of the various \"races,\" their fundamental difference, they insisted, was genealogical-an inheritance from birth, as with the Jews of Iberia. 8 The racialization of non-Europeans in the Americas and Africa thus became an essential part of European efforts to draw lines of political exclusion within and around their empires, putting millions of people outside the circle of citizenship and, in some cases, outside the circle of humanity itself. Unlike other forms of identity and political membership, this birthright politics enfolded many Europeans, including women and even members of other religious groups, as natural-born members of a racial community. But it excluded many others and insisted that belonging was an immutable fact, lodging racial otherness in the body and making the boundaries between in-groups and out-groups permanent and unalterable. 9 This racialized logic of birthright, as Schaub observes, has remained latent in Western politics ever since, wielded by dominant groups over and over again as a way to slow down or stop the social and political ascent of subordinated communities. 10 W hen the United States emerged as an independent nation, it seemed to promise at least a partial break from the idea that political belonging should be the result of birth alone. Starting with their 1776 decision to disavow the British monarch, American revolutionaries insisted that theirs was a community of citizens who freely chose to be part of the nation. Their actions in subsequent decades gave some substance to those claims. The 1790 Naturalization Act, the new nation's first immigration law, let any free white person enter the country and become an American citizen more or less at will. Some US politicians even seemed inclined to accept the claim that citizens could expatriate themselves-that is, give up their citizenship. In 1795, Supreme Court Justice James Iredell even ruminated about whether expatriation was a \"natural, inalienable right\" that could not be limited or regulated by the state. 11 Related Article Julius Scott's Epic About Black Resistance in the Age of Revolution Manisha Sinha Yet status by birth entrenched itself in the politics of the new republic as well. A few exceptions aside, the nation's founders embraced a birthright notion of race not unlike that of the Spanish-which they then used to justify slavery and the denial of rights and citizenship to nonwhite people living in US territories. At the time of the American Revolution, roughly one out of every six inhabitants of the American colonies was an enslaved African. White Americans justified their status on the grounds that Africans were members of a different and inferior race, whose stain passed from generation to generation. 12 Members of the founding generation, eager to expand the white population of their new country, took an equally expansive view of the birthright principle's application to members of their racial group. David Ramsay, a South Carolina congressman and early theorist of US citizenship, believed that American citizens \"transmitted\" their citizenship to their children \"by inheritance.\" Before long, judges and legislators had extended this potent principle of hereditary citizenship to include any white person born to US citizens abroad and to white people born to noncitizens on American soil. 13 In Birthright Citizens , Jones explores how a small but significant free African American community tried to turn the young republic's birthright politics on its head, transforming a doctrine of exclusion and hierarchy into a means by which they could claim a place for themselves in American society. Free African Americans, like many people of color in the Atlantic world, were relentlessly pursued by the possibility that their race, not their status as free people, was their true birthright. The risks of exclusion or expulsion and the nightmare of reenslavement were a constant presence in their lives. Claiming American citizenship as an inalienable birthright was a crucial way for free African Americans to overcome these dangers-and, Jones argues, their claims had a lasting impact on the nature of citizenship for all Americans. 14 Baltimore was a center of these efforts by free African Americans to assert their inborn right to US citizenship, and Jones focuses her narrative on their story. As members of an old and relatively wealthy community, Baltimore's African Americans were well equipped to use the city's courts as a forum for demonstrating their citizenship by exercising the rights of free people. They sued fellow Baltimoreans of both races over matters great and small, from a debt of a few tens of dollars to control of a prosperous Methodist church and its property. These suits protected their property, but they also had symbolic value: Even an unsuccessful suit affirmed a litigant's status as a legal person. While in court, black litigants could, as Jones put it, become \"peers to their white counterparts.\" And the act of going to court, repeated year in and year out, could be used to make claims, however tenuous, about citizenship and equality. 15 But exercising one's rights in court proved to be a weak guarantor of African American citizenship. Throughout the antebellum period, in Baltimore and elsewhere, white legislators and jurists worked to reduce African Americans to the status of \"denizens,\" a category in English common law for individuals who were designated neither native nor foreign and occupied a middle ground between full membership and full exclusion. In Maryland alone, the state legislature heaped on law after law that sought to impose this second-class status on black people in the state. African Americans could not freely or easily leave the state, they could not vote, and they faced restrictions on owning firearms (though in practice, white judges in Baltimore routinely granted gun licenses to black men). African American citizenship, in short, was perpetually under assault. 16 Starting in the 1820s, Baltimore's African Americans found their citizenship status threatened in a new and frightening way by the so-called colonization movement. Colonization was a project, led by white Americans, that sought to empty the country of free people of color. Most proponents of colonization did not envision forcibly expelling free people of color but wanted them to leave of their own volition. Yet even if it was not backed by a threat of force, colonization posed an existential threat to African American citizenship: All such projects rested on the assumption that the true home of African Americans was somewhere else. When coupled with measures designed to make life in the United States difficult for free people of color, as it often was, colonization took on the sinister, coercive overtones of ethnic cleansing. 17 To counter the threat of colonization and other efforts to reduce them to the status of denizens, black Baltimoreans and their allies began to declare their citizenship an inalienable birthright. \"We are Americans, having a birthright citizenship,\" wrote the Pennsylvanian African American leader Martin Delany in 1852, and activists in Baltimore transformed this claim into their political creed. Inalienable citizenship was defined by the same birthbound language that was used to exclude them. In 1831, Baltimore's leading black citizens issued a declaration proclaiming themselves natives of the \"land in which we were born\" and insisting that it was thus their \"true and appropriate home.\" William Yates, a white activist whom Jones discusses at length, expanded on this notion in an 1838 treatise. Free people of color, he argued, were undoubtedly citizens because they were \"natives of the country.\" 18 These claims by black Baltimoreans began to resound forcefully beyond the city's borders in the run-up to the Civil War. The most striking illustration of their reach, curiously enough, came from the pen of a famous opponent of black citizenship, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Roger B. Taney. As a son of the city and a leading Maryland politician before joining the court, he was intimately familiar with the black Baltimoreans and their claims to US citizenship. Both were clearly on his mind in 1857 when he authored the court's notorious opinion in Dred Scott v. Sanford , an appeal of a freedom suit brought by an enslaved man from the Midwest.

It did likewise for the children of Eastern and Southern European immigrants who came to the United States in the early 20th century, and in more recent times, it has extended citizenship to the American-born children of undocumented immigrants from Latin America and other regions. 21 Yet as Schaub's historical genealogy of racial thought reminds us, there is a flip side to this coin. Like the idea of race to which it is sometimes opposed, the birthright principle works through inheritance, passing status from parent to child as if it were an innate quality in a bloodline. It can also confer the same status based on the accident of where one is born. In either case, the birthright principle distributes citizenship's privileges and blessings by chance rather than in accordance with any higher principle of justice. In practice, this means equality for some is bought at the price of arbitrary exclusion for many. 22 For much of the recent past, Americans have uncritically accepted the bargain we have struck between these two faces of the birthright principle. The benefits of inclusion have seemed to far outweigh its exclusionary, illiberal mechanism for deciding who is in and who is out. But in our age of global inequality, it is clear the arbitrary belonging created by birthright politics is no longer adequate to our moment. Globally, the distribution of wealth among the world's countries has reached unprecedented levels of inequality and continues to grow more extreme. The negative externalities of runaway consumption, above all climate change and its effects, are falling hardest on the countries and peoples least able to bear the burden. Infectious diseases-of which the novel coronavirus is just the latest arrival-kill millions of people in poorer countries as the citizens of the richest nations shut their gates and hoard medicine and supplies. How is it even remotely fair to allocate citizenship in the world's nations by mere random chance when so much depends on which ticket one draws? 23 Rethinking the politics of birthright will not be easy. The roots of birthright belonging extend deep into the soil of the American political tradition. And as Schaub and Jones remind us, over the past two centuries we have gained a great deal, in terms of equality and inclusion, from the audacious grafting of democratic institutions onto a political community defined by birthright. But as the modern world of nation-states enters its third century and perhaps comes to its crisis, we will have to take a hard look at the birthright principle and decide if it is still right-if, indeed, we can still accept it. Should birth alone dictate so much about who we are? 24\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nBooks & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins\n\nElie Mystal\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nBooks & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins\n\nElie Mystal\n\nElie Mystal\n\nStarting in the mid-15th century, birthright politics took on a new form: the notion of race. As Schaub observes early in his book, the history of race is often flattened into a timeless and universal practice of differentiation based on how people look. But the idea of race, he insists, began as something else. It was not about appearance at all; in fact, early racial thought differentiated among groups that looked alike. Race was an ideology that sought to draw boundaries of political community through genealogy and birthright. By \"naturaliz[ing]\" forms of \"sociopolitical difference,\" it applied a new and pernicious patina to the age-old practice of inherited political status. 5 To make his argument, Schaub retells the story of the racialization of Jews in the Iberian Peninsula-which he sees as a key passage in the development of both racial thought and modern birthright politics. Starting in the eighth century, most of Iberia fell under the rule of a succession of Muslim states, which were content to let the region's large Jewish population exist in relative peace and autonomy. But as Christian kingdoms gradually conquered the peninsula during the Middle Ages, they and the Catholic Church sought to enforce religious conformity on their newly acquired lands. Jews were massacred or subjected to mass forced conversions. In 1492 the \"Catholic Monarchs\" Ferdinand and Isabella of Aragon and Castile completed the conquest and brought this process to its conclusion, forcing all of the remaining Jews to convert to Catholicism or leave. 6 Yet even as they were stamping out the last pockets of Judaism in Iberia, Spain's Old Christians, jealous of the social and political power they might lose to the new converts, were finding ways to perpetuate their outsider status. By the 1440s, Old Christians had formalized in law an early form of racial ideology that rested on a distinction between two kinds of otherness: Jewish belief and Jewishness. The Jewish faith could be washed away at the baptismal font. But Jewishness was something else altogether-a form of genealogical inferiority embedded in Jewish bodies. It passed from one generation to the next, and it was unalterable. Jews were a different people as well as a different faith. Although they could convert, they would retain their racial otherness (which was also invisible, since the conversos looked just like the Old Christians). 7 Current Issue View our current issue In the decades after their first contact with the Americas in 1492, Iberians and other Europeans carried this emerging racial ideology around the globe, creating an expansive portfolio of racializing theories to mark off many other groups as permanent outsiders. They increasingly imagined Native Americans and sub-Saharan Africans as distinct races, granting themselves license to take their lands and reduce their people to serfdom or slavery. Unlike the conversos , many of these populations had physical features, especially skin color, that created visible forms of distinction between them and Europeans. Though Europeans used these features to identify the members of the various \"races,\" their fundamental difference, they insisted, was genealogical-an inheritance from birth, as with the Jews of Iberia. 8 The racialization of non-Europeans in the Americas and Africa thus became an essential part of European efforts to draw lines of political exclusion within and around their empires, putting millions of people outside the circle of citizenship and, in some cases, outside the circle of humanity itself. Unlike other forms of identity and political membership, this birthright politics enfolded many Europeans, including women and even members of other religious groups, as natural-born members of a racial community. But it excluded many others and insisted that belonging was an immutable fact, lodging racial otherness in the body and making the boundaries between in-groups and out-groups permanent and unalterable. 9 This racialized logic of birthright, as Schaub observes, has remained latent in Western politics ever since, wielded by dominant groups over and over again as a way to slow down or stop the social and political ascent of subordinated communities. 10 W hen the United States emerged as an independent nation, it seemed to promise at least a partial break from the idea that political belonging should be the result of birth alone. Starting with their 1776 decision to disavow the British monarch, American revolutionaries insisted that theirs was a community of citizens who freely chose to be part of the nation. Their actions in subsequent decades gave some substance to those claims. The 1790 Naturalization Act, the new nation's first immigration law, let any free white person enter the country and become an American citizen more or less at will. Some US politicians even seemed inclined to accept the claim that citizens could expatriate themselves-that is, give up their citizenship. In 1795, Supreme Court Justice James Iredell even ruminated about whether expatriation was a \"natural, inalienable right\" that could not be limited or regulated by the state. 11 Related Article Julius Scott's Epic About Black Resistance in the Age of Revolution Manisha Sinha Yet status by birth entrenched itself in the politics of the new republic as well. A few exceptions aside, the nation's founders embraced a birthright notion of race not unlike that of the Spanish-which they then used to justify slavery and the denial of rights and citizenship to nonwhite people living in US territories. At the time of the American Revolution, roughly one out of every six inhabitants of the American colonies was an enslaved African. White Americans justified their status on the grounds that Africans were members of a different and inferior race, whose stain passed from generation to generation. 12 Members of the founding generation, eager to expand the white population of their new country, took an equally expansive view of the birthright principle's application to members of their racial group. David Ramsay, a South Carolina congressman and early theorist of US citizenship, believed that American citizens \"transmitted\" their citizenship to their children \"by inheritance.\" Before long, judges and legislators had extended this potent principle of hereditary citizenship to include any white person born to US citizens abroad and to white people born to noncitizens on American soil. 13 In Birthright Citizens , Jones explores how a small but significant free African American community tried to turn the young republic's birthright politics on its head, transforming a doctrine of exclusion and hierarchy into a means by which they could claim a place for themselves in American society. Free African Americans, like many people of color in the Atlantic world, were relentlessly pursued by the possibility that their race, not their status as free people, was their true birthright. The risks of exclusion or expulsion and the nightmare of reenslavement were a constant presence in their lives. Claiming American citizenship as an inalienable birthright was a crucial way for free African Americans to overcome these dangers-and, Jones argues, their claims had a lasting impact on the nature of citizenship for all Americans. 14 Baltimore was a center of these efforts by free African Americans to assert their inborn right to US citizenship, and Jones focuses her narrative on their story. As members of an old and relatively wealthy community, Baltimore's African Americans were well equipped to use the city's courts as a forum for demonstrating their citizenship by exercising the rights of free people. They sued fellow Baltimoreans of both races over matters great and small, from a debt of a few tens of dollars to control of a prosperous Methodist church and its property. These suits protected their property, but they also had symbolic value: Even an unsuccessful suit affirmed a litigant's status as a legal person. While in court, black litigants could, as Jones put it, become \"peers to their white counterparts.\" And the act of going to court, repeated year in and year out, could be used to make claims, however tenuous, about citizenship and equality. 15 But exercising one's rights in court proved to be a weak guarantor of African American citizenship. Throughout the antebellum period, in Baltimore and elsewhere, white legislators and jurists worked to reduce African Americans to the status of \"denizens,\" a category in English common law for individuals who were designated neither native nor foreign and occupied a middle ground between full membership and full exclusion. In Maryland alone, the state legislature heaped on law after law that sought to impose this second-class status on black people in the state. African Americans could not freely or easily leave the state, they could not vote, and they faced restrictions on owning firearms (though in practice, white judges in Baltimore routinely granted gun licenses to black men). African American citizenship, in short, was perpetually under assault. 16 Starting in the 1820s, Baltimore's African Americans found their citizenship status threatened in a new and frightening way by the so-called colonization movement. Colonization was a project, led by white Americans, that sought to empty the country of free people of color. Most proponents of colonization did not envision forcibly expelling free people of color but wanted them to leave of their own volition. Yet even if it was not backed by a threat of force, colonization posed an existential threat to African American citizenship: All such projects rested on the assumption that the true home of African Americans was somewhere else. When coupled with measures designed to make life in the United States difficult for free people of color, as it often was, colonization took on the sinister, coercive overtones of ethnic cleansing. 17 To counter the threat of colonization and other efforts to reduce them to the status of denizens, black Baltimoreans and their allies began to declare their citizenship an inalienable birthright. \"We are Americans, having a birthright citizenship,\" wrote the Pennsylvanian African American leader Martin Delany in 1852, and activists in Baltimore transformed this claim into their political creed. Inalienable citizenship was defined by the same birthbound language that was used to exclude them. In 1831, Baltimore's leading black citizens issued a declaration proclaiming themselves natives of the \"land in which we were born\" and insisting that it was thus their \"true and appropriate home.\" William Yates, a white activist whom Jones discusses at length, expanded on this notion in an 1838 treatise. Free people of color, he argued, were undoubtedly citizens because they were \"natives of the country.\" 18 These claims by black Baltimoreans began to resound forcefully beyond the city's borders in the run-up to the Civil War. The most striking illustration of their reach, curiously enough, came from the pen of a famous opponent of black citizenship, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Roger B. Taney. As a son of the city and a leading Maryland politician before joining the court, he was intimately familiar with the black Baltimoreans and their claims to US citizenship. Both were clearly on his mind in 1857 when he authored the court's notorious opinion in Dred Scott v. Sanford , an appeal of a freedom suit brought by an enslaved man from the Midwest. Going well beyond what was necessary to resolve the case presented to the court, Taney decided to use it as an opportunity to pronounce against African Americans' aspirations to citizenship in general. His opinion provided a decisive rebuff to black Baltimoreans' claims. African Americans, he baldly declared, were \"not citizens.\" The \"unhappy black race,\" he continued (in language that closely echoed the Iberians' more than four centuries earlier), \"were separated from the white by indelible marks.\" 19 Jones's book closes with a brief discussion of Reconstruction, which gives a tantalizing glimpse of the connections between African American claims to birthright citizenship in the antebellum period and the arguments about it after the Civil War that culminated in the 14th Amendment. The aftermath of the war saw a final struggle, played out across the country, to remove the persistent doubts about the citizenship status of former enslaved people and freeborn African Americans alike. The 14th Amendment, adopted in 1868, aimed to remove all ambiguity on this point by constitutionalizing the very principle of birthright citizenship that activists for African American rights had been hammering home for decades. \"All persons born...in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,\" the amendment states, \"are citizens of the United States.\" By the time this language was adopted, black Baltimoreans were no longer prophets in the wilderness: The idea of citizenship for African Americans had gained substantial acceptance in the North. But they were surely gratified to find their argument set, at long last, into the US Constitution. 20 I n the century and a half since its ratification, the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment has been without doubt a force for good, a powerful instrument for unambiguously confirming membership in the American nation.

David Ramsay, a South Carolina congressman and early theorist of US citizenship, believed that American citizens \"transmitted\" their citizenship to their children \"by inheritance.\" Before long, judges and legislators had extended this potent principle of hereditary citizenship to include any white person born to US citizens abroad and to white people born to noncitizens on American soil. 13 In Birthright Citizens , Jones explores how a small but significant free African American community tried to turn the young republic's birthright politics on its head, transforming a doctrine of exclusion and hierarchy into a means by which they could claim a place for themselves in American society. Free African Americans, like many people of color in the Atlantic world, were relentlessly pursued by the possibility that their race, not their status as free people, was their true birthright. The risks of exclusion or expulsion and the nightmare of reenslavement were a constant presence in their lives. Claiming American citizenship as an inalienable birthright was a crucial way for free African Americans to overcome these dangers-and, Jones argues, their claims had a lasting impact on the nature of citizenship for all Americans. 14 Baltimore was a center of these efforts by free African Americans to assert their inborn right to US citizenship, and Jones focuses her narrative on their story. As members of an old and relatively wealthy community, Baltimore's African Americans were well equipped to use the city's courts as a forum for demonstrating their citizenship by exercising the rights of free people. They sued fellow Baltimoreans of both races over matters great and small, from a debt of a few tens of dollars to control of a prosperous Methodist church and its property. These suits protected their property, but they also had symbolic value: Even an unsuccessful suit affirmed a litigant's status as a legal person. While in court, black litigants could, as Jones put it, become \"peers to their white counterparts.\" And the act of going to court, repeated year in and year out, could be used to make claims, however tenuous, about citizenship and equality. 15 But exercising one's rights in court proved to be a weak guarantor of African American citizenship. Throughout the antebellum period, in Baltimore and elsewhere, white legislators and jurists worked to reduce African Americans to the status of \"denizens,\" a category in English common law for individuals who were designated neither native nor foreign and occupied a middle ground between full membership and full exclusion. In Maryland alone, the state legislature heaped on law after law that sought to impose this second-class status on black people in the state. African Americans could not freely or easily leave the state, they could not vote, and they faced restrictions on owning firearms (though in practice, white judges in Baltimore routinely granted gun licenses to black men). African American citizenship, in short, was perpetually under assault. 16 Starting in the 1820s, Baltimore's African Americans found their citizenship status threatened in a new and frightening way by the so-called colonization movement. Colonization was a project, led by white Americans, that sought to empty the country of free people of color. Most proponents of colonization did not envision forcibly expelling free people of color but wanted them to leave of their own volition. Yet even if it was not backed by a threat of force, colonization posed an existential threat to African American citizenship: All such projects rested on the assumption that the true home of African Americans was somewhere else. When coupled with measures designed to make life in the United States difficult for free people of color, as it often was, colonization took on the sinister, coercive overtones of ethnic cleansing. 17 To counter the threat of colonization and other efforts to reduce them to the status of denizens, black Baltimoreans and their allies began to declare their citizenship an inalienable birthright. \"We are Americans, having a birthright citizenship,\" wrote the Pennsylvanian African American leader Martin Delany in 1852, and activists in Baltimore transformed this claim into their political creed. Inalienable citizenship was defined by the same birthbound language that was used to exclude them. In 1831, Baltimore's leading black citizens issued a declaration proclaiming themselves natives of the \"land in which we were born\" and insisting that it was thus their \"true and appropriate home.\" William Yates, a white activist whom Jones discusses at length, expanded on this notion in an 1838 treatise. Free people of color, he argued, were undoubtedly citizens because they were \"natives of the country.\" 18 These claims by black Baltimoreans began to resound forcefully beyond the city's borders in the run-up to the Civil War. The most striking illustration of their reach, curiously enough, came from the pen of a famous opponent of black citizenship, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Roger B. Taney. As a son of the city and a leading Maryland politician before joining the court, he was intimately familiar with the black Baltimoreans and their claims to US citizenship. Both were clearly on his mind in 1857 when he authored the court's notorious opinion in Dred Scott v. Sanford , an appeal of a freedom suit brought by an enslaved man from the Midwest. Going well beyond what was necessary to resolve the case presented to the court, Taney decided to use it as an opportunity to pronounce against African Americans' aspirations to citizenship in general. His opinion provided a decisive rebuff to black Baltimoreans' claims. African Americans, he baldly declared, were \"not citizens.\" The \"unhappy black race,\" he continued (in language that closely echoed the Iberians' more than four centuries earlier), \"were separated from the white by indelible marks.\" 19 Jones's book closes with a brief discussion of Reconstruction, which gives a tantalizing glimpse of the connections between African American claims to birthright citizenship in the antebellum period and the arguments about it after the Civil War that culminated in the 14th Amendment. The aftermath of the war saw a final struggle, played out across the country, to remove the persistent doubts about the citizenship status of former enslaved people and freeborn African Americans alike. The 14th Amendment, adopted in 1868, aimed to remove all ambiguity on this point by constitutionalizing the very principle of birthright citizenship that activists for African American rights had been hammering home for decades. \"All persons born...in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,\" the amendment states, \"are citizens of the United States.\" By the time this language was adopted, black Baltimoreans were no longer prophets in the wilderness: The idea of citizenship for African Americans had gained substantial acceptance in the North. But they were surely gratified to find their argument set, at long last, into the US Constitution. 20 I n the century and a half since its ratification, the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment has been without doubt a force for good, a powerful instrument for unambiguously confirming membership in the American nation. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, in the face of virulent anti-Chinese racism, the clause guaranteed the citizenship of individuals born to Chinese parents on US soil. It did likewise for the children of Eastern and Southern European immigrants who came to the United States in the early 20th century, and in more recent times, it has extended citizenship to the American-born children of undocumented immigrants from Latin America and other regions. 21 Yet as Schaub's historical genealogy of racial thought reminds us, there is a flip side to this coin. Like the idea of race to which it is sometimes opposed, the birthright principle works through inheritance, passing status from parent to child as if it were an innate quality in a bloodline. It can also confer the same status based on the accident of where one is born. In either case, the birthright principle distributes citizenship's privileges and blessings by chance rather than in accordance with any higher principle of justice. In practice, this means equality for some is bought at the price of arbitrary exclusion for many. 22 For much of the recent past, Americans have uncritically accepted the bargain we have struck between these two faces of the birthright principle. The benefits of inclusion have seemed to far outweigh its exclusionary, illiberal mechanism for deciding who is in and who is out. But in our age of global inequality, it is clear the arbitrary belonging created by birthright politics is no longer adequate to our moment. Globally, the distribution of wealth among the world's countries has reached unprecedented levels of inequality and continues to grow more extreme. The negative externalities of runaway consumption, above all climate change and its effects, are falling hardest on the countries and peoples least able to bear the burden. Infectious diseases-of which the novel coronavirus is just the latest arrival-kill millions of people in poorer countries as the citizens of the richest nations shut their gates and hoard medicine and supplies. How is it even remotely fair to allocate citizenship in the world's nations by mere random chance when so much depends on which ticket one draws? 23 Rethinking the politics of birthright will not be easy. The roots of birthright belonging extend deep into the soil of the American political tradition. And as Schaub and Jones remind us, over the past two centuries we have gained a great deal, in terms of equality and inclusion, from the audacious grafting of democratic institutions onto a political community defined by birthright. But as the modern world of nation-states enters its third century and perhaps comes to its crisis, we will have to take a hard look at the birthright principle and decide if it is still right-if, indeed, we can still accept it. Should birth alone dictate so much about who we are? 24\n\nIn the decades after their first contact with the Americas in 1492, Iberians and other Europeans carried this emerging racial ideology around the globe, creating an expansive portfolio of racializing theories to mark off many other groups as permanent outsiders. They increasingly imagined Native Americans and sub-Saharan Africans as distinct races, granting themselves license to take their lands and reduce their people to serfdom or slavery. Unlike the conversos , many of these populations had physical features, especially skin color, that created visible forms of distinction between them and Europeans. Though Europeans used these features to identify the members of the various \"races,\" their fundamental difference, they insisted, was genealogical-an inheritance from birth, as with the Jews of Iberia. 8 The racialization of non-Europeans in the Americas and Africa thus became an essential part of European efforts to draw lines of political exclusion within and around their empires, putting millions of people outside the circle of citizenship and, in some cases, outside the circle of humanity itself. Unlike other forms of identity and political membership, this birthright politics enfolded many Europeans, including women and even members of other religious groups, as natural-born members of a racial community. But it excluded many others and insisted that belonging was an immutable fact, lodging racial otherness in the body and making the boundaries between in-groups and out-groups permanent and unalterable. 9 This racialized logic of birthright, as Schaub observes, has remained latent in Western politics ever since, wielded by dominant groups over and over again as a way to slow down or stop the social and political ascent of subordinated communities. 10 W hen the United States emerged as an independent nation, it seemed to promise at least a partial break from the idea that political belonging should be the result of birth alone. Starting with their 1776 decision to disavow the British monarch, American revolutionaries insisted that theirs was a community of citizens who freely chose to be part of the nation. Their actions in subsequent decades gave some substance to those claims. The 1790 Naturalization Act, the new nation's first immigration law, let any free white person enter the country and become an American citizen more or less at will. Some US politicians even seemed inclined to accept the claim that citizens could expatriate themselves-that is, give up their citizenship. In 1795, Supreme Court Justice James Iredell even ruminated about whether expatriation was a \"natural, inalienable right\" that could not be limited or regulated by the state. 11 Related Article Julius Scott's Epic About Black Resistance in the Age of Revolution Manisha Sinha Yet status by birth entrenched itself in the politics of the new republic as well. A few exceptions aside, the nation's founders embraced a birthright notion of race not unlike that of the Spanish-which they then used to justify slavery and the denial of rights and citizenship to nonwhite people living in US territories.

David Ramsay, a South Carolina congressman and early theorist of US citizenship, believed that American citizens \"transmitted\" their citizenship to their children \"by inheritance.\" Before long, judges and legislators had extended this potent principle of hereditary citizenship to include any white person born to US citizens abroad and to white people born to noncitizens on American soil. 13 In Birthright Citizens , Jones explores how a small but significant free African American community tried to turn the young republic's birthright politics on its head, transforming a doctrine of exclusion and hierarchy into a means by which they could claim a place for themselves in American society. Free African Americans, like many people of color in the Atlantic world, were relentlessly pursued by the possibility that their race, not their status as free people, was their true birthright. The risks of exclusion or expulsion and the nightmare of reenslavement were a constant presence in their lives. Claiming American citizenship as an inalienable birthright was a crucial way for free African Americans to overcome these dangers-and, Jones argues, their claims had a lasting impact on the nature of citizenship for all Americans. 14 Baltimore was a center of these efforts by free African Americans to assert their inborn right to US citizenship, and Jones focuses her narrative on their story. As members of an old and relatively wealthy community, Baltimore's African Americans were well equipped to use the city's courts as a forum for demonstrating their citizenship by exercising the rights of free people. They sued fellow Baltimoreans of both races over matters great and small, from a debt of a few tens of dollars to control of a prosperous Methodist church and its property. These suits protected their property, but they also had symbolic value: Even an unsuccessful suit affirmed a litigant's status as a legal person. While in court, black litigants could, as Jones put it, become \"peers to their white counterparts.\" And the act of going to court, repeated year in and year out, could be used to make claims, however tenuous, about citizenship and equality. 15 But exercising one's rights in court proved to be a weak guarantor of African American citizenship. Throughout the antebellum period, in Baltimore and elsewhere, white legislators and jurists worked to reduce African Americans to the status of \"denizens,\" a category in English common law for individuals who were designated neither native nor foreign and occupied a middle ground between full membership and full exclusion. In Maryland alone, the state legislature heaped on law after law that sought to impose this second-class status on black people in the state. African Americans could not freely or easily leave the state, they could not vote, and they faced restrictions on owning firearms (though in practice, white judges in Baltimore routinely granted gun licenses to black men). African American citizenship, in short, was perpetually under assault. 16 Starting in the 1820s, Baltimore's African Americans found their citizenship status threatened in a new and frightening way by the so-called colonization movement. Colonization was a project, led by white Americans, that sought to empty the country of free people of color. Most proponents of colonization did not envision forcibly expelling free people of color but wanted them to leave of their own volition. Yet even if it was not backed by a threat of force, colonization posed an existential threat to African American citizenship: All such projects rested on the assumption that the true home of African Americans was somewhere else. When coupled with measures designed to make life in the United States difficult for free people of color, as it often was, colonization took on the sinister, coercive overtones of ethnic cleansing. 17 To counter the threat of colonization and other efforts to reduce them to the status of denizens, black Baltimoreans and their allies began to declare their citizenship an inalienable birthright. \"We are Americans, having a birthright citizenship,\" wrote the Pennsylvanian African American leader Martin Delany in 1852, and activists in Baltimore transformed this claim into their political creed. Inalienable citizenship was defined by the same birthbound language that was used to exclude them. In 1831, Baltimore's leading black citizens issued a declaration proclaiming themselves natives of the \"land in which we were born\" and insisting that it was thus their \"true and appropriate home.\" William Yates, a white activist whom Jones discusses at length, expanded on this notion in an 1838 treatise. Free people of color, he argued, were undoubtedly citizens because they were \"natives of the country.\" 18 These claims by black Baltimoreans began to resound forcefully beyond the city's borders in the run-up to the Civil War. The most striking illustration of their reach, curiously enough, came from the pen of a famous opponent of black citizenship, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Roger B. Taney. As a son of the city and a leading Maryland politician before joining the court, he was intimately familiar with the black Baltimoreans and their claims to US citizenship. Both were clearly on his mind in 1857 when he authored the court's notorious opinion in Dred Scott v. Sanford , an appeal of a freedom suit brought by an enslaved man from the Midwest. Going well beyond what was necessary to resolve the case presented to the court, Taney decided to use it as an opportunity to pronounce against African Americans' aspirations to citizenship in general. His opinion provided a decisive rebuff to black Baltimoreans' claims. African Americans, he baldly declared, were \"not citizens.\" The \"unhappy black race,\" he continued (in language that closely echoed the Iberians' more than four centuries earlier), \"were separated from the white by indelible marks.\" 19 Jones's book closes with a brief discussion of Reconstruction, which gives a tantalizing glimpse of the connections between African American claims to birthright citizenship in the antebellum period and the arguments about it after the Civil War that culminated in the 14th Amendment. The aftermath of the war saw a final struggle, played out across the country, to remove the persistent doubts about the citizenship status of former enslaved people and freeborn African Americans alike. The 14th Amendment, adopted in 1868, aimed to remove all ambiguity on this point by constitutionalizing the very principle of birthright citizenship that activists for African American rights had been hammering home for decades. \"All persons born...in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,\" the amendment states, \"are citizens of the United States.\" By the time this language was adopted, black Baltimoreans were no longer prophets in the wilderness: The idea of citizenship for African Americans had gained substantial acceptance in the North. But they were surely gratified to find their argument set, at long last, into the US Constitution. 20 I n the century and a half since its ratification, the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment has been without doubt a force for good, a powerful instrument for unambiguously confirming membership in the American nation. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, in the face of virulent anti-Chinese racism, the clause guaranteed the citizenship of individuals born to Chinese parents on US soil. It did likewise for the children of Eastern and Southern European immigrants who came to the United States in the early 20th century, and in more recent times, it has extended citizenship to the American-born children of undocumented immigrants from Latin America and other regions. 21 Yet as Schaub's historical genealogy of racial thought reminds us, there is a flip side to this coin. Like the idea of race to which it is sometimes opposed, the birthright principle works through inheritance, passing status from parent to child as if it were an innate quality in a bloodline. It can also confer the same status based on the accident of where one is born. In either case, the birthright principle distributes citizenship's privileges and blessings by chance rather than in accordance with any higher principle of justice. In practice, this means equality for some is bought at the price of arbitrary exclusion for many. 22 For much of the recent past, Americans have uncritically accepted the bargain we have struck between these two faces of the birthright principle. The benefits of inclusion have seemed to far outweigh its exclusionary, illiberal mechanism for deciding who is in and who is out. But in our age of global inequality, it is clear the arbitrary belonging created by birthright politics is no longer adequate to our moment. Globally, the distribution of wealth among the world's countries has reached unprecedented levels of inequality and continues to grow more extreme. The negative externalities of runaway consumption, above all climate change and its effects, are falling hardest on the countries and peoples least able to bear the burden. Infectious diseases-of which the novel coronavirus is just the latest arrival-kill millions of people in poorer countries as the citizens of the richest nations shut their gates and hoard medicine and supplies. How is it even remotely fair to allocate citizenship in the world's nations by mere random chance when so much depends on which ticket one draws? 23 Rethinking the politics of birthright will not be easy. The roots of birthright belonging extend deep into the soil of the American political tradition. And as Schaub and Jones remind us, over the past two centuries we have gained a great deal, in terms of equality and inclusion, from the audacious grafting of democratic institutions onto a political community defined by birthright. But as the modern world of nation-states enters its third century and perhaps comes to its crisis, we will have to take a hard look at the birthright principle and decide if it is still right-if, indeed, we can still accept it. Should birth alone dictate so much about who we are? 24\n\nW hen the United States emerged as an independent nation, it seemed to promise at least a partial break from the idea that political belonging should be the result of birth alone. Starting with their 1776 decision to disavow the British monarch, American revolutionaries insisted that theirs was a community of citizens who freely chose to be part of the nation. Their actions in subsequent decades gave some substance to those claims. The 1790 Naturalization Act, the new nation's first immigration law, let any free white person enter the country and become an American citizen more or less at will. Some US politicians even seemed inclined to accept the claim that citizens could expatriate themselves-that is, give up their citizenship. In 1795, Supreme Court Justice James Iredell even ruminated about whether expatriation was a \"natural, inalienable right\" that could not be limited or regulated by the state. 11 Related Article Julius Scott's Epic About Black Resistance in the Age of Revolution Manisha Sinha Yet status by birth entrenched itself in the politics of the new republic as well. A few exceptions aside, the nation's founders embraced a birthright notion of race not unlike that of the Spanish-which they then used to justify slavery and the denial of rights and citizenship to nonwhite people living in US territories.

African Americans, he baldly declared, were \"not citizens.\" The \"unhappy black race,\" he continued (in language that closely echoed the Iberians' more than four centuries earlier), \"were separated from the white by indelible marks.\" 19 Jones's book closes with a brief discussion of Reconstruction, which gives a tantalizing glimpse of the connections between African American claims to birthright citizenship in the antebellum period and the arguments about it after the Civil War that culminated in the 14th Amendment. The aftermath of the war saw a final struggle, played out across the country, to remove the persistent doubts about the citizenship status of former enslaved people and freeborn African Americans alike. The 14th Amendment, adopted in 1868, aimed to remove all ambiguity on this point by constitutionalizing the very principle of birthright citizenship that activists for African American rights had been hammering home for decades. \"All persons born...in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,\" the amendment states, \"are citizens of the United States.\" By the time this language was adopted, black Baltimoreans were no longer prophets in the wilderness: The idea of citizenship for African Americans had gained substantial acceptance in the North. But they were surely gratified to find their argument set, at long last, into the US Constitution. 20 I n the century and a half since its ratification, the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment has been without doubt a force for good, a powerful instrument for unambiguously confirming membership in the American nation. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, in the face of virulent anti-Chinese racism, the clause guaranteed the citizenship of individuals born to Chinese parents on US soil. It did likewise for the children of Eastern and Southern European immigrants who came to the United States in the early 20th century, and in more recent times, it has extended citizenship to the American-born children of undocumented immigrants from Latin America and other regions. 21 Yet as Schaub's historical genealogy of racial thought reminds us, there is a flip side to this coin. Like the idea of race to which it is sometimes opposed, the birthright principle works through inheritance, passing status from parent to child as if it were an innate quality in a bloodline. It can also confer the same status based on the accident of where one is born. In either case, the birthright principle distributes citizenship's privileges and blessings by chance rather than in accordance with any higher principle of justice. In practice, this means equality for some is bought at the price of arbitrary exclusion for many. 22 For much of the recent past, Americans have uncritically accepted the bargain we have struck between these two faces of the birthright principle. The benefits of inclusion have seemed to far outweigh its exclusionary, illiberal mechanism for deciding who is in and who is out. But in our age of global inequality, it is clear the arbitrary belonging created by birthright politics is no longer adequate to our moment. Globally, the distribution of wealth among the world's countries has reached unprecedented levels of inequality and continues to grow more extreme. The negative externalities of runaway consumption, above all climate change and its effects, are falling hardest on the countries and peoples least able to bear the burden. Infectious diseases-of which the novel coronavirus is just the latest arrival-kill millions of people in poorer countries as the citizens of the richest nations shut their gates and hoard medicine and supplies. How is it even remotely fair to allocate citizenship in the world's nations by mere random chance when so much depends on which ticket one draws? 23 Rethinking the politics of birthright will not be easy. The roots of birthright belonging extend deep into the soil of the American political tradition. And as Schaub and Jones remind us, over the past two centuries we have gained a great deal, in terms of equality and inclusion, from the audacious grafting of democratic institutions onto a political community defined by birthright. But as the modern world of nation-states enters its third century and perhaps comes to its crisis, we will have to take a hard look at the birthright principle and decide if it is still right-if, indeed, we can still accept it. Should birth alone dictate so much about who we are? 24\n\nIn Birthright Citizens , Jones explores how a small but significant free African American community tried to turn the young republic's birthright politics on its head, transforming a doctrine of exclusion and hierarchy into a means by which they could claim a place for themselves in American society. Free African Americans, like many people of color in the Atlantic world, were relentlessly pursued by the possibility that their race, not their status as free people, was their true birthright. The risks of exclusion or expulsion and the nightmare of reenslavement were a constant presence in their lives. Claiming American citizenship as an inalienable birthright was a crucial way for free African Americans to overcome these dangers-and, Jones argues, their claims had a lasting impact on the nature of citizenship for all Americans. 14 Baltimore was a center of these efforts by free African Americans to assert their inborn right to US citizenship, and Jones focuses her narrative on their story. As members of an old and relatively wealthy community, Baltimore's African Americans were well equipped to use the city's courts as a forum for demonstrating their citizenship by exercising the rights of free people. They sued fellow Baltimoreans of both races over matters great and small, from a debt of a few tens of dollars to control of a prosperous Methodist church and its property. These suits protected their property, but they also had symbolic value: Even an unsuccessful suit affirmed a litigant's status as a legal person. While in court, black litigants could, as Jones put it, become \"peers to their white counterparts.\" And the act of going to court, repeated year in and year out, could be used to make claims, however tenuous, about citizenship and equality. 15 But exercising one's rights in court proved to be a weak guarantor of African American citizenship. Throughout the antebellum period, in Baltimore and elsewhere, white legislators and jurists worked to reduce African Americans to the status of \"denizens,\" a category in English common law for individuals who were designated neither native nor foreign and occupied a middle ground between full membership and full exclusion. In Maryland alone, the state legislature heaped on law after law that sought to impose this second-class status on black people in the state. African Americans could not freely or easily leave the state, they could not vote, and they faced restrictions on owning firearms (though in practice, white judges in Baltimore routinely granted gun licenses to black men). African American citizenship, in short, was perpetually under assault. 16 Starting in the 1820s, Baltimore's African Americans found their citizenship status threatened in a new and frightening way by the so-called colonization movement. Colonization was a project, led by white Americans, that sought to empty the country of free people of color. Most proponents of colonization did not envision forcibly expelling free people of color but wanted them to leave of their own volition. Yet even if it was not backed by a threat of force, colonization posed an existential threat to African American citizenship: All such projects rested on the assumption that the true home of African Americans was somewhere else. When coupled with measures designed to make life in the United States difficult for free people of color, as it often was, colonization took on the sinister, coercive overtones of ethnic cleansing. 17 To counter the threat of colonization and other efforts to reduce them to the status of denizens, black Baltimoreans and their allies began to declare their citizenship an inalienable birthright. \"We are Americans, having a birthright citizenship,\" wrote the Pennsylvanian African American leader Martin Delany in 1852, and activists in Baltimore transformed this claim into their political creed. Inalienable citizenship was defined by the same birthbound language that was used to exclude them. In 1831, Baltimore's leading black citizens issued a declaration proclaiming themselves natives of the \"land in which we were born\" and insisting that it was thus their \"true and appropriate home.\" William Yates, a white activist whom Jones discusses at length, expanded on this notion in an 1838 treatise. Free people of color, he argued, were undoubtedly citizens because they were \"natives of the country.\" 18 These claims by black Baltimoreans began to resound forcefully beyond the city's borders in the run-up to the Civil War. The most striking illustration of their reach, curiously enough, came from the pen of a famous opponent of black citizenship, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Roger B. Taney. As a son of the city and a leading Maryland politician before joining the court, he was intimately familiar with the black Baltimoreans and their claims to US citizenship. Both were clearly on his mind in 1857 when he authored the court's notorious opinion in Dred Scott v. Sanford , an appeal of a freedom suit brought by an enslaved man from the Midwest.

Free people of color, he argued, were undoubtedly citizens because they were \"natives of the country.\" 18 These claims by black Baltimoreans began to resound forcefully beyond the city's borders in the run-up to the Civil War. The most striking illustration of their reach, curiously enough, came from the pen of a famous opponent of black citizenship, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Roger B. Taney. As a son of the city and a leading Maryland politician before joining the court, he was intimately familiar with the black Baltimoreans and their claims to US citizenship. Both were clearly on his mind in 1857 when he authored the court's notorious opinion in Dred Scott v. Sanford , an appeal of a freedom suit brought by an enslaved man from the Midwest. Going well beyond what was necessary to resolve the case presented to the court, Taney decided to use it as an opportunity to pronounce against African Americans' aspirations to citizenship in general. His opinion provided a decisive rebuff to black Baltimoreans' claims. African Americans, he baldly declared, were \"not citizens.\" The \"unhappy black race,\" he continued (in language that closely echoed the Iberians' more than four centuries earlier), \"were separated from the white by indelible marks.\" 19 Jones's book closes with a brief discussion of Reconstruction, which gives a tantalizing glimpse of the connections between African American claims to birthright citizenship in the antebellum period and the arguments about it after the Civil War that culminated in the 14th Amendment. The aftermath of the war saw a final struggle, played out across the country, to remove the persistent doubts about the citizenship status of former enslaved people and freeborn African Americans alike. The 14th Amendment, adopted in 1868, aimed to remove all ambiguity on this point by constitutionalizing the very principle of birthright citizenship that activists for African American rights had been hammering home for decades. \"All persons born...in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,\" the amendment states, \"are citizens of the United States.\" By the time this language was adopted, black Baltimoreans were no longer prophets in the wilderness: The idea of citizenship for African Americans had gained substantial acceptance in the North. But they were surely gratified to find their argument set, at long last, into the US Constitution. 20 I n the century and a half since its ratification, the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment has been without doubt a force for good, a powerful instrument for unambiguously confirming membership in the American nation. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, in the face of virulent anti-Chinese racism, the clause guaranteed the citizenship of individuals born to Chinese parents on US soil. It did likewise for the children of Eastern and Southern European immigrants who came to the United States in the early 20th century, and in more recent times, it has extended citizenship to the American-born children of undocumented immigrants from Latin America and other regions. 21 Yet as Schaub's historical genealogy of racial thought reminds us, there is a flip side to this coin. Like the idea of race to which it is sometimes opposed, the birthright principle works through inheritance, passing status from parent to child as if it were an innate quality in a bloodline. It can also confer the same status based on the accident of where one is born. In either case, the birthright principle distributes citizenship's privileges and blessings by chance rather than in accordance with any higher principle of justice. In practice, this means equality for some is bought at the price of arbitrary exclusion for many. 22 For much of the recent past, Americans have uncritically accepted the bargain we have struck between these two faces of the birthright principle. The benefits of inclusion have seemed to far outweigh its exclusionary, illiberal mechanism for deciding who is in and who is out. But in our age of global inequality, it is clear the arbitrary belonging created by birthright politics is no longer adequate to our moment. Globally, the distribution of wealth among the world's countries has reached unprecedented levels of inequality and continues to grow more extreme. The negative externalities of runaway consumption, above all climate change and its effects, are falling hardest on the countries and peoples least able to bear the burden. Infectious diseases-of which the novel coronavirus is just the latest arrival-kill millions of people in poorer countries as the citizens of the richest nations shut their gates and hoard medicine and supplies. How is it even remotely fair to allocate citizenship in the world's nations by mere random chance when so much depends on which ticket one draws? 23 Rethinking the politics of birthright will not be easy. The roots of birthright belonging extend deep into the soil of the American political tradition. And as Schaub and Jones remind us, over the past two centuries we have gained a great deal, in terms of equality and inclusion, from the audacious grafting of democratic institutions onto a political community defined by birthright. But as the modern world of nation-states enters its third century and perhaps comes to its crisis, we will have to take a hard look at the birthright principle and decide if it is still right-if, indeed, we can still accept it. Should birth alone dictate so much about who we are? 24\n\nThese claims by black Baltimoreans began to resound forcefully beyond the city's borders in the run-up to the Civil War.

(Getty / John Deakin)\n\nHad Peter Abrahams, the South African-born novelist, journalist, and Pan-Africanist, not been killed tragically in his Jamaican home in January 2017, he would have celebrated his 100th birthday this year. Born in 1919 on the outskirts of Johannesburg to an Ethiopian father and a \"colored\" (in the parlance of apartheid) mother, Abrahams lived his life along the winding paths of Pan-Africanism in the 20th century. In the same year that Abrahams was born, W.E.B. Du Bois helped organize the First Pan-African Congress to lay out a vision of what the end of the \"war to end all wars\" might mean for the colonized and Jim Crowed, who had long been subjugated by empire and white supremacy. When the end of another world war spurred the creation of the United Nations in 1945, Abrahams was old enough to join in the Pan-Africanists' Fifth Congress, serving as its secretary of publicity. By that time, he had escaped South Africa after being accused of treason for criticizing his country's inequalities and had established himself as a writer with the publication of the short story collection Dark Testament and the novel Song of the City . At the Fifth Congress, he was joined by a cohort of black intellectuals-Amy Ashwood Garvey, Jomo Kenyatta, Kwame Nkrumah, George Padmore-who would soon define the coming postcolonial era. \"The struggle for political power by Colonial and subject peoples,\" the congress declared, \"is the first step towards, and the necessary prerequisite to, complete social, economic and political emancipation.\" Current Issue View our current issue Reflecting on the proceedings, Abrahams identified this call with a new \"militant phase\" of the struggle against colonialism. \"Forward to the Socialist United States of Africa! Long live Pan-Africanism!\" he exhorted after the congress's closing. To Du Bois's 1900 declaration that \"the problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line,\" Abrahams and his generation answered with a vision of an independent and united Africa that could finally secure racial equality across the globe. However, Abrahams's story also mirrored the swift disillusion that followed with the emergence of neocolonialism and the fractures within the Pan-Africanist movement. In his prescient 1956 novel A Wreath for Udomo , he depicted the unraveling of Pan-Africanism just as it was becoming a wide-ranging movement. The book's main character, Michael Udomo, is a composite figure (based on Nkrumah and Padmore) who moves from organizing for African independence in London to becoming the prime minister of a fictional \"Panafrica.\" Narrated in two parts, \"The Dream\" and \"The Reality,\" the novel tracks the exhilarating promise of national liberation, the hopes of a militant generation of Pan-Africanists, and the tragic choice that follows as Udomo weighs the costs of betraying the cause by accepting aid from a white settler nation or risking the ire of powerful states by supporting a fellow revolutionary. His dilemmas culminate in his destruction at the hands of his domestic opposition. Books in Review Pan-Africanism: A History By Hakim Adi Buy this book In the years to come, numerous anticolonial activists-from Nkrumah in Ghana to Ahmed Ben Bella in Algeria and Patrice Lumumba in Congo-would meet a similar fate, witnessing their hopes for independence dashed in the face of domestic dissension, Cold War interventions, and persistent economic dependence. In an age of decolonization, the Pan-Africanist wager was premised on the view that nationalism and internationalism must go hand in hand, that national independence could be secured only within regional and international institutions. As a result, the early postcolonial constitutions of Ghana, Guinea, and Mali, for instance, included clauses that authorized the delegation of sovereignty to a Union of African States when such an entity came into being. Yet over the three decades that followed World War II, internationalism and nationalism gradually came apart. While the sovereign state proved to be a limited vehicle for realizing independence and equality, its rights of nonintervention and territorial integrity emerged as powerful tools, especially against domestic critics and subnational challenges to state authority. In this context, committed Pan-Africanists and internationalists soon became wedded to the sovereign nation-state and its capacity to discipline newly independent and fragile societies.

A chance meeting in 1955 with Norman Manley, who was then leading Jamaica's anticolonial struggle, prompted Abrahams to move to the island, where he participated in its transition to independence and later supported the social transformation inaugurated by Norman Manley's son Michael Manley, the democratic socialist prime minister who swept into office in 1972. Abrahams worked as the chairman of Radio Jamaica and hoped that the Caribbean might realize the democratic, egalitarian, and internationalist vision of society that he had long fought for. From his home in the mountains of Jamaica, Abrahams set his sights across the Atlantic, critically assessing the failures of the postcolonial African states and especially the rise of authoritarian regimes. But as he declared near the end of his long life, \"Jamaica is Africa to me.\" The story of Pan-Africanism as a cresting wave of 20th century aspirations for African freedom and unity that crashed on the limits of postcolonial statehood is compelling because it attends to the defeats and disappointments that followed decolonization. Yet it is only one story of Pan-Africanism, and it renders invisible and illegible those projects of African unity that circumvented the aspiration to statehood and persisted in alternative institutional and ideological trajectories. Throughout his life, Abrahams used his novels to restage and recast Pan-Africanism's promise of black freedom. In his last novel, The View From Coyaba , published in 1985, he offered a transnational and transhistorical story that begins in Jamaica before the abolition of slavery there and follows the life of Jacob Brown, a Maroon descendant who studies with Du Bois in the United States before traveling to Africa as a missionary. Forced to flee Uganda, Brown returns to the hills of Jamaica, where his ancestors once took flight from slavery. Rather than see his return as marking a full circle, Brown awaits another opportunity to fly back to Africa. Driven by a similar impulse toward historical recovery, Hakim Adi's recent book Pan-Africanism: A History situates the tragedies of mid-20th-century Pan-Africanism in a longer and more capacious history. Pan-Africanism, he shows, began in the 18th century with the struggle against slavery and has persisted well into the 21st century with, among other movements, contemporary reparations activism. Rather than a crashing wave, Adi argues, Pan-Africanism \"might be more usefully viewed as one river with many streams and currents.\" It flowed and ebbed and then flowed (and ebbed) again, helping to shape much of the 20th century in the process and continuing to leave a deep imprint on the 21st. Few scholars are better positioned than Adi to chart Pan-Africanism's history: Over the course of two decades, he has chronicled it and the modern black experience more broadly as the writer or editor of 11 books, not to mention many journal articles and chapters written for other books. In Pan-Africanism , he brings to bear his encyclopedic knowledge of black freedom movements in Africa, the Americas, and Europe. A di opens his book with the history of the transatlantic slave trade and the black struggles for emancipation that arose from it. The forced migration of 12 million people across the Atlantic as chattel, he argues, created the conditions in which \"Africa\" became a transnational marker-an idea as much as a place. In this context, Olaudah Equiano, born in what is now the Igbo region of Nigeria in 1745 and enslaved at a young age, styled himself the \"African\" in his 1789 Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano . With fellow freedman Ottobah Cugoano he organized the Sons of Africa, a group that agitated for the end of the slave trade. From the communities of escaped slaves that dotted the Americas and the early repatriation movements to the emergence of a \"black empire\" in the Haitian Revolution, the image of Pan-Africa began to take shape. But as Adi shows, if Pan-Africa was born out of the experience of diasporic bondage, it was not a unidirectional transmission from the enslaved and the colonized in the Americas to Africa. The transatlantic idea of Africa also took inspiration from the connections formed between these communities and the Africans still on the continent. For instance, the vision of \"African regeneration\" articulated by Edward Blyden, the Caribbean author of 1857's A Vindication of the Negro Race, who eventually settled in Liberia, inspired a whole cohort of West African intellectuals-J.E. Casely Hayford, John Mensah Sarbah, and Mojola Agbebi among them-who demanded reforms to the British Empire on the basis of West African solidarity. Reversing this trajectory of influence, the writings of James Africanus Horton, a Sierra Leonean doctor who supported and extended Blyden's vision, proved an important source for the Jamaican Marcus Garvey, whose group the Universal Negro Improvement Association would become the largest black mass movement in the world. At its height in the 1920s, UNIA had almost 1,000 chapters and divisions in Africa, the Caribbean, South and Central America, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Garvey's Black Star Line, a shipping company that sought to cultivate commercial links among black people, was likely modeled on the efforts of Chief Alfred Sam, a trader from the Gold Coast (now Ghana) who registered a company in New York to develop trade routes and encourage black emigration to Africa.

Seyla Benhabib Ta-Nehisi Coates's Narratives of Freedom Elias Rodriques Jill Lepore's Liberal Gospel Daniel Immerwahr Throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries, black people moved around the world in search of work and greater freedom, and through this they generated solidarities out of the collective experience of racialized slavery and colonialism, turning forced displacement and exile into political possibility. Meetings like the 1900 Pan-African Conference and its successors might suggest that these forms of mobility were limited to a small male elite. But as Adi highlights, the official spaces of Pan-Africanism relied on women's labor, even if women were marginalized. The 1900 conference, best remembered for Du Bois's evocative formulation of the global color line, was in fact co-organized by Alice Victoria Kinloch of South Africa, who emerged as a critic of black oppression in her homeland before moving to Britain in 1896. Garvey's wives Amy Ashwood and Amy Jacques, as well as Garveyite women like Mamie De Mena and Henrietta Vinton Davis, also contributed to the successful expansion of UNIA as they advanced women's causes within the organization. The Martinican sisters Paulette and Jane Nardal, as students in Paris during the 1920s, convened gatherings of black students and exiles and helped black print culture to proliferate. In an article for the inaugural issue of La Dépêche Africaine ( The African Dispatch ), Jane Nardal articulated the emergence of a new \" Internationalisme Noir \" (Black Internationalism). \"Blacks of all origins and nationalities, with different customs and religions,\" she argued, \"vaguely sense that they belong in spite of everything to a single and same race.... From now on there will be a certain interest, a certain originality, a certain pride in being black, in turning back towards Africa, cradle of the blacks, in recalling a common origin.\" Outside the rarefied conferences and chance meetings in imperial metropoles like London and Paris, the vision of a global Africa was lived and enacted in everyday life and culture by millions who remain anonymous to history. The idea of African freedom and unity traveled with the Caribbean workers who dug the Panama Canal. It was carried with the African Americans who escaped north in the Great Migration, and it traversed the African continent with figures like Abrahams's father, who traveled from his native Ethiopia to South Africa in order to find work in the mines and plantations of a voracious new imperialism. Black sailors and migrant workers in the circum-Caribbean and in southern Africa clandestinely distributed UNIA's newspaper, Negro World . The Comintern-funded Negro Worker , the Paris-based Le Cri des Nègres , and countless other black newspapers and magazines carried news of a global Africa along similar networks. After formal decolonization was achieved, the message of Pan-Africanism lived on in the vernaculars of Rastafarianism and reggae music, the aesthetics of the Afro, and the global reverberations of \"Black is beautiful.\" W eaving together the institutional high politics of Pan-Africanism with its popular and cultural iterations, Adi presents his readers with a wide tapestry of black freedom dreams that challenges many of the neat divisions imposed on black intellectual and political life by historians and scholars. For instance, much has been written about the differences between Du Bois's moderate calls for imperial reform at the early Pan-African congresses and Garvey's radical demand of \"Africa for the Africans.\" But as Adi shows, the two were united in their shared aspirations for black representation within the League of Nations, and figures like Kojo Tovalou Houénou of Dahomey (now Benin), who founded the Ligue Universelle Pour la Défense de la Race Noire (Universal League for the Defense of the Black Race), deftly navigated these two visions of Pan-Africanism. He attended UNIA meetings in New York and corresponded with Du Bois in the hope of positioning his own league as an umbrella Pan-African organization. For Houénou, Africa-not a particular territory or region-was his country, and the league sought to \"develop the bonds of solidarity and of universal brotherhood between all members of the black race; to bring them together for the restoration of their country of origin-Africa.\" Houénou's project, Adi tells us, was \"an aspiration that remained unrealized.\" Not only the efforts of imperial states to quash resistance and censor black publications but also internal differences of language, ideology, and orientation worked to fragment this and other efforts to consolidate and centralize Pan-Africanism. It is here that we begin to see the difficulties of viewing Pan-Africanism as one unvaried whole. Although Adi acknowledges different currents and streams, his river metaphor is too naturalistic to capture the disjuncture and disruption, the reformulation and rearticulation that characterized projects of African unity. Especially when he surveys the 1920s and '30s-arguably the high point of Pan-African cultural and political organizing-one finds the historical record replete with ephemeral organizations and publications and fleeting collaborations. Even following a single historical figure moves you through a half-dozen iterations of Pan-African politics. Take George Padmore. Born Malcolm Nurse in Arouca, Trinidad, in 1903, he began his political career by joining the Communist Party of the United States, where he lived as a student, and quickly emerged as a leading figure of the International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers and the editor of The Negro Worker from his base in Hamburg, Germany. Deported in 1933 by the Nazi police, then ousted from the party the following year for his criticism of Soviet alliances with colonial powers, Padmore briefly joined his fellow black communist Tiémoko Garan Kouyaté in Paris, where they planned a Negro World Unity congress. When growing repression and a lack of funding thwarted the group's founding, Padmore moved to London and, with fellow Trinidadian C.L.R. James, organized the International African Friends of Abyssinia (IAFA) in 1935 \"to assist by all means in their power in the maintenance of the territorial integrity and political independence of Abyssinia\" (now Ethiopia) as Italy threatened it with invasion. IAFA soon folded, however, and James and Padmore turned their efforts to a new organization, the International African Service Bureau, which would then serve as the basis for the Pan-African Federation, which organized the Fifth Pan-African Congress in 1945. Related Article When the Black Panthers Came to Algeria Elias Rodriques Writing of this interwar period, Brent Hayes Edwards has argued that the \"unforeseen alliances\" that diasporic blacks fostered \"also are characterized by unavoidable misapprehensions and misreadings, persistent blindnesses and solipsisms, self-defeating and abortive collaborations, a failure to translate even a basic grammar of blackness.\" This is not to say that visions of Pan-Africanism were futile from the outset but instead only to note the experimental and improvisational character of the projects taken up in its name and to acknowledge the linguistic, geographic, and ideological tensions against which Pan-Africanists labored. A ttending to the fragmentary quality of Pan-Africanism helps us make better sense of the discontinuities and reversals so presciently outlined in A Wreath for Udomo . The postwar phase of Pan-Africanism was unassimilable into a single movement or project, in part because the very premise of decolonization appeared to confine anticolonial activists to the territorially bound nation-state, undermining the transnational and nonterritorial scope of Pan-Africa. Following earlier histories of Pan-Africanism, Adi describes the shift of Pan-African activity from imperial metropoles to postcolonial Ghana and other newly independent states as the Pan-Africanists' \"return home.\" Yet such a reading narrows the scope of Pan-Africanism's internationalist ambitions; it becomes a black Zionism in search of a national homeland. To be sure, repatriation has always featured prominently in the African diasporic imagination, and so has the thirst for national independence. Reflecting in 1971 on The Black Jacobins , his classic 1938 history of the Haitian Revolution, James noted, \"It was written about Africa. It wasn't written about the Caribbean.\" Yet what mattered for him was not that Pan-Africanism might return home but that the Caribbean was the terrain on which African independence could be worked out. But even the achievement of African independence was not the end point, in his view. It was just the beginning of a global political and economic transformation-a world revolution that would simultaneously defeat white supremacy and capitalism. Nurturing a commitment to a Pan-Africa that exceeded a continental cartography, James was ambivalent about a politics that directed its energy primarily toward nation-state building and worried that despite the best intentions of the new generation of postcolonial statesmen, the trappings of state sovereignty would soon thwart their larger ambitions of securing African unity and building a racially egalitarian international order. The shift of Pan-African activity from imperial metropoles to the African continent and from international networks to postcolonial nation-states is perhaps Pan-Africanism's most contentious and uncertain moment-one that exposed the fragile suturing of difference and unity. The emergence of independent states like Ghana and Tanzania-led by two advocates of African socialism, Nkrumah and Julius Nyerere-created institutional and ideological openings to realize African unity. Yet the achievement of state sovereignty also worked to stymie more radical visions of Pan-Africanism. When the Sixth Pan-African Congress was convened in Dar es Salaam in 1974, the Guyanese historian Walter Rodney warned that a majority of congress attendants would be spokespersons of \"African and Caribbean states which in so many ways represent the negation of Pan-Africanism.\" Having been denied reentry into Jamaica in 1968 for his support of Black Power activism, Rodney was intimately familiar with the conservative bent of the new postcolonial states. By 1974, Abrahams's call for a Socialist United States of Africa had given away to the tepid Organization of African Unity (OAU), which supported liberation movements across the continent but remained committed to the political form of the nation-state. T he tensions inaugurated in the age of decolonization-between a black politics conscripted into a defense of the nation-state and one that aspired to succeed or transcend it-are with us today. Adi points to the OAU-sponsored First Pan-African Conference on Reparations for Slavery, Colonization and Neocolonization, which took place in 1993 in Abuja, Nigeria, as one of the starting points of a new Pan-African politics. The Abuja proclamation declared that \"the damage sustained by the African peoples is not a 'thing of the past' but is painfully manifest in the damaged lives of contemporary Africans from Harlem to Harare, in the damaged economies of the Black World from Guinea to Guyana, from Somalia to Suriname.\" Yet at the 2001 World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination and Xenophobia in Durban, South Africa, the geopolitical fractures of the black world frustrated a collective call for reparations. While Nigeria's then-President Olusegun Obasanjo told the conference that an apology from the European states that had imposed slavery and colonialism would suffice, Nigerian activists and civil society organizations joined the Caribbean states in demanding a more expansive program of repair. Despite the differences that have undermined Pan-Africanism throughout its existence, Adi is right to reject accounts that reduce its staying power to \"a matter of hazy vague emotions-a vision or a dream.\" The promise of Pan-Africanism was always much more than that. Like most political ideals, it helped galvanize generations into taking action. But as much as Pan-Africanism was an organized movement, it was also a sensibility, a culture, and a lived experience-guises in which it continues to shape contemporary life. Whereas black skin had been an epithet-famously captured by Frantz Fanon in the moment when a white French child pointed at him and said, \"Look, a Negro!\"-Pan-Africanism made it into a resource for imagining a radically egalitarian future. Out of forced exile and dispersal, it built a Black World, and from the depths of slavery, it limned the outlines of a fuller freedom in its songs of redemption. Editor's note: The photo caption has been updated to correct which congress is featured in the image. It was not the first, but the fifth.\n\nReflecting on the proceedings, Abrahams identified this call with a new \"militant phase\" of the struggle against colonialism. \"Forward to the Socialist United States of Africa! Long live Pan-Africanism!\" he exhorted after the congress's closing. To Du Bois's 1900 declaration that \"the problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line,\" Abrahams and his generation answered with a vision of an independent and united Africa that could finally secure racial equality across the globe. However, Abrahams's story also mirrored the swift disillusion that followed with the emergence of neocolonialism and the fractures within the Pan-Africanist movement. In his prescient 1956 novel A Wreath for Udomo , he depicted the unraveling of Pan-Africanism just as it was becoming a wide-ranging movement. The book's main character, Michael Udomo, is a composite figure (based on Nkrumah and Padmore) who moves from organizing for African independence in London to becoming the prime minister of a fictional \"Panafrica.\" Narrated in two parts, \"The Dream\" and \"The Reality,\" the novel tracks the exhilarating promise of national liberation, the hopes of a militant generation of Pan-Africanists, and the tragic choice that follows as Udomo weighs the costs of betraying the cause by accepting aid from a white settler nation or risking the ire of powerful states by supporting a fellow revolutionary. His dilemmas culminate in his destruction at the hands of his domestic opposition. Books in Review Pan-Africanism: A History By Hakim Adi Buy this book In the years to come, numerous anticolonial activists-from Nkrumah in Ghana to Ahmed Ben Bella in Algeria and Patrice Lumumba in Congo-would meet a similar fate, witnessing their hopes for independence dashed in the face of domestic dissension, Cold War interventions, and persistent economic dependence. In an age of decolonization, the Pan-Africanist wager was premised on the view that nationalism and internationalism must go hand in hand, that national independence could be secured only within regional and international institutions. As a result, the early postcolonial constitutions of Ghana, Guinea, and Mali, for instance, included clauses that authorized the delegation of sovereignty to a Union of African States when such an entity came into being. Yet over the three decades that followed World War II, internationalism and nationalism gradually came apart. While the sovereign state proved to be a limited vehicle for realizing independence and equality, its rights of nonintervention and territorial integrity emerged as powerful tools, especially against domestic critics and subnational challenges to state authority. In this context, committed Pan-Africanists and internationalists soon became wedded to the sovereign nation-state and its capacity to discipline newly independent and fragile societies.

A chance meeting in 1955 with Norman Manley, who was then leading Jamaica's anticolonial struggle, prompted Abrahams to move to the island, where he participated in its transition to independence and later supported the social transformation inaugurated by Norman Manley's son Michael Manley, the democratic socialist prime minister who swept into office in 1972. Abrahams worked as the chairman of Radio Jamaica and hoped that the Caribbean might realize the democratic, egalitarian, and internationalist vision of society that he had long fought for. From his home in the mountains of Jamaica, Abrahams set his sights across the Atlantic, critically assessing the failures of the postcolonial African states and especially the rise of authoritarian regimes. But as he declared near the end of his long life, \"Jamaica is Africa to me.\" The story of Pan-Africanism as a cresting wave of 20th century aspirations for African freedom and unity that crashed on the limits of postcolonial statehood is compelling because it attends to the defeats and disappointments that followed decolonization. Yet it is only one story of Pan-Africanism, and it renders invisible and illegible those projects of African unity that circumvented the aspiration to statehood and persisted in alternative institutional and ideological trajectories. Throughout his life, Abrahams used his novels to restage and recast Pan-Africanism's promise of black freedom. In his last novel, The View From Coyaba , published in 1985, he offered a transnational and transhistorical story that begins in Jamaica before the abolition of slavery there and follows the life of Jacob Brown, a Maroon descendant who studies with Du Bois in the United States before traveling to Africa as a missionary. Forced to flee Uganda, Brown returns to the hills of Jamaica, where his ancestors once took flight from slavery. Rather than see his return as marking a full circle, Brown awaits another opportunity to fly back to Africa. Driven by a similar impulse toward historical recovery, Hakim Adi's recent book Pan-Africanism: A History situates the tragedies of mid-20th-century Pan-Africanism in a longer and more capacious history. Pan-Africanism, he shows, began in the 18th century with the struggle against slavery and has persisted well into the 21st century with, among other movements, contemporary reparations activism. Rather than a crashing wave, Adi argues, Pan-Africanism \"might be more usefully viewed as one river with many streams and currents.\" It flowed and ebbed and then flowed (and ebbed) again, helping to shape much of the 20th century in the process and continuing to leave a deep imprint on the 21st. Few scholars are better positioned than Adi to chart Pan-Africanism's history: Over the course of two decades, he has chronicled it and the modern black experience more broadly as the writer or editor of 11 books, not to mention many journal articles and chapters written for other books. In Pan-Africanism , he brings to bear his encyclopedic knowledge of black freedom movements in Africa, the Americas, and Europe. A di opens his book with the history of the transatlantic slave trade and the black struggles for emancipation that arose from it. The forced migration of 12 million people across the Atlantic as chattel, he argues, created the conditions in which \"Africa\" became a transnational marker-an idea as much as a place. In this context, Olaudah Equiano, born in what is now the Igbo region of Nigeria in 1745 and enslaved at a young age, styled himself the \"African\" in his 1789 Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano . With fellow freedman Ottobah Cugoano he organized the Sons of Africa, a group that agitated for the end of the slave trade. From the communities of escaped slaves that dotted the Americas and the early repatriation movements to the emergence of a \"black empire\" in the Haitian Revolution, the image of Pan-Africa began to take shape. But as Adi shows, if Pan-Africa was born out of the experience of diasporic bondage, it was not a unidirectional transmission from the enslaved and the colonized in the Americas to Africa. The transatlantic idea of Africa also took inspiration from the connections formed between these communities and the Africans still on the continent. For instance, the vision of \"African regeneration\" articulated by Edward Blyden, the Caribbean author of 1857's A Vindication of the Negro Race, who eventually settled in Liberia, inspired a whole cohort of West African intellectuals-J.E. Casely Hayford, John Mensah Sarbah, and Mojola Agbebi among them-who demanded reforms to the British Empire on the basis of West African solidarity. Reversing this trajectory of influence, the writings of James Africanus Horton, a Sierra Leonean doctor who supported and extended Blyden's vision, proved an important source for the Jamaican Marcus Garvey, whose group the Universal Negro Improvement Association would become the largest black mass movement in the world. At its height in the 1920s, UNIA had almost 1,000 chapters and divisions in Africa, the Caribbean, South and Central America, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Garvey's Black Star Line, a shipping company that sought to cultivate commercial links among black people, was likely modeled on the efforts of Chief Alfred Sam, a trader from the Gold Coast (now Ghana) who registered a company in New York to develop trade routes and encourage black emigration to Africa.

Seyla Benhabib Ta-Nehisi Coates's Narratives of Freedom Elias Rodriques Jill Lepore's Liberal Gospel Daniel Immerwahr Throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries, black people moved around the world in search of work and greater freedom, and through this they generated solidarities out of the collective experience of racialized slavery and colonialism, turning forced displacement and exile into political possibility. Meetings like the 1900 Pan-African Conference and its successors might suggest that these forms of mobility were limited to a small male elite. But as Adi highlights, the official spaces of Pan-Africanism relied on women's labor, even if women were marginalized. The 1900 conference, best remembered for Du Bois's evocative formulation of the global color line, was in fact co-organized by Alice Victoria Kinloch of South Africa, who emerged as a critic of black oppression in her homeland before moving to Britain in 1896.

A chance meeting in 1955 with Norman Manley, who was then leading Jamaica's anticolonial struggle, prompted Abrahams to move to the island, where he participated in its transition to independence and later supported the social transformation inaugurated by Norman Manley's son Michael Manley, the democratic socialist prime minister who swept into office in 1972. Abrahams worked as the chairman of Radio Jamaica and hoped that the Caribbean might realize the democratic, egalitarian, and internationalist vision of society that he had long fought for. From his home in the mountains of Jamaica, Abrahams set his sights across the Atlantic, critically assessing the failures of the postcolonial African states and especially the rise of authoritarian regimes. But as he declared near the end of his long life, \"Jamaica is Africa to me.\" The story of Pan-Africanism as a cresting wave of 20th century aspirations for African freedom and unity that crashed on the limits of postcolonial statehood is compelling because it attends to the defeats and disappointments that followed decolonization. Yet it is only one story of Pan-Africanism, and it renders invisible and illegible those projects of African unity that circumvented the aspiration to statehood and persisted in alternative institutional and ideological trajectories. Throughout his life, Abrahams used his novels to restage and recast Pan-Africanism's promise of black freedom. In his last novel, The View From Coyaba , published in 1985, he offered a transnational and transhistorical story that begins in Jamaica before the abolition of slavery there and follows the life of Jacob Brown, a Maroon descendant who studies with Du Bois in the United States before traveling to Africa as a missionary. Forced to flee Uganda, Brown returns to the hills of Jamaica, where his ancestors once took flight from slavery. Rather than see his return as marking a full circle, Brown awaits another opportunity to fly back to Africa. Driven by a similar impulse toward historical recovery, Hakim Adi's recent book Pan-Africanism: A History situates the tragedies of mid-20th-century Pan-Africanism in a longer and more capacious history. Pan-Africanism, he shows, began in the 18th century with the struggle against slavery and has persisted well into the 21st century with, among other movements, contemporary reparations activism. Rather than a crashing wave, Adi argues, Pan-Africanism \"might be more usefully viewed as one river with many streams and currents.\" It flowed and ebbed and then flowed (and ebbed) again, helping to shape much of the 20th century in the process and continuing to leave a deep imprint on the 21st. Few scholars are better positioned than Adi to chart Pan-Africanism's history: Over the course of two decades, he has chronicled it and the modern black experience more broadly as the writer or editor of 11 books, not to mention many journal articles and chapters written for other books. In Pan-Africanism , he brings to bear his encyclopedic knowledge of black freedom movements in Africa, the Americas, and Europe. A di opens his book with the history of the transatlantic slave trade and the black struggles for emancipation that arose from it. The forced migration of 12 million people across the Atlantic as chattel, he argues, created the conditions in which \"Africa\" became a transnational marker-an idea as much as a place. In this context, Olaudah Equiano, born in what is now the Igbo region of Nigeria in 1745 and enslaved at a young age, styled himself the \"African\" in his 1789 Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano . With fellow freedman Ottobah Cugoano he organized the Sons of Africa, a group that agitated for the end of the slave trade. From the communities of escaped slaves that dotted the Americas and the early repatriation movements to the emergence of a \"black empire\" in the Haitian Revolution, the image of Pan-Africa began to take shape. But as Adi shows, if Pan-Africa was born out of the experience of diasporic bondage, it was not a unidirectional transmission from the enslaved and the colonized in the Americas to Africa. The transatlantic idea of Africa also took inspiration from the connections formed between these communities and the Africans still on the continent. For instance, the vision of \"African regeneration\" articulated by Edward Blyden, the Caribbean author of 1857's A Vindication of the Negro Race, who eventually settled in Liberia, inspired a whole cohort of West African intellectuals-J.E. Casely Hayford, John Mensah Sarbah, and Mojola Agbebi among them-who demanded reforms to the British Empire on the basis of West African solidarity. Reversing this trajectory of influence, the writings of James Africanus Horton, a Sierra Leonean doctor who supported and extended Blyden's vision, proved an important source for the Jamaican Marcus Garvey, whose group the Universal Negro Improvement Association would become the largest black mass movement in the world. At its height in the 1920s, UNIA had almost 1,000 chapters and divisions in Africa, the Caribbean, South and Central America, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Garvey's Black Star Line, a shipping company that sought to cultivate commercial links among black people, was likely modeled on the efforts of Chief Alfred Sam, a trader from the Gold Coast (now Ghana) who registered a company in New York to develop trade routes and encourage black emigration to Africa.

Seyla Benhabib Ta-Nehisi Coates's Narratives of Freedom Elias Rodriques Jill Lepore's Liberal Gospel Daniel Immerwahr Throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries, black people moved around the world in search of work and greater freedom, and through this they generated solidarities out of the collective experience of racialized slavery and colonialism, turning forced displacement and exile into political possibility. Meetings like the 1900 Pan-African Conference and its successors might suggest that these forms of mobility were limited to a small male elite. But as Adi highlights, the official spaces of Pan-Africanism relied on women's labor, even if women were marginalized. The 1900 conference, best remembered for Du Bois's evocative formulation of the global color line, was in fact co-organized by Alice Victoria Kinloch of South Africa, who emerged as a critic of black oppression in her homeland before moving to Britain in 1896. Garvey's wives Amy Ashwood and Amy Jacques, as well as Garveyite women like Mamie De Mena and Henrietta Vinton Davis, also contributed to the successful expansion of UNIA as they advanced women's causes within the organization. The Martinican sisters Paulette and Jane Nardal, as students in Paris during the 1920s, convened gatherings of black students and exiles and helped black print culture to proliferate. In an article for the inaugural issue of La Dépêche Africaine ( The African Dispatch ), Jane Nardal articulated the emergence of a new \" Internationalisme Noir \" (Black Internationalism). \"Blacks of all origins and nationalities, with different customs and religions,\" she argued, \"vaguely sense that they belong in spite of everything to a single and same race.... From now on there will be a certain interest, a certain originality, a certain pride in being black, in turning back towards Africa, cradle of the blacks, in recalling a common origin.\" Outside the rarefied conferences and chance meetings in imperial metropoles like London and Paris, the vision of a global Africa was lived and enacted in everyday life and culture by millions who remain anonymous to history. The idea of African freedom and unity traveled with the Caribbean workers who dug the Panama Canal. It was carried with the African Americans who escaped north in the Great Migration, and it traversed the African continent with figures like Abrahams's father, who traveled from his native Ethiopia to South Africa in order to find work in the mines and plantations of a voracious new imperialism. Black sailors and migrant workers in the circum-Caribbean and in southern Africa clandestinely distributed UNIA's newspaper, Negro World . The Comintern-funded Negro Worker , the Paris-based Le Cri des Nègres , and countless other black newspapers and magazines carried news of a global Africa along similar networks. After formal decolonization was achieved, the message of Pan-Africanism lived on in the vernaculars of Rastafarianism and reggae music, the aesthetics of the Afro, and the global reverberations of \"Black is beautiful.\" W eaving together the institutional high politics of Pan-Africanism with its popular and cultural iterations, Adi presents his readers with a wide tapestry of black freedom dreams that challenges many of the neat divisions imposed on black intellectual and political life by historians and scholars. For instance, much has been written about the differences between Du Bois's moderate calls for imperial reform at the early Pan-African congresses and Garvey's radical demand of \"Africa for the Africans.\" But as Adi shows, the two were united in their shared aspirations for black representation within the League of Nations, and figures like Kojo Tovalou Houénou of Dahomey (now Benin), who founded the Ligue Universelle Pour la Défense de la Race Noire (Universal League for the Defense of the Black Race), deftly navigated these two visions of Pan-Africanism. He attended UNIA meetings in New York and corresponded with Du Bois in the hope of positioning his own league as an umbrella Pan-African organization. For Houénou, Africa-not a particular territory or region-was his country, and the league sought to \"develop the bonds of solidarity and of universal brotherhood between all members of the black race; to bring them together for the restoration of their country of origin-Africa.\" Houénou's project, Adi tells us, was \"an aspiration that remained unrealized.\" Not only the efforts of imperial states to quash resistance and censor black publications but also internal differences of language, ideology, and orientation worked to fragment this and other efforts to consolidate and centralize Pan-Africanism. It is here that we begin to see the difficulties of viewing Pan-Africanism as one unvaried whole. Although Adi acknowledges different currents and streams, his river metaphor is too naturalistic to capture the disjuncture and disruption, the reformulation and rearticulation that characterized projects of African unity. Especially when he surveys the 1920s and '30s-arguably the high point of Pan-African cultural and political organizing-one finds the historical record replete with ephemeral organizations and publications and fleeting collaborations. Even following a single historical figure moves you through a half-dozen iterations of Pan-African politics. Take George Padmore. Born Malcolm Nurse in Arouca, Trinidad, in 1903, he began his political career by joining the Communist Party of the United States, where he lived as a student, and quickly emerged as a leading figure of the International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers and the editor of The Negro Worker from his base in Hamburg, Germany. Deported in 1933 by the Nazi police, then ousted from the party the following year for his criticism of Soviet alliances with colonial powers, Padmore briefly joined his fellow black communist Tiémoko Garan Kouyaté in Paris, where they planned a Negro World Unity congress. When growing repression and a lack of funding thwarted the group's founding, Padmore moved to London and, with fellow Trinidadian C.L.R. James, organized the International African Friends of Abyssinia (IAFA) in 1935 \"to assist by all means in their power in the maintenance of the territorial integrity and political independence of Abyssinia\" (now Ethiopia) as Italy threatened it with invasion. IAFA soon folded, however, and James and Padmore turned their efforts to a new organization, the International African Service Bureau, which would then serve as the basis for the Pan-African Federation, which organized the Fifth Pan-African Congress in 1945. Related Article When the Black Panthers Came to Algeria Elias Rodriques Writing of this interwar period, Brent Hayes Edwards has argued that the \"unforeseen alliances\" that diasporic blacks fostered \"also are characterized by unavoidable misapprehensions and misreadings, persistent blindnesses and solipsisms, self-defeating and abortive collaborations, a failure to translate even a basic grammar of blackness.\" This is not to say that visions of Pan-Africanism were futile from the outset but instead only to note the experimental and improvisational character of the projects taken up in its name and to acknowledge the linguistic, geographic, and ideological tensions against which Pan-Africanists labored. A ttending to the fragmentary quality of Pan-Africanism helps us make better sense of the discontinuities and reversals so presciently outlined in A Wreath for Udomo . The postwar phase of Pan-Africanism was unassimilable into a single movement or project, in part because the very premise of decolonization appeared to confine anticolonial activists to the territorially bound nation-state, undermining the transnational and nonterritorial scope of Pan-Africa. Following earlier histories of Pan-Africanism, Adi describes the shift of Pan-African activity from imperial metropoles to postcolonial Ghana and other newly independent states as the Pan-Africanists' \"return home.\" Yet such a reading narrows the scope of Pan-Africanism's internationalist ambitions; it becomes a black Zionism in search of a national homeland. To be sure, repatriation has always featured prominently in the African diasporic imagination, and so has the thirst for national independence. Reflecting in 1971 on The Black Jacobins , his classic 1938 history of the Haitian Revolution, James noted, \"It was written about Africa. It wasn't written about the Caribbean.\" Yet what mattered for him was not that Pan-Africanism might return home but that the Caribbean was the terrain on which African independence could be worked out. But even the achievement of African independence was not the end point, in his view. It was just the beginning of a global political and economic transformation-a world revolution that would simultaneously defeat white supremacy and capitalism. Nurturing a commitment to a Pan-Africa that exceeded a continental cartography, James was ambivalent about a politics that directed its energy primarily toward nation-state building and worried that despite the best intentions of the new generation of postcolonial statesmen, the trappings of state sovereignty would soon thwart their larger ambitions of securing African unity and building a racially egalitarian international order. The shift of Pan-African activity from imperial metropoles to the African continent and from international networks to postcolonial nation-states is perhaps Pan-Africanism's most contentious and uncertain moment-one that exposed the fragile suturing of difference and unity. The emergence of independent states like Ghana and Tanzania-led by two advocates of African socialism, Nkrumah and Julius Nyerere-created institutional and ideological openings to realize African unity. Yet the achievement of state sovereignty also worked to stymie more radical visions of Pan-Africanism. When the Sixth Pan-African Congress was convened in Dar es Salaam in 1974, the Guyanese historian Walter Rodney warned that a majority of congress attendants would be spokespersons of \"African and Caribbean states which in so many ways represent the negation of Pan-Africanism.\" Having been denied reentry into Jamaica in 1968 for his support of Black Power activism, Rodney was intimately familiar with the conservative bent of the new postcolonial states. By 1974, Abrahams's call for a Socialist United States of Africa had given away to the tepid Organization of African Unity (OAU), which supported liberation movements across the continent but remained committed to the political form of the nation-state. T he tensions inaugurated in the age of decolonization-between a black politics conscripted into a defense of the nation-state and one that aspired to succeed or transcend it-are with us today. Adi points to the OAU-sponsored First Pan-African Conference on Reparations for Slavery, Colonization and Neocolonization, which took place in 1993 in Abuja, Nigeria, as one of the starting points of a new Pan-African politics. The Abuja proclamation declared that \"the damage sustained by the African peoples is not a 'thing of the past' but is painfully manifest in the damaged lives of contemporary Africans from Harlem to Harare, in the damaged economies of the Black World from Guinea to Guyana, from Somalia to Suriname.\" Yet at the 2001 World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination and Xenophobia in Durban, South Africa, the geopolitical fractures of the black world frustrated a collective call for reparations. While Nigeria's then-President Olusegun Obasanjo told the conference that an apology from the European states that had imposed slavery and colonialism would suffice, Nigerian activists and civil society organizations joined the Caribbean states in demanding a more expansive program of repair. Despite the differences that have undermined Pan-Africanism throughout its existence, Adi is right to reject accounts that reduce its staying power to \"a matter of hazy vague emotions-a vision or a dream.\" The promise of Pan-Africanism was always much more than that. Like most political ideals, it helped galvanize generations into taking action. But as much as Pan-Africanism was an organized movement, it was also a sensibility, a culture, and a lived experience-guises in which it continues to shape contemporary life. Whereas black skin had been an epithet-famously captured by Frantz Fanon in the moment when a white French child pointed at him and said, \"Look, a Negro!\"-Pan-Africanism made it into a resource for imagining a radically egalitarian future. Out of forced exile and dispersal, it built a Black World, and from the depths of slavery, it limned the outlines of a fuller freedom in its songs of redemption.

In an age of decolonization, the Pan-Africanist wager was premised on the view that nationalism and internationalism must go hand in hand, that national independence could be secured only within regional and international institutions. As a result, the early postcolonial constitutions of Ghana, Guinea, and Mali, for instance, included clauses that authorized the delegation of sovereignty to a Union of African States when such an entity came into being. Yet over the three decades that followed World War II, internationalism and nationalism gradually came apart. While the sovereign state proved to be a limited vehicle for realizing independence and equality, its rights of nonintervention and territorial integrity emerged as powerful tools, especially against domestic critics and subnational challenges to state authority. In this context, committed Pan-Africanists and internationalists soon became wedded to the sovereign nation-state and its capacity to discipline newly independent and fragile societies.

When the Sixth Pan-African Congress was convened in Dar es Salaam in 1974, the Guyanese historian Walter Rodney warned that a majority of congress attendants would be spokespersons of \"African and Caribbean states which in so many ways represent the negation of Pan-Africanism.\" Having been denied reentry into Jamaica in 1968 for his support of Black Power activism, Rodney was intimately familiar with the conservative bent of the new postcolonial states. By 1974, Abrahams's call for a Socialist United States of Africa had given away to the tepid Organization of African Unity (OAU), which supported liberation movements across the continent but remained committed to the political form of the nation-state. T he tensions inaugurated in the age of decolonization-between a black politics conscripted into a defense of the nation-state and one that aspired to succeed or transcend it-are with us today. Adi points to the OAU-sponsored First Pan-African Conference on Reparations for Slavery, Colonization and Neocolonization, which took place in 1993 in Abuja, Nigeria, as one of the starting points of a new Pan-African politics. The Abuja proclamation declared that \"the damage sustained by the African peoples is not a 'thing of the past' but is painfully manifest in the damaged lives of contemporary Africans from Harlem to Harare, in the damaged economies of the Black World from Guinea to Guyana, from Somalia to Suriname.\" Yet at the 2001 World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination and Xenophobia in Durban, South Africa, the geopolitical fractures of the black world frustrated a collective call for reparations. While Nigeria's then-President Olusegun Obasanjo told the conference that an apology from the European states that had imposed slavery and colonialism would suffice, Nigerian activists and civil society organizations joined the Caribbean states in demanding a more expansive program of repair. Despite the differences that have undermined Pan-Africanism throughout its existence, Adi is right to reject accounts that reduce its staying power to \"a matter of hazy vague emotions-a vision or a dream.\" The promise of Pan-Africanism was always much more than that. Like most political ideals, it helped galvanize generations into taking action. But as much as Pan-Africanism was an organized movement, it was also a sensibility, a culture, and a lived experience-guises in which it continues to shape contemporary life. Whereas black skin had been an epithet-famously captured by Frantz Fanon in the moment when a white French child pointed at him and said, \"Look, a Negro!\"-Pan-Africanism made it into a resource for imagining a radically egalitarian future. Out of forced exile and dispersal, it built a Black World, and from the depths of slavery, it limned the outlines of a fuller freedom in its songs of redemption.

A chance meeting in 1955 with Norman Manley, who was then leading Jamaica's anticolonial struggle, prompted Abrahams to move to the island, where he participated in its transition to independence and later supported the social transformation inaugurated by Norman Manley's son Michael Manley, the democratic socialist prime minister who swept into office in 1972. Abrahams worked as the chairman of Radio Jamaica and hoped that the Caribbean might realize the democratic, egalitarian, and internationalist vision of society that he had long fought for. From his home in the mountains of Jamaica, Abrahams set his sights across the Atlantic, critically assessing the failures of the postcolonial African states and especially the rise of authoritarian regimes. But as he declared near the end of his long life, \"Jamaica is Africa to me.\" The story of Pan-Africanism as a cresting wave of 20th century aspirations for African freedom and unity that crashed on the limits of postcolonial statehood is compelling because it attends to the defeats and disappointments that followed decolonization. Yet it is only one story of Pan-Africanism, and it renders invisible and illegible those projects of African unity that circumvented the aspiration to statehood and persisted in alternative institutional and ideological trajectories. Throughout his life, Abrahams used his novels to restage and recast Pan-Africanism's promise of black freedom. In his last novel, The View From Coyaba , published in 1985, he offered a transnational and transhistorical story that begins in Jamaica before the abolition of slavery there and follows the life of Jacob Brown, a Maroon descendant who studies with Du Bois in the United States before traveling to Africa as a missionary. Forced to flee Uganda, Brown returns to the hills of Jamaica, where his ancestors once took flight from slavery. Rather than see his return as marking a full circle, Brown awaits another opportunity to fly back to Africa. Driven by a similar impulse toward historical recovery, Hakim Adi's recent book Pan-Africanism: A History situates the tragedies of mid-20th-century Pan-Africanism in a longer and more capacious history. Pan-Africanism, he shows, began in the 18th century with the struggle against slavery and has persisted well into the 21st century with, among other movements, contemporary reparations activism. Rather than a crashing wave, Adi argues, Pan-Africanism \"might be more usefully viewed as one river with many streams and currents.\" It flowed and ebbed and then flowed (and ebbed) again, helping to shape much of the 20th century in the process and continuing to leave a deep imprint on the 21st. Few scholars are better positioned than Adi to chart Pan-Africanism's history: Over the course of two decades, he has chronicled it and the modern black experience more broadly as the writer or editor of 11 books, not to mention many journal articles and chapters written for other books. In Pan-Africanism , he brings to bear his encyclopedic knowledge of black freedom movements in Africa, the Americas, and Europe. A di opens his book with the history of the transatlantic slave trade and the black struggles for emancipation that arose from it. The forced migration of 12 million people across the Atlantic as chattel, he argues, created the conditions in which \"Africa\" became a transnational marker-an idea as much as a place. In this context, Olaudah Equiano, born in what is now the Igbo region of Nigeria in 1745 and enslaved at a young age, styled himself the \"African\" in his 1789 Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano . With fellow freedman Ottobah Cugoano he organized the Sons of Africa, a group that agitated for the end of the slave trade. From the communities of escaped slaves that dotted the Americas and the early repatriation movements to the emergence of a \"black empire\" in the Haitian Revolution, the image of Pan-Africa began to take shape. But as Adi shows, if Pan-Africa was born out of the experience of diasporic bondage, it was not a unidirectional transmission from the enslaved and the colonized in the Americas to Africa. The transatlantic idea of Africa also took inspiration from the connections formed between these communities and the Africans still on the continent. For instance, the vision of \"African regeneration\" articulated by Edward Blyden, the Caribbean author of 1857's A Vindication of the Negro Race, who eventually settled in Liberia, inspired a whole cohort of West African intellectuals-J.E. Casely Hayford, John Mensah Sarbah, and Mojola Agbebi among them-who demanded reforms to the British Empire on the basis of West African solidarity. Reversing this trajectory of influence, the writings of James Africanus Horton, a Sierra Leonean doctor who supported and extended Blyden's vision, proved an important source for the Jamaican Marcus Garvey, whose group the Universal Negro Improvement Association would become the largest black mass movement in the world. At its height in the 1920s, UNIA had almost 1,000 chapters and divisions in Africa, the Caribbean, South and Central America, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Garvey's Black Star Line, a shipping company that sought to cultivate commercial links among black people, was likely modeled on the efforts of Chief Alfred Sam, a trader from the Gold Coast (now Ghana) who registered a company in New York to develop trade routes and encourage black emigration to Africa.

Seyla Benhabib Ta-Nehisi Coates's Narratives of Freedom Elias Rodriques Jill Lepore's Liberal Gospel Daniel Immerwahr Throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries, black people moved around the world in search of work and greater freedom, and through this they generated solidarities out of the collective experience of racialized slavery and colonialism, turning forced displacement and exile into political possibility. Meetings like the 1900 Pan-African Conference and its successors might suggest that these forms of mobility were limited to a small male elite. But as Adi highlights, the official spaces of Pan-Africanism relied on women's labor, even if women were marginalized. The 1900 conference, best remembered for Du Bois's evocative formulation of the global color line, was in fact co-organized by Alice Victoria Kinloch of South Africa, who emerged as a critic of black oppression in her homeland before moving to Britain in 1896. Garvey's wives Amy Ashwood and Amy Jacques, as well as Garveyite women like Mamie De Mena and Henrietta Vinton Davis, also contributed to the successful expansion of UNIA as they advanced women's causes within the organization. The Martinican sisters Paulette and Jane Nardal, as students in Paris during the 1920s, convened gatherings of black students and exiles and helped black print culture to proliferate. In an article for the inaugural issue of La Dépêche Africaine ( The African Dispatch ), Jane Nardal articulated the emergence of a new \" Internationalisme Noir \" (Black Internationalism). \"Blacks of all origins and nationalities, with different customs and religions,\" she argued, \"vaguely sense that they belong in spite of everything to a single and same race.... From now on there will be a certain interest, a certain originality, a certain pride in being black, in turning back towards Africa, cradle of the blacks, in recalling a common origin.\" Outside the rarefied conferences and chance meetings in imperial metropoles like London and Paris, the vision of a global Africa was lived and enacted in everyday life and culture by millions who remain anonymous to history. The idea of African freedom and unity traveled with the Caribbean workers who dug the Panama Canal. It was carried with the African Americans who escaped north in the Great Migration, and it traversed the African continent with figures like Abrahams's father, who traveled from his native Ethiopia to South Africa in order to find work in the mines and plantations of a voracious new imperialism. Black sailors and migrant workers in the circum-Caribbean and in southern Africa clandestinely distributed UNIA's newspaper, Negro World . The Comintern-funded Negro Worker , the Paris-based Le Cri des Nègres , and countless other black newspapers and magazines carried news of a global Africa along similar networks. After formal decolonization was achieved, the message of Pan-Africanism lived on in the vernaculars of Rastafarianism and reggae music, the aesthetics of the Afro, and the global reverberations of \"Black is beautiful.\" W eaving together the institutional high politics of Pan-Africanism with its popular and cultural iterations, Adi presents his readers with a wide tapestry of black freedom dreams that challenges many of the neat divisions imposed on black intellectual and political life by historians and scholars. For instance, much has been written about the differences between Du Bois's moderate calls for imperial reform at the early Pan-African congresses and Garvey's radical demand of \"Africa for the Africans.\" But as Adi shows, the two were united in their shared aspirations for black representation within the League of Nations, and figures like Kojo Tovalou Houénou of Dahomey (now Benin), who founded the Ligue Universelle Pour la Défense de la Race Noire (Universal League for the Defense of the Black Race), deftly navigated these two visions of Pan-Africanism. He attended UNIA meetings in New York and corresponded with Du Bois in the hope of positioning his own league as an umbrella Pan-African organization. For Houénou, Africa-not a particular territory or region-was his country, and the league sought to \"develop the bonds of solidarity and of universal brotherhood between all members of the black race; to bring them together for the restoration of their country of origin-Africa.\" Houénou's project, Adi tells us, was \"an aspiration that remained unrealized.\" Not only the efforts of imperial states to quash resistance and censor black publications but also internal differences of language, ideology, and orientation worked to fragment this and other efforts to consolidate and centralize Pan-Africanism. It is here that we begin to see the difficulties of viewing Pan-Africanism as one unvaried whole. Although Adi acknowledges different currents and streams, his river metaphor is too naturalistic to capture the disjuncture and disruption, the reformulation and rearticulation that characterized projects of African unity. Especially when he surveys the 1920s and '30s-arguably the high point of Pan-African cultural and political organizing-one finds the historical record replete with ephemeral organizations and publications and fleeting collaborations. Even following a single historical figure moves you through a half-dozen iterations of Pan-African politics. Take George Padmore. Born Malcolm Nurse in Arouca, Trinidad, in 1903, he began his political career by joining the Communist Party of the United States, where he lived as a student, and quickly emerged as a leading figure of the International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers and the editor of The Negro Worker from his base in Hamburg, Germany. Deported in 1933 by the Nazi police, then ousted from the party the following year for his criticism of Soviet alliances with colonial powers, Padmore briefly joined his fellow black communist Tiémoko Garan Kouyaté in Paris, where they planned a Negro World Unity congress. When growing repression and a lack of funding thwarted the group's founding, Padmore moved to London and, with fellow Trinidadian C.L.R. James, organized the International African Friends of Abyssinia (IAFA) in 1935 \"to assist by all means in their power in the maintenance of the territorial integrity and political independence of Abyssinia\" (now Ethiopia) as Italy threatened it with invasion. IAFA soon folded, however, and James and Padmore turned their efforts to a new organization, the International African Service Bureau, which would then serve as the basis for the Pan-African Federation, which organized the Fifth Pan-African Congress in 1945. Related Article When the Black Panthers Came to Algeria Elias Rodriques Writing of this interwar period, Brent Hayes Edwards has argued that the \"unforeseen alliances\" that diasporic blacks fostered \"also are characterized by unavoidable misapprehensions and misreadings, persistent blindnesses and solipsisms, self-defeating and abortive collaborations, a failure to translate even a basic grammar of blackness.\" This is not to say that visions of Pan-Africanism were futile from the outset but instead only to note the experimental and improvisational character of the projects taken up in its name and to acknowledge the linguistic, geographic, and ideological tensions against which Pan-Africanists labored. A ttending to the fragmentary quality of Pan-Africanism helps us make better sense of the discontinuities and reversals so presciently outlined in A Wreath for Udomo . The postwar phase of Pan-Africanism was unassimilable into a single movement or project, in part because the very premise of decolonization appeared to confine anticolonial activists to the territorially bound nation-state, undermining the transnational and nonterritorial scope of Pan-Africa. Following earlier histories of Pan-Africanism, Adi describes the shift of Pan-African activity from imperial metropoles to postcolonial Ghana and other newly independent states as the Pan-Africanists' \"return home.\" Yet such a reading narrows the scope of Pan-Africanism's internationalist ambitions; it becomes a black Zionism in search of a national homeland. To be sure, repatriation has always featured prominently in the African diasporic imagination, and so has the thirst for national independence. Reflecting in 1971 on The Black Jacobins , his classic 1938 history of the Haitian Revolution, James noted, \"It was written about Africa. It wasn't written about the Caribbean.\" Yet what mattered for him was not that Pan-Africanism might return home but that the Caribbean was the terrain on which African independence could be worked out. But even the achievement of African independence was not the end point, in his view. It was just the beginning of a global political and economic transformation-a world revolution that would simultaneously defeat white supremacy and capitalism. Nurturing a commitment to a Pan-Africa that exceeded a continental cartography, James was ambivalent about a politics that directed its energy primarily toward nation-state building and worried that despite the best intentions of the new generation of postcolonial statesmen, the trappings of state sovereignty would soon thwart their larger ambitions of securing African unity and building a racially egalitarian international order. The shift of Pan-African activity from imperial metropoles to the African continent and from international networks to postcolonial nation-states is perhaps Pan-Africanism's most contentious and uncertain moment-one that exposed the fragile suturing of difference and unity. The emergence of independent states like Ghana and Tanzania-led by two advocates of African socialism, Nkrumah and Julius Nyerere-created institutional and ideological openings to realize African unity.

The Abuja proclamation declared that \"the damage sustained by the African peoples is not a 'thing of the past' but is painfully manifest in the damaged lives of contemporary Africans from Harlem to Harare, in the damaged economies of the Black World from Guinea to Guyana, from Somalia to Suriname.\" Yet at the 2001 World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination and Xenophobia in Durban, South Africa, the geopolitical fractures of the black world frustrated a collective call for reparations. While Nigeria's then-President Olusegun Obasanjo told the conference that an apology from the European states that had imposed slavery and colonialism would suffice, Nigerian activists and civil society organizations joined the Caribbean states in demanding a more expansive program of repair. Despite the differences that have undermined Pan-Africanism throughout its existence, Adi is right to reject accounts that reduce its staying power to \"a matter of hazy vague emotions-a vision or a dream.\" The promise of Pan-Africanism was always much more than that. Like most political ideals, it helped galvanize generations into taking action. But as much as Pan-Africanism was an organized movement, it was also a sensibility, a culture, and a lived experience-guises in which it continues to shape contemporary life. Whereas black skin had been an epithet-famously captured by Frantz Fanon in the moment when a white French child pointed at him and said, \"Look, a Negro!\"-Pan-Africanism made it into a resource for imagining a radically egalitarian future. Out of forced exile and dispersal, it built a Black World, and from the depths of slavery, it limned the outlines of a fuller freedom in its songs of redemption. Editor's note: The photo caption has been updated to correct which congress is featured in the image. It was not the first, but the fifth.\n\nDriven by a similar impulse toward historical recovery, Hakim Adi's recent book Pan-Africanism: A History situates the tragedies of mid-20th-century Pan-Africanism in a longer and more capacious history. Pan-Africanism, he shows, began in the 18th century with the struggle against slavery and has persisted well into the 21st century with, among other movements, contemporary reparations activism. Rather than a crashing wave, Adi argues, Pan-Africanism \"might be more usefully viewed as one river with many streams and currents.\" It flowed and ebbed and then flowed (and ebbed) again, helping to shape much of the 20th century in the process and continuing to leave a deep imprint on the 21st. Few scholars are better positioned than Adi to chart Pan-Africanism's history: Over the course of two decades, he has chronicled it and the modern black experience more broadly as the writer or editor of 11 books, not to mention many journal articles and chapters written for other books. In Pan-Africanism , he brings to bear his encyclopedic knowledge of black freedom movements in Africa, the Americas, and Europe. A di opens his book with the history of the transatlantic slave trade and the black struggles for emancipation that arose from it. The forced migration of 12 million people across the Atlantic as chattel, he argues, created the conditions in which \"Africa\" became a transnational marker-an idea as much as a place. In this context, Olaudah Equiano, born in what is now the Igbo region of Nigeria in 1745 and enslaved at a young age, styled himself the \"African\" in his 1789 Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano . With fellow freedman Ottobah Cugoano he organized the Sons of Africa, a group that agitated for the end of the slave trade. From the communities of escaped slaves that dotted the Americas and the early repatriation movements to the emergence of a \"black empire\" in the Haitian Revolution, the image of Pan-Africa began to take shape. But as Adi shows, if Pan-Africa was born out of the experience of diasporic bondage, it was not a unidirectional transmission from the enslaved and the colonized in the Americas to Africa. The transatlantic idea of Africa also took inspiration from the connections formed between these communities and the Africans still on the continent. For instance, the vision of \"African regeneration\" articulated by Edward Blyden, the Caribbean author of 1857's A Vindication of the Negro Race, who eventually settled in Liberia, inspired a whole cohort of West African intellectuals-J.E. Casely Hayford, John Mensah Sarbah, and Mojola Agbebi among them-who demanded reforms to the British Empire on the basis of West African solidarity. Reversing this trajectory of influence, the writings of James Africanus Horton, a Sierra Leonean doctor who supported and extended Blyden's vision, proved an important source for the Jamaican Marcus Garvey, whose group the Universal Negro Improvement Association would become the largest black mass movement in the world. At its height in the 1920s, UNIA had almost 1,000 chapters and divisions in Africa, the Caribbean, South and Central America, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Garvey's Black Star Line, a shipping company that sought to cultivate commercial links among black people, was likely modeled on the efforts of Chief Alfred Sam, a trader from the Gold Coast (now Ghana) who registered a company in New York to develop trade routes and encourage black emigration to Africa.

Seyla Benhabib Ta-Nehisi Coates's Narratives of Freedom Elias Rodriques Jill Lepore's Liberal Gospel Daniel Immerwahr Throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries, black people moved around the world in search of work and greater freedom, and through this they generated solidarities out of the collective experience of racialized slavery and colonialism, turning forced displacement and exile into political possibility. Meetings like the 1900 Pan-African Conference and its successors might suggest that these forms of mobility were limited to a small male elite. But as Adi highlights, the official spaces of Pan-Africanism relied on women's labor, even if women were marginalized. The 1900 conference, best remembered for Du Bois's evocative formulation of the global color line, was in fact co-organized by Alice Victoria Kinloch of South Africa, who emerged as a critic of black oppression in her homeland before moving to Britain in 1896. Garvey's wives Amy Ashwood and Amy Jacques, as well as Garveyite women like Mamie De Mena and Henrietta Vinton Davis, also contributed to the successful expansion of UNIA as they advanced women's causes within the organization. The Martinican sisters Paulette and Jane Nardal, as students in Paris during the 1920s, convened gatherings of black students and exiles and helped black print culture to proliferate. In an article for the inaugural issue of La Dépêche Africaine ( The African Dispatch ), Jane Nardal articulated the emergence of a new \" Internationalisme Noir \" (Black Internationalism). \"Blacks of all origins and nationalities, with different customs and religions,\" she argued, \"vaguely sense that they belong in spite of everything to a single and same race.... From now on there will be a certain interest, a certain originality, a certain pride in being black, in turning back towards Africa, cradle of the blacks, in recalling a common origin.\" Outside the rarefied conferences and chance meetings in imperial metropoles like London and Paris, the vision of a global Africa was lived and enacted in everyday life and culture by millions who remain anonymous to history. The idea of African freedom and unity traveled with the Caribbean workers who dug the Panama Canal. It was carried with the African Americans who escaped north in the Great Migration, and it traversed the African continent with figures like Abrahams's father, who traveled from his native Ethiopia to South Africa in order to find work in the mines and plantations of a voracious new imperialism. Black sailors and migrant workers in the circum-Caribbean and in southern Africa clandestinely distributed UNIA's newspaper, Negro World . The Comintern-funded Negro Worker , the Paris-based Le Cri des Nègres , and countless other black newspapers and magazines carried news of a global Africa along similar networks. After formal decolonization was achieved, the message of Pan-Africanism lived on in the vernaculars of Rastafarianism and reggae music, the aesthetics of the Afro, and the global reverberations of \"Black is beautiful.\" W eaving together the institutional high politics of Pan-Africanism with its popular and cultural iterations, Adi presents his readers with a wide tapestry of black freedom dreams that challenges many of the neat divisions imposed on black intellectual and political life by historians and scholars. For instance, much has been written about the differences between Du Bois's moderate calls for imperial reform at the early Pan-African congresses and Garvey's radical demand of \"Africa for the Africans.\" But as Adi shows, the two were united in their shared aspirations for black representation within the League of Nations, and figures like Kojo Tovalou Houénou of Dahomey (now Benin), who founded the Ligue Universelle Pour la Défense de la Race Noire (Universal League for the Defense of the Black Race), deftly navigated these two visions of Pan-Africanism. He attended UNIA meetings in New York and corresponded with Du Bois in the hope of positioning his own league as an umbrella Pan-African organization. For Houénou, Africa-not a particular territory or region-was his country, and the league sought to \"develop the bonds of solidarity and of universal brotherhood between all members of the black race; to bring them together for the restoration of their country of origin-Africa.\" Houénou's project, Adi tells us, was \"an aspiration that remained unrealized.\" Not only the efforts of imperial states to quash resistance and censor black publications but also internal differences of language, ideology, and orientation worked to fragment this and other efforts to consolidate and centralize Pan-Africanism. It is here that we begin to see the difficulties of viewing Pan-Africanism as one unvaried whole. Although Adi acknowledges different currents and streams, his river metaphor is too naturalistic to capture the disjuncture and disruption, the reformulation and rearticulation that characterized projects of African unity. Especially when he surveys the 1920s and '30s-arguably the high point of Pan-African cultural and political organizing-one finds the historical record replete with ephemeral organizations and publications and fleeting collaborations. Even following a single historical figure moves you through a half-dozen iterations of Pan-African politics. Take George Padmore. Born Malcolm Nurse in Arouca, Trinidad, in 1903, he began his political career by joining the Communist Party of the United States, where he lived as a student, and quickly emerged as a leading figure of the International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers and the editor of The Negro Worker from his base in Hamburg, Germany. Deported in 1933 by the Nazi police, then ousted from the party the following year for his criticism of Soviet alliances with colonial powers, Padmore briefly joined his fellow black communist Tiémoko Garan Kouyaté in Paris, where they planned a Negro World Unity congress. When growing repression and a lack of funding thwarted the group's founding, Padmore moved to London and, with fellow Trinidadian C.L.R. James, organized the International African Friends of Abyssinia (IAFA) in 1935 \"to assist by all means in their power in the maintenance of the territorial integrity and political independence of Abyssinia\" (now Ethiopia) as Italy threatened it with invasion. IAFA soon folded, however, and James and Padmore turned their efforts to a new organization, the International African Service Bureau, which would then serve as the basis for the Pan-African Federation, which organized the Fifth Pan-African Congress in 1945. Related Article When the Black Panthers Came to Algeria Elias Rodriques Writing of this interwar period, Brent Hayes Edwards has argued that the \"unforeseen alliances\" that diasporic blacks fostered \"also are characterized by unavoidable misapprehensions and misreadings, persistent blindnesses and solipsisms, self-defeating and abortive collaborations, a failure to translate even a basic grammar of blackness.\" This is not to say that visions of Pan-Africanism were futile from the outset but instead only to note the experimental and improvisational character of the projects taken up in its name and to acknowledge the linguistic, geographic, and ideological tensions against which Pan-Africanists labored. A ttending to the fragmentary quality of Pan-Africanism helps us make better sense of the discontinuities and reversals so presciently outlined in A Wreath for Udomo . The postwar phase of Pan-Africanism was unassimilable into a single movement or project, in part because the very premise of decolonization appeared to confine anticolonial activists to the territorially bound nation-state, undermining the transnational and nonterritorial scope of Pan-Africa. Following earlier histories of Pan-Africanism, Adi describes the shift of Pan-African activity from imperial metropoles to postcolonial Ghana and other newly independent states as the Pan-Africanists' \"return home.\" Yet such a reading narrows the scope of Pan-Africanism's internationalist ambitions; it becomes a black Zionism in search of a national homeland. To be sure, repatriation has always featured prominently in the African diasporic imagination, and so has the thirst for national independence. Reflecting in 1971 on The Black Jacobins , his classic 1938 history of the Haitian Revolution, James noted, \"It was written about Africa. It wasn't written about the Caribbean.\" Yet what mattered for him was not that Pan-Africanism might return home but that the Caribbean was the terrain on which African independence could be worked out. But even the achievement of African independence was not the end point, in his view. It was just the beginning of a global political and economic transformation-a world revolution that would simultaneously defeat white supremacy and capitalism. Nurturing a commitment to a Pan-Africa that exceeded a continental cartography, James was ambivalent about a politics that directed its energy primarily toward nation-state building and worried that despite the best intentions of the new generation of postcolonial statesmen, the trappings of state sovereignty would soon thwart their larger ambitions of securing African unity and building a racially egalitarian international order. The shift of Pan-African activity from imperial metropoles to the African continent and from international networks to postcolonial nation-states is perhaps Pan-Africanism's most contentious and uncertain moment-one that exposed the fragile suturing of difference and unity. The emergence of independent states like Ghana and Tanzania-led by two advocates of African socialism, Nkrumah and Julius Nyerere-created institutional and ideological openings to realize African unity. Yet the achievement of state sovereignty also worked to stymie more radical visions of Pan-Africanism. When the Sixth Pan-African Congress was convened in Dar es Salaam in 1974, the Guyanese historian Walter Rodney warned that a majority of congress attendants would be spokespersons of \"African and Caribbean states which in so many ways represent the negation of Pan-Africanism.\" Having been denied reentry into Jamaica in 1968 for his support of Black Power activism, Rodney was intimately familiar with the conservative bent of the new postcolonial states. By 1974, Abrahams's call for a Socialist United States of Africa had given away to the tepid Organization of African Unity (OAU), which supported liberation movements across the continent but remained committed to the political form of the nation-state. T he tensions inaugurated in the age of decolonization-between a black politics conscripted into a defense of the nation-state and one that aspired to succeed or transcend it-are with us today. Adi points to the OAU-sponsored First Pan-African Conference on Reparations for Slavery, Colonization and Neocolonization, which took place in 1993 in Abuja, Nigeria, as one of the starting points of a new Pan-African politics.

It was carried with the African Americans who escaped north in the Great Migration, and it traversed the African continent with figures like Abrahams's father, who traveled from his native Ethiopia to South Africa in order to find work in the mines and plantations of a voracious new imperialism. Black sailors and migrant workers in the circum-Caribbean and in southern Africa clandestinely distributed UNIA's newspaper, Negro World . The Comintern-funded Negro Worker , the Paris-based Le Cri des Nègres , and countless other black newspapers and magazines carried news of a global Africa along similar networks. After formal decolonization was achieved, the message of Pan-Africanism lived on in the vernaculars of Rastafarianism and reggae music, the aesthetics of the Afro, and the global reverberations of \"Black is beautiful.\" W eaving together the institutional high politics of Pan-Africanism with its popular and cultural iterations, Adi presents his readers with a wide tapestry of black freedom dreams that challenges many of the neat divisions imposed on black intellectual and political life by historians and scholars. For instance, much has been written about the differences between Du Bois's moderate calls for imperial reform at the early Pan-African congresses and Garvey's radical demand of \"Africa for the Africans.\" But as Adi shows, the two were united in their shared aspirations for black representation within the League of Nations, and figures like Kojo Tovalou Houénou of Dahomey (now Benin), who founded the Ligue Universelle Pour la Défense de la Race Noire (Universal League for the Defense of the Black Race), deftly navigated these two visions of Pan-Africanism. He attended UNIA meetings in New York and corresponded with Du Bois in the hope of positioning his own league as an umbrella Pan-African organization. For Houénou, Africa-not a particular territory or region-was his country, and the league sought to \"develop the bonds of solidarity and of universal brotherhood between all members of the black race; to bring them together for the restoration of their country of origin-Africa.\" Houénou's project, Adi tells us, was \"an aspiration that remained unrealized.\" Not only the efforts of imperial states to quash resistance and censor black publications but also internal differences of language, ideology, and orientation worked to fragment this and other efforts to consolidate and centralize Pan-Africanism. It is here that we begin to see the difficulties of viewing Pan-Africanism as one unvaried whole. Although Adi acknowledges different currents and streams, his river metaphor is too naturalistic to capture the disjuncture and disruption, the reformulation and rearticulation that characterized projects of African unity. Especially when he surveys the 1920s and '30s-arguably the high point of Pan-African cultural and political organizing-one finds the historical record replete with ephemeral organizations and publications and fleeting collaborations. Even following a single historical figure moves you through a half-dozen iterations of Pan-African politics. Take George Padmore. Born Malcolm Nurse in Arouca, Trinidad, in 1903, he began his political career by joining the Communist Party of the United States, where he lived as a student, and quickly emerged as a leading figure of the International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers and the editor of The Negro Worker from his base in Hamburg, Germany. Deported in 1933 by the Nazi police, then ousted from the party the following year for his criticism of Soviet alliances with colonial powers, Padmore briefly joined his fellow black communist Tiémoko Garan Kouyaté in Paris, where they planned a Negro World Unity congress. When growing repression and a lack of funding thwarted the group's founding, Padmore moved to London and, with fellow Trinidadian C.L.R. James, organized the International African Friends of Abyssinia (IAFA) in 1935 \"to assist by all means in their power in the maintenance of the territorial integrity and political independence of Abyssinia\" (now Ethiopia) as Italy threatened it with invasion. IAFA soon folded, however, and James and Padmore turned their efforts to a new organization, the International African Service Bureau, which would then serve as the basis for the Pan-African Federation, which organized the Fifth Pan-African Congress in 1945. Related Article When the Black Panthers Came to Algeria Elias Rodriques Writing of this interwar period, Brent Hayes Edwards has argued that the \"unforeseen alliances\" that diasporic blacks fostered \"also are characterized by unavoidable misapprehensions and misreadings, persistent blindnesses and solipsisms, self-defeating and abortive collaborations, a failure to translate even a basic grammar of blackness.\" This is not to say that visions of Pan-Africanism were futile from the outset but instead only to note the experimental and improvisational character of the projects taken up in its name and to acknowledge the linguistic, geographic, and ideological tensions against which Pan-Africanists labored. A ttending to the fragmentary quality of Pan-Africanism helps us make better sense of the discontinuities and reversals so presciently outlined in A Wreath for Udomo . The postwar phase of Pan-Africanism was unassimilable into a single movement or project, in part because the very premise of decolonization appeared to confine anticolonial activists to the territorially bound nation-state, undermining the transnational and nonterritorial scope of Pan-Africa. Following earlier histories of Pan-Africanism, Adi describes the shift of Pan-African activity from imperial metropoles to postcolonial Ghana and other newly independent states as the Pan-Africanists' \"return home.\" Yet such a reading narrows the scope of Pan-Africanism's internationalist ambitions; it becomes a black Zionism in search of a national homeland. To be sure, repatriation has always featured prominently in the African diasporic imagination, and so has the thirst for national independence. Reflecting in 1971 on The Black Jacobins , his classic 1938 history of the Haitian Revolution, James noted, \"It was written about Africa. It wasn't written about the Caribbean.\" Yet what mattered for him was not that Pan-Africanism might return home but that the Caribbean was the terrain on which African independence could be worked out. But even the achievement of African independence was not the end point, in his view. It was just the beginning of a global political and economic transformation-a world revolution that would simultaneously defeat white supremacy and capitalism. Nurturing a commitment to a Pan-Africa that exceeded a continental cartography, James was ambivalent about a politics that directed its energy primarily toward nation-state building and worried that despite the best intentions of the new generation of postcolonial statesmen, the trappings of state sovereignty would soon thwart their larger ambitions of securing African unity and building a racially egalitarian international order. The shift of Pan-African activity from imperial metropoles to the African continent and from international networks to postcolonial nation-states is perhaps Pan-Africanism's most contentious and uncertain moment-one that exposed the fragile suturing of difference and unity. The emergence of independent states like Ghana and Tanzania-led by two advocates of African socialism, Nkrumah and Julius Nyerere-created institutional and ideological openings to realize African unity. Yet the achievement of state sovereignty also worked to stymie more radical visions of Pan-Africanism. When the Sixth Pan-African Congress was convened in Dar es Salaam in 1974, the Guyanese historian Walter Rodney warned that a majority of congress attendants would be spokespersons of \"African and Caribbean states which in so many ways represent the negation of Pan-Africanism.\" Having been denied reentry into Jamaica in 1968 for his support of Black Power activism, Rodney was intimately familiar with the conservative bent of the new postcolonial states. By 1974, Abrahams's call for a Socialist United States of Africa had given away to the tepid Organization of African Unity (OAU), which supported liberation movements across the continent but remained committed to the political form of the nation-state. T he tensions inaugurated in the age of decolonization-between a black politics conscripted into a defense of the nation-state and one that aspired to succeed or transcend it-are with us today. Adi points to the OAU-sponsored First Pan-African Conference on Reparations for Slavery, Colonization and Neocolonization, which took place in 1993 in Abuja, Nigeria, as one of the starting points of a new Pan-African politics. The Abuja proclamation declared that \"the damage sustained by the African peoples is not a 'thing of the past' but is painfully manifest in the damaged lives of contemporary Africans from Harlem to Harare, in the damaged economies of the Black World from Guinea to Guyana, from Somalia to Suriname.\" Yet at the 2001 World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination and Xenophobia in Durban, South Africa, the geopolitical fractures of the black world frustrated a collective call for reparations. While Nigeria's then-President Olusegun Obasanjo told the conference that an apology from the European states that had imposed slavery and colonialism would suffice, Nigerian activists and civil society organizations joined the Caribbean states in demanding a more expansive program of repair. Despite the differences that have undermined Pan-Africanism throughout its existence, Adi is right to reject accounts that reduce its staying power to \"a matter of hazy vague emotions-a vision or a dream.\" The promise of Pan-Africanism was always much more than that. Like most political ideals, it helped galvanize generations into taking action. But as much as Pan-Africanism was an organized movement, it was also a sensibility, a culture, and a lived experience-guises in which it continues to shape contemporary life. Whereas black skin had been an epithet-famously captured by Frantz Fanon in the moment when a white French child pointed at him and said, \"Look, a Negro!\"-Pan-Africanism made it into a resource for imagining a radically egalitarian future. Out of forced exile and dispersal, it built a Black World, and from the depths of slavery, it limned the outlines of a fuller freedom in its songs of redemption.

Meetings like the 1900 Pan-African Conference and its successors might suggest that these forms of mobility were limited to a small male elite. But as Adi highlights, the official spaces of Pan-Africanism relied on women's labor, even if women were marginalized. The 1900 conference, best remembered for Du Bois's evocative formulation of the global color line, was in fact co-organized by Alice Victoria Kinloch of South Africa, who emerged as a critic of black oppression in her homeland before moving to Britain in 1896. Garvey's wives Amy Ashwood and Amy Jacques, as well as Garveyite women like Mamie De Mena and Henrietta Vinton Davis, also contributed to the successful expansion of UNIA as they advanced women's causes within the organization. The Martinican sisters Paulette and Jane Nardal, as students in Paris during the 1920s, convened gatherings of black students and exiles and helped black print culture to proliferate. In an article for the inaugural issue of La Dépêche Africaine ( The African Dispatch ), Jane Nardal articulated the emergence of a new \" Internationalisme Noir \" (Black Internationalism). \"Blacks of all origins and nationalities, with different customs and religions,\" she argued, \"vaguely sense that they belong in spite of everything to a single and same race.... From now on there will be a certain interest, a certain originality, a certain pride in being black, in turning back towards Africa, cradle of the blacks, in recalling a common origin.\" Outside the rarefied conferences and chance meetings in imperial metropoles like London and Paris, the vision of a global Africa was lived and enacted in everyday life and culture by millions who remain anonymous to history.

A ttending to the fragmentary quality of Pan-Africanism helps us make better sense of the discontinuities and reversals so presciently outlined in A Wreath for Udomo . The postwar phase of Pan-Africanism was unassimilable into a single movement or project, in part because the very premise of decolonization appeared to confine anticolonial activists to the territorially bound nation-state, undermining the transnational and nonterritorial scope of Pan-Africa. Following earlier histories of Pan-Africanism, Adi describes the shift of Pan-African activity from imperial metropoles to postcolonial Ghana and other newly independent states as the Pan-Africanists' \"return home.\" Yet such a reading narrows the scope of Pan-Africanism's internationalist ambitions; it becomes a black Zionism in search of a national homeland. To be sure, repatriation has always featured prominently in the African diasporic imagination, and so has the thirst for national independence. Reflecting in 1971 on The Black Jacobins , his classic 1938 history of the Haitian Revolution, James noted, \"It was written about Africa. It wasn't written about the Caribbean.\" Yet what mattered for him was not that Pan-Africanism might return home but that the Caribbean was the terrain on which African independence could be worked out. But even the achievement of African independence was not the end point, in his view. It was just the beginning of a global political and economic transformation-a world revolution that would simultaneously defeat white supremacy and capitalism. Nurturing a commitment to a Pan-Africa that exceeded a continental cartography, James was ambivalent about a politics that directed its energy primarily toward nation-state building and worried that despite the best intentions of the new generation of postcolonial statesmen, the trappings of state sovereignty would soon thwart their larger ambitions of securing African unity and building a racially egalitarian international order. The shift of Pan-African activity from imperial metropoles to the African continent and from international networks to postcolonial nation-states is perhaps Pan-Africanism's most contentious and uncertain moment-one that exposed the fragile suturing of difference and unity. The emergence of independent states like Ghana and Tanzania-led by two advocates of African socialism, Nkrumah and Julius Nyerere-created institutional and ideological openings to realize African unity. Yet the achievement of state sovereignty also worked to stymie more radical visions of Pan-Africanism. When the Sixth Pan-African Congress was convened in Dar es Salaam in 1974, the Guyanese historian Walter Rodney warned that a majority of congress attendants would be spokespersons of \"African and Caribbean states which in so many ways represent the negation of Pan-Africanism.\" Having been denied reentry into Jamaica in 1968 for his support of Black Power activism, Rodney was intimately familiar with the conservative bent of the new postcolonial states. By 1974, Abrahams's call for a Socialist United States of Africa had given away to the tepid Organization of African Unity (OAU), which supported liberation movements across the continent but remained committed to the political form of the nation-state. T he tensions inaugurated in the age of decolonization-between a black politics conscripted into a defense of the nation-state and one that aspired to succeed or transcend it-are with us today. Adi points to the OAU-sponsored First Pan-African Conference on Reparations for Slavery, Colonization and Neocolonization, which took place in 1993 in Abuja, Nigeria, as one of the starting points of a new Pan-African politics. The Abuja proclamation declared that \"the damage sustained by the African peoples is not a 'thing of the past' but is painfully manifest in the damaged lives of contemporary Africans from Harlem to Harare, in the damaged economies of the Black World from Guinea to Guyana, from Somalia to Suriname.\" Yet at the 2001 World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination and Xenophobia in Durban, South Africa, the geopolitical fractures of the black world frustrated a collective call for reparations. While Nigeria's then-President Olusegun Obasanjo told the conference that an apology from the European states that had imposed slavery and colonialism would suffice, Nigerian activists and civil society organizations joined the Caribbean states in demanding a more expansive program of repair. Despite the differences that have undermined Pan-Africanism throughout its existence, Adi is right to reject accounts that reduce its staying power to \"a matter of hazy vague emotions-a vision or a dream.\" The promise of Pan-Africanism was always much more than that. Like most political ideals, it helped galvanize generations into taking action. But as much as Pan-Africanism was an organized movement, it was also a sensibility, a culture, and a lived experience-guises in which it continues to shape contemporary life. Whereas black skin had been an epithet-famously captured by Frantz Fanon in the moment when a white French child pointed at him and said, \"Look, a Negro!\"-Pan-Africanism made it into a resource for imagining a radically egalitarian future. Out of forced exile and dispersal, it built a Black World, and from the depths of slavery, it limned the outlines of a fuller freedom in its songs of redemption. Editor's note: The photo caption has been updated to correct which congress is featured in the image. It was not the first, but the fifth.\n\nHouénou's project, Adi tells us, was \"an aspiration that remained unrealized.\" Not only the efforts of imperial states to quash resistance and censor black publications but also internal differences of language, ideology, and orientation worked to fragment this and other efforts to consolidate and centralize Pan-Africanism. It is here that we begin to see the difficulties of viewing Pan-Africanism as one unvaried whole. Although Adi acknowledges different currents and streams, his river metaphor is too naturalistic to capture the disjuncture and disruption, the reformulation and rearticulation that characterized projects of African unity. Especially when he surveys the 1920s and '30s-arguably the high point of Pan-African cultural and political organizing-one finds the historical record replete with ephemeral organizations and publications and fleeting collaborations. Even following a single historical figure moves you through a half-dozen iterations of Pan-African politics. Take George Padmore. Born Malcolm Nurse in Arouca, Trinidad, in 1903, he began his political career by joining the Communist Party of the United States, where he lived as a student, and quickly emerged as a leading figure of the International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers and the editor of The Negro Worker from his base in Hamburg, Germany. Deported in 1933 by the Nazi police, then ousted from the party the following year for his criticism of Soviet alliances with colonial powers, Padmore briefly joined his fellow black communist Tiémoko Garan Kouyaté in Paris, where they planned a Negro World Unity congress. When growing repression and a lack of funding thwarted the group's founding, Padmore moved to London and, with fellow Trinidadian C.L.R. James, organized the International African Friends of Abyssinia (IAFA) in 1935 \"to assist by all means in their power in the maintenance of the territorial integrity and political independence of Abyssinia\" (now Ethiopia) as Italy threatened it with invasion. IAFA soon folded, however, and James and Padmore turned their efforts to a new organization, the International African Service Bureau, which would then serve as the basis for the Pan-African Federation, which organized the Fifth Pan-African Congress in 1945.

While Nigeria's then-President Olusegun Obasanjo told the conference that an apology from the European states that had imposed slavery and colonialism would suffice, Nigerian activists and civil society organizations joined the Caribbean states in demanding a more expansive program of repair. Despite the differences that have undermined Pan-Africanism throughout its existence, Adi is right to reject accounts that reduce its staying power to \"a matter of hazy vague emotions-a vision or a dream.\" The promise of Pan-Africanism was always much more than that. Like most political ideals, it helped galvanize generations into taking action. But as much as Pan-Africanism was an organized movement, it was also a sensibility, a culture, and a lived experience-guises in which it continues to shape contemporary life. Whereas black skin had been an epithet-famously captured by Frantz Fanon in the moment when a white French child pointed at him and said, \"Look, a Negro!\"-Pan-Africanism made it into a resource for imagining a radically egalitarian future. Out of forced exile and dispersal, it built a Black World, and from the depths of slavery, it limned the outlines of a fuller freedom in its songs of redemption. Editor's note: The photo caption has been updated to correct which congress is featured in the image. It was not the first, but the fifth.\n\nDespite the differences that have undermined Pan-Africanism throughout its existence, Adi is right to reject accounts that reduce its staying power to \"a matter of hazy vague emotions-a vision or a dream.\" The promise of Pan-Africanism was always much more than that.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Activate your online access\n\nThe Nation Classroom\n\nINDEX PAGE\n\nThis module looks at the racial politics of the \"roaring twenties,\" a time of economic prosperity and modernism in the aftermath of World War I. Also called the Jazz Age, the era brought dramatic social, cultural, and political change-including women's suffrage, Prohibition, and the great blossoming of African-American artistic expression known as the Harlem Renaissance. For black Americans, however, the 1920s were a time of codified discrimination (Jim Crow laws) and brutal racism-including lynchings, riots, and the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nStudents will review excerpts from The Nation 's coverage of these trends in the context of African-American experiences. They will evaluate the events of that decade, identify the relationships between them, and explain their historical significance-the role these events played in the civil-rights struggle. Students and teachers have links to PDFs of every article cited in the document section.\n\nStudents work with this content to practice skills for the DBQ (document-based question) portion of the AP US History exam. The DBQ to be answered in this module is:\n\nIn the 1920s, Americans had widely differing opinions about the proper status of African-Americans in US society. Discuss those contrasting ideas, and demonstrate ways in which they were expressed during the decade.\n\nPERIOD SUMMARY: As some 350,000 African-American US soldiers returned from service in World War I (1914-1918), they found the injustices of their home nation unchanged. Racist Jim Crow laws enforced segregation and unequal citizenship in the South. Determined to find a better life, some half a million black southerners moved to the industrial cities of the North. There, they competed with white immigrants for jobs and housing, which increased tensions between the races.\n\nBefore World War I, the NAACP had just 9000 members nationwide and only 300 in the South, but by the early 1920s, national membership had risen to 100,000, with Southern chapters constituting a slight majority. African-Americans had returned home from the war with new and contagious confidence and assertiveness.\n\nIn the \"Red Summer\" of 1919, a widespread series of urban race riots broke out, initiated by whites, in which scores of black people were lynched and thousands were terrorized-while law-enforcement and government representatives generally did nothing. Many African-American veterans played an active role in defending their communities during Red Summer. In 1921, mobs of white residents attacked black residents and businesses in the Greenwood District in Tulsa, Oklahoma in what has been called \"the single worst incident of racial violence in American history.\" The attack destroyed the thriving business district known as the \"Black Wall Street,\" then the most affluent black community in the United States, along with surrounding residential area and resulted in as many 300 deaths.\n\nDespite this atmosphere of noxious racism, African-Americans achieved extraordinary things in the arts, education, sports, and other fields during these years. In particular, black artists created enduring literary, musical, and visual-arts works in a movement known as the Harlem Renaissance, a turning point in black cultural history which helped African-American writers and artists gain control over the representation of black culture and experience in Western high culture.\n\nLESSON-PLAN COMPONENTS\n\nCLASS LESSON PLAN\n\nOBJECTIVE: Explore the opposing forces that defined African-American experience and identity in the period from 1919 to 1929, and have students construct an argument explaining the effect of that era on the advancement of civil rights.\n\nSTANDARDS: Related Thematic Learning Objectives (Focus of AP Exam Questions) - NAT-4.0: Analyze relationships among different regional, social, ethnic, and racial groups, and explain how these groups' experiences have related to US national identity. - POL-3.0: Explain how different beliefs about the federal government's role in US social and economic life have affected political debates and policies.\n\n- CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RH.11-12.1 : Cite specific textual evidence to support analysis of primary and secondary sources, connecting insights gained from specific details to an understanding of the text as a whole.\n\n- CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RH.11-12.2 : Determine the central ideas or information of a primary or secondary source; provide an accurate summary that makes clear the relationships among the key details and ideas.\n\nMATERIALS: Seven Document Excerpts Document ONE: \"Wanted, A More Excellent Way,\" letter to the editor by Claude McKay, The Nation , August 16, 1919\n\nDocument TWO: \"A Question of Democracy\" by Faith Adams, The Nation , November 10, 1920\n\nDocument THREE: \"The Eruption of Tulsa\" by Walter F.

(Rick Perlstein) Even in a country that suffers from an official cult of optimism, where the dominant response to revelations that the entire nation is being spied upon is \"if you've done nothing wrong, you don't have anything to hide,\" where racism is supposed to be over because we've elected a black president even if the number of death threats against him reportedly dwarf those against previous presidents, it can useful to count victories, to record how far we have come-if only for the sake of our sanity. A friend of mine recently showed me a page of a book she dug up, an ancient Rand-McNally Grammar School Geography from 1911. With voice-of-God confidence, it defines the various \"races.\" Indians? \"Few of them have ever attained the stage of civilization. Agriculture and the arts are rudimentary, and letters and science are generally wanting.\" (There is a regional slur, too: \"South of the United States the majority of the population are still of Indian blood.\") Then the \"Black or Ethiopan Race\"-those words in bold. \"The head is long and narrow, with projecting jaws\" (projecting jaws?). \"Among them are found the lowest savages; some have advanced [ advanced! ] to barbarism; but no people of the black race ever became civilized without help from some other race.\" Study questions: \"Look among your acquaintances for persons who display, in the greatest perfection, one or more of the characteristics of the Caucasian race. What colors of hair and eyes are generally found in the same person? Which is more common, straight or wavy hair? What color of hair is most common. Did you ever see a Chinaman? Describe him...\" Did \"you\" ever see a Chinaman? If you are reading the book you are are, definitionally, not a Chinaman. It's an old book, granted. But not innocent because of that fact: it is, after all, a grammar school book, which means that it shaped the world-pictures of grownups for generations later-for instance, the respondents to a Newsweek poll around the time of the 1963 March on Washington . \"I don't like to touch them,\" one said. \"It just makes me squeamish.\" \"It's the idea of rubbing up against them,\" said another. \"It won't rub off, but I don't feel right either.\" Majorities thought black people \"laugh a lot,\" tend to have less ambition\" and \"smell different.\" When I was a kid my parents had a book in their library called Training You to Train Your Dog (1965).

This September Ig Publishing will be coming out with a new edition of Vance Packard's book on privacy, The Naked Society , which came out that year; I've written a new introduction. In the book, Packard witnessed the following stunning colloquy between a polygraph operator and said job applicant: \"Ever fired for cause?\" \"'Never.\" \"Ever drink to excess?\" \"I've been loaded a few times, but I guess that's not 'excess,' so I'll say no.\" [...] \"Have you ever done something that you are really truly ashamed of?\" Bill shook his head. My guide whispered, \"That question will sometimes smoke out the homosexual.\"... Bill was unharnessed.... The examination seemingly was over, and Bill was looking for his hat. Then Mr. Probe said pleasantly, \"Bill, one more question before you leave. There is nothing personal or offensive about this, but because of the kind of business you are going in and the fact you have been in the summer theater work, I think I should ask it. Are you inclined to be a homosexual?\" Bill looked startled. He said, \"No.\" But the question so unsettled him that he felt compelled to explain his situation. \"I have of course been surrounded by them in my work in the theater in the MIdwest, and I've been exposed to this a lot in some of the bohemian areas where I've liked, and I have been approached. But the answer is no.\" Mr. Probe didn't explain why sexual status had any significant relevance to the job for which Bill was applying. And that, today, is unimaginable. Are we out of the woods? Hell to the no. Yesterday I accompanied a group of 10-, 11- and 12-year-old boys to Great America, the theme park halfway between Milwaukee and Chicago.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

After another group of young athletes raised their fists just as he did alongside Tommie Smith at the 1968 Summer Games, Dr. Carlos traveled to Washington, DC, for the opening of the National Museum of African American History and Culture and the unveiling of a statue bearing his likeness. Then it was on to the White House, where Dr. Carlos, Tommie Smith and all of the 2016 Summer Olympians were greeted by President Obama. It was the first time either man had been greeted at the White House. I spoke to him during the whirl of this wild week. The following is an edited transcript, and the full audio interview is embedded at the bottom of the page. Dave Zirin: What does it feel like to see people who are, in some cases, not even 12 years old, let alone 20 or 30, taking the field, raising their fist, and saying they are doing it in the tradition of what you did with Tommie Smith in 1968? Dr. John Carlos : I feel like they've done their homework. I don't think we followed our history. Back in the '40s and '30s and 20's, there was a thing called Black History that would be passed down among the parents and the grandparents. So it gives me the impression, today, that maybe I was a gardener or horticulturist or someone that tilled the earth, planted the seeds, watered the garden, and what you see in these young individuals is the fruit of my labor. They understood what happened at that particular time, they used the slide rule to see whether we have really progressed in this nation as a race of people and they feel that we can go farther and we're pushing the ball up the road to get there. What words of advice do you have to people who are young, who are modeling themselves after you in so many ways and now feeling a terrible backlash? Death threats are part of the game. For those that stood for what was right in society throughout the annals of time, they've always had people who've preyed upon them and threats against their lives, but the issue is greater than one's life. People want change and they want change now, and they're willing to step up and be that sacrificial lamb, because when you think about the halls of justice, it moves slower than a snail's pace. So, you know, as I did what I did 48 years ago, it wasn't for John Carlos at that particular time, but it was for Malik Carlos and Kimme Carlos and all my kids and their peers and their grandkids, to make it a better playing field for them. We have to take the initiative to start somewhere. And God seems to send us back, like Harry Belafonte was there, John Carlos was there, Paul Robeson was there, there's always someone that's going to come up with a clear mind and a strong heart and a desire to make this a better society. What's your impression of Colin Kaepernick? I think Colin Kaepernick is a gifted individual. He sees something wrong, as I did as a young man, and he chose to sacrifice himself to make a statement for all people. His whole thing was not about burning up the American flag. His thing is about dealing with America straight on, as I did 48 years ago, to tell them that there's something wrong within the system. He didn't say that all police are bad, he just said that they have certain police that's bad and you need to look at yourself to try and weed this thing out.

When you see an individual die because he's selling loose cigarettes or you see an individual kid die because he's in the park with a cap gun, well, where else is a kid supposed to be than in a park with a cap gun? When you see a young lady get picked up for a traffic citation, next thing she knows, she's hung in a jail cell, these things need to be investigated and when you sit back and think about the investigations, there have never been any prosecutions. No one pays the price for these individuals. You were at the opening ceremonies of the National Museum of African American History and Culture where there is a statue of you and Tommie Smith and Peter Norman.What was it like to be at the opening ceremonies? If I was to put it in a phrase and say what I think about the museum, I have to think back to our lord and savior, the guy that they said made miracles, because they have made a miracle here on Earth. That's how deep this particular museum is. I don't think he left a stone unturned, I think that people are extremely emotional and excited about what they've seen in the museum. I feel that the design of the museum has taken the nation's capital to a new level, a new zone in terms of its structure, letting them know that it's a new day. Now, to see the statue there of myself, it makes you reflect on your kids and your kids' kids and their kids on down the line. When I was a youngster, my father gave all of my siblings the value of the family name, Carlos. He told us, \"Whatever we do in life, don't do anything to shame or to embarrass or tarnish the family name.\" So it brings tears to my eyes now just to talk about it. To think that our name will be in the annals of time. That statement, is not a statement for self, but it's a statement for society, for humanity and for the Carlos name to be attached to that statement is remarkable. I smile to myself to think that my grandkids will come up and say that's your pop-pop there or that's your great-great-grandfather there and it gives them the encouragement to do the right thing and stand behind what you do. There's a big difference, though, with this statue of Tommie Smith and you that stands at San Jose State, and that's Peter Norman. Peter Norman, the silver medalist from Australia, who, of course, stood with Tommie Smith and you and wore a button that said \"Olympic Project for Human Rights.\" He's not there at San Jose, but he is on the medal stand and part of the statue at the Smithsonian. Why is that? When the statue came about at the museum and I said, \"It's great that you guys are putting a statue up of Tommie and I, but it's imperative that you put Peter Norman up there as well. I said, because your job is to educate the masses through this museum and they would never be educated in the museum of African-American culture and history, it would never be true history if Peter Norman is not there. And then I had to remind him also that we don't want it to be a situation like John Brown. John Brown should have statues in and around the United States as well. We don't want him to be forgotten, as well as we don't want Peter Norman to be forgotten for his contributions to having an equal playing field for all races, particularly the black race. Is there a fear that when they make a statue out of you, that it's a way to sort of like make you safe, to extract your political teeth? No, not really, because that symbol is so revealing and so strong, for years after I'm dead and gone that symbol will still inspire and motivate individuals to seek out higher ground and to push the stone up the road, to making a better society for all people. Now, that's a eternal job. It's not a job that you say in 10 months, or 10 years or 25 years the job will be done. It's an eternal job. You're going to do this job as long as the bubble spins! You are also going to the White House this week. What is that about? That's incredible to think that I'm going to the White House, and once again I can say 48 years later from my involvement in the Olympics itself. I would hope that my teammates from the 1968 team, one day, will one day have their day at the White House as well, but at this particular time, Tommie Smith and I will be going to the White House as a part of the 2016 Olympic team that did so well. I take my hat off to all of the team, the women of the team in particular, for track and field, because the women came through big-time. So we have to respect and honor their good deeds. But, relative to going to the White House, man, it's a very emotional thing for me, in a sense that my father was in the First World War. Gave up blood, had relatives in the Second World War and the Korean War and none of them, I don't think, ever got close enough to the president of the nation that they stood for. For me to go, for my wife to be there by my side, I don't think it gets any greater than that. To be able to shake the president's hand, the first black president of the United States, that would be something that would linger through my mind. This is also tied to an apology that's being put forward by the United States Olympic Committee for how they treated you and Dr. Smith, is that correct? I don't know whether they're attempting an apology as much as I think what they did is lowered the drawbridge and were willing to come across the drawbridge to greet us with open arms. I think they made it clear to me that they had a charter and they have rules and regulations that were instilled in the Olympic process, I guess at the beginning, and they feel that I crossed the line with my statement. However, they did express that we feel that what you did was the right movement and thought to say that you stand for justice and equality for all people. They admired the strength that we had to endure the pain and sacrifice we had [made] by making that statement. They acknowledged the fact that we haven't wavered from what our beliefs were at that particular time. And they reiterated that we agree with your statement, we just disagree with [you using] the podium for doing it. I can accept that. But relative to an apology, well, people always ask me, would you be happy with an apology from the USOC? I don't really feel that the USOC owes me an apology, but an apology is owed by an individual American by the name of Mr. Brent Musburger. Brent Musburger owes you an apology. Absolutely. I think I'm offended by the statements that Brent Musburger made, and I think every American, true American, should be offended by the statement that he made in reference to Dr. Smith and myself. You're talking about in 1968, as a young reporter for the Chicago American , Brent Musburger described you and Tommie Smith as \"black-skinned storm troopers.\" Absolutely. So what he's calling me is a neo-Nazi. So I guess, based on what we were fighting for at that particular time, if America accepted his statement towards us to call us neo-Nazis or fascists or whatever you might want to call it, then America is just acknowledging that maybe Kaepernick is right, maybe John Carlos is right, or all those civil activists down the line have been right. When a white individual can call a national figure in the Olympics games a black-skinned storm trooper and American society let it go? That's racism in itself. So if anyone owes an apology, it's Brent Musburger. And just to think about the fact that he made millions of dollars on the backs of so many young blacks that are out there playing every Saturday, and I would say that 99.9 percent of them have no idea that he called us black storm troopers. Do you think police violence and racism are actually getting worse now or do you think it's just a question of us being more aware? I think it's getting worse in the sense that, you know, we didn't have social media when I was a kid. What we did have, we had community policing. When I say community policing, I'm talking about, we had police that would beat police. They walked the streets, they knew the people in the community, the people in the community knew them. Some of them, we'd go to the people's houses to have lunch or dinner. They knew the kids in the community. If a kid did something and he was going the wrong way, they wouldn't throw him on the ground, face down, they wouldn't shackle him, drag him out, or shoot him or beat him up, they might take him home and let his parents deal with him and make him realize what you're doing is wrong. We no longer have a beat police. Used to be years ago, two riding in the car, now it's one riding in the car. They circle a whole area like they're herding cattle, to keep them in their stables, so to speak. So there's no relationship with them. If you look at something that's supposed to be less than you, that's less than you, whether it be sheep or cattle, and when it gets out. Well, what [do we do to the] sheep when it gets out and keeps getting out? They take the prod and put the prod on you, give you some shock treatment. Let them know that if you come through this gate, you're going to get lit up again. And that's the attitude that they have amongst certain police within these various agencies across the nation. I'm watching the cattle. If I have to take down one of the cattle because he stepped out of line, I'll do it. We have to make sure that the police department is responsible for their policing. We're not saying that the police, universally, is a bad situation. We're saying that you have bad elements within your agency and it's your responsibility, your job, you take the oath to protect the public. If you're not protecting the public because your own people are committing atrocities, then you have to take an inward look for yourself to deal with these atrocities that are happening from your agency. Simple as that. You know, that's all that young man is doing right now by taking a knee, saying, America has to take a better look at itself. If you remember back in 1968, when I was on the podium, I had a black shirt on to cover up my USA jersey. I didn't cover up my jersey because I was mad at United States. I covered my jersey because I was ashamed of the United States. There's a difference in being mad at someone and being ashamed of someone, and I was ashamed because all the projection that America had put out through the world, it was a farce, relative to where I was standing, and I felt that America could have done and should have done better. That's all these people are saying today. America, you can and you should do better.\n\nDave Zirin: What does it feel like to see people who are, in some cases, not even 12 years old, let alone 20 or 30, taking the field, raising their fist, and saying they are doing it in the tradition of what you did with Tommie Smith in 1968? Dr. John Carlos : I feel like they've done their homework. I don't think we followed our history. Back in the '40s and '30s and 20's, there was a thing called Black History that would be passed down among the parents and the grandparents. So it gives me the impression, today, that maybe I was a gardener or horticulturist or someone that tilled the earth, planted the seeds, watered the garden, and what you see in these young individuals is the fruit of my labor. They understood what happened at that particular time, they used the slide rule to see whether we have really progressed in this nation as a race of people and they feel that we can go farther and we're pushing the ball up the road to get there. What words of advice do you have to people who are young, who are modeling themselves after you in so many ways and now feeling a terrible backlash? Death threats are part of the game. For those that stood for what was right in society throughout the annals of time, they've always had people who've preyed upon them and threats against their lives, but the issue is greater than one's life. People want change and they want change now, and they're willing to step up and be that sacrificial lamb, because when you think about the halls of justice, it moves slower than a snail's pace. So, you know, as I did what I did 48 years ago, it wasn't for John Carlos at that particular time, but it was for Malik Carlos and Kimme Carlos and all my kids and their peers and their grandkids, to make it a better playing field for them. We have to take the initiative to start somewhere. And God seems to send us back, like Harry Belafonte was there, John Carlos was there, Paul Robeson was there, there's always someone that's going to come up with a clear mind and a strong heart and a desire to make this a better society. What's your impression of Colin Kaepernick? I think Colin Kaepernick is a gifted individual. He sees something wrong, as I did as a young man, and he chose to sacrifice himself to make a statement for all people. His whole thing was not about burning up the American flag. His thing is about dealing with America straight on, as I did 48 years ago, to tell them that there's something wrong within the system. He didn't say that all police are bad, he just said that they have certain police that's bad and you need to look at yourself to try and weed this thing out.

When you see an individual die because he's selling loose cigarettes or you see an individual kid die because he's in the park with a cap gun, well, where else is a kid supposed to be than in a park with a cap gun? When you see a young lady get picked up for a traffic citation, next thing she knows, she's hung in a jail cell, these things need to be investigated and when you sit back and think about the investigations, there have never been any prosecutions. No one pays the price for these individuals. You were at the opening ceremonies of the National Museum of African American History and Culture where there is a statue of you and Tommie Smith and Peter Norman.What was it like to be at the opening ceremonies? If I was to put it in a phrase and say what I think about the museum, I have to think back to our lord and savior, the guy that they said made miracles, because they have made a miracle here on Earth. That's how deep this particular museum is. I don't think he left a stone unturned, I think that people are extremely emotional and excited about what they've seen in the museum. I feel that the design of the museum has taken the nation's capital to a new level, a new zone in terms of its structure, letting them know that it's a new day. Now, to see the statue there of myself, it makes you reflect on your kids and your kids' kids and their kids on down the line. When I was a youngster, my father gave all of my siblings the value of the family name, Carlos. He told us, \"Whatever we do in life, don't do anything to shame or to embarrass or tarnish the family name.\" So it brings tears to my eyes now just to talk about it. To think that our name will be in the annals of time. That statement, is not a statement for self, but it's a statement for society, for humanity and for the Carlos name to be attached to that statement is remarkable. I smile to myself to think that my grandkids will come up and say that's your pop-pop there or that's your great-great-grandfather there and it gives them the encouragement to do the right thing and stand behind what you do. There's a big difference, though, with this statue of Tommie Smith and you that stands at San Jose State, and that's Peter Norman. Peter Norman, the silver medalist from Australia, who, of course, stood with Tommie Smith and you and wore a button that said \"Olympic Project for Human Rights.\" He's not there at San Jose, but he is on the medal stand and part of the statue at the Smithsonian. Why is that? When the statue came about at the museum and I said, \"It's great that you guys are putting a statue up of Tommie and I, but it's imperative that you put Peter Norman up there as well. I said, because your job is to educate the masses through this museum and they would never be educated in the museum of African-American culture and history, it would never be true history if Peter Norman is not there. And then I had to remind him also that we don't want it to be a situation like John Brown. John Brown should have statues in and around the United States as well. We don't want him to be forgotten, as well as we don't want Peter Norman to be forgotten for his contributions to having an equal playing field for all races, particularly the black race. Is there a fear that when they make a statue out of you, that it's a way to sort of like make you safe, to extract your political teeth? No, not really, because that symbol is so revealing and so strong, for years after I'm dead and gone that symbol will still inspire and motivate individuals to seek out higher ground and to push the stone up the road, to making a better society for all people. Now, that's a eternal job. It's not a job that you say in 10 months, or 10 years or 25 years the job will be done. It's an eternal job. You're going to do this job as long as the bubble spins! You are also going to the White House this week. What is that about? That's incredible to think that I'm going to the White House, and once again I can say 48 years later from my involvement in the Olympics itself. I would hope that my teammates from the 1968 team, one day, will one day have their day at the White House as well, but at this particular time, Tommie Smith and I will be going to the White House as a part of the 2016 Olympic team that did so well. I take my hat off to all of the team, the women of the team in particular, for track and field, because the women came through big-time. So we have to respect and honor their good deeds.

To be able to shake the president's hand, the first black president of the United States, that would be something that would linger through my mind.

I'm watching the cattle. If I have to take down one of the cattle because he stepped out of line, I'll do it. We have to make sure that the police department is responsible for their policing. We're not saying that the police, universally, is a bad situation. We're saying that you have bad elements within your agency and it's your responsibility, your job, you take the oath to protect the public. If you're not protecting the public because your own people are committing atrocities, then you have to take an inward look for yourself to deal with these atrocities that are happening from your agency. Simple as that. You know, that's all that young man is doing right now by taking a knee, saying, America has to take a better look at itself. If you remember back in 1968, when I was on the podium, I had a black shirt on to cover up my USA jersey. I didn't cover up my jersey because I was mad at United States. I covered my jersey because I was ashamed of the United States. There's a difference in being mad at someone and being ashamed of someone, and I was ashamed because all the projection that America had put out through the world, it was a farce, relative to where I was standing, and I felt that America could have done and should have done better. That's all these people are saying today. America, you can and you should do better.\n\nWhat words of advice do you have to people who are young, who are modeling themselves after you in so many ways and now feeling a terrible backlash? Death threats are part of the game. For those that stood for what was right in society throughout the annals of time, they've always had people who've preyed upon them and threats against their lives, but the issue is greater than one's life. People want change and they want change now, and they're willing to step up and be that sacrificial lamb, because when you think about the halls of justice, it moves slower than a snail's pace. So, you know, as I did what I did 48 years ago, it wasn't for John Carlos at that particular time, but it was for Malik Carlos and Kimme Carlos and all my kids and their peers and their grandkids, to make it a better playing field for them. We have to take the initiative to start somewhere. And God seems to send us back, like Harry Belafonte was there, John Carlos was there, Paul Robeson was there, there's always someone that's going to come up with a clear mind and a strong heart and a desire to make this a better society. What's your impression of Colin Kaepernick? I think Colin Kaepernick is a gifted individual. He sees something wrong, as I did as a young man, and he chose to sacrifice himself to make a statement for all people. His whole thing was not about burning up the American flag. His thing is about dealing with America straight on, as I did 48 years ago, to tell them that there's something wrong within the system. He didn't say that all police are bad, he just said that they have certain police that's bad and you need to look at yourself to try and weed this thing out.

When you see an individual die because he's selling loose cigarettes or you see an individual kid die because he's in the park with a cap gun, well, where else is a kid supposed to be than in a park with a cap gun? When you see a young lady get picked up for a traffic citation, next thing she knows, she's hung in a jail cell, these things need to be investigated and when you sit back and think about the investigations, there have never been any prosecutions. No one pays the price for these individuals. You were at the opening ceremonies of the National Museum of African American History and Culture where there is a statue of you and Tommie Smith and Peter Norman.What was it like to be at the opening ceremonies? If I was to put it in a phrase and say what I think about the museum, I have to think back to our lord and savior, the guy that they said made miracles, because they have made a miracle here on Earth. That's how deep this particular museum is. I don't think he left a stone unturned, I think that people are extremely emotional and excited about what they've seen in the museum. I feel that the design of the museum has taken the nation's capital to a new level, a new zone in terms of its structure, letting them know that it's a new day. Now, to see the statue there of myself, it makes you reflect on your kids and your kids' kids and their kids on down the line. When I was a youngster, my father gave all of my siblings the value of the family name, Carlos. He told us, \"Whatever we do in life, don't do anything to shame or to embarrass or tarnish the family name.\" So it brings tears to my eyes now just to talk about it. To think that our name will be in the annals of time. That statement, is not a statement for self, but it's a statement for society, for humanity and for the Carlos name to be attached to that statement is remarkable. I smile to myself to think that my grandkids will come up and say that's your pop-pop there or that's your great-great-grandfather there and it gives them the encouragement to do the right thing and stand behind what you do. There's a big difference, though, with this statue of Tommie Smith and you that stands at San Jose State, and that's Peter Norman. Peter Norman, the silver medalist from Australia, who, of course, stood with Tommie Smith and you and wore a button that said \"Olympic Project for Human Rights.\" He's not there at San Jose, but he is on the medal stand and part of the statue at the Smithsonian. Why is that? When the statue came about at the museum and I said, \"It's great that you guys are putting a statue up of Tommie and I, but it's imperative that you put Peter Norman up there as well. I said, because your job is to educate the masses through this museum and they would never be educated in the museum of African-American culture and history, it would never be true history if Peter Norman is not there. And then I had to remind him also that we don't want it to be a situation like John Brown. John Brown should have statues in and around the United States as well. We don't want him to be forgotten, as well as we don't want Peter Norman to be forgotten for his contributions to having an equal playing field for all races, particularly the black race. Is there a fear that when they make a statue out of you, that it's a way to sort of like make you safe, to extract your political teeth? No, not really, because that symbol is so revealing and so strong, for years after I'm dead and gone that symbol will still inspire and motivate individuals to seek out higher ground and to push the stone up the road, to making a better society for all people. Now, that's a eternal job. It's not a job that you say in 10 months, or 10 years or 25 years the job will be done. It's an eternal job. You're going to do this job as long as the bubble spins! You are also going to the White House this week. What is that about? That's incredible to think that I'm going to the White House, and once again I can say 48 years later from my involvement in the Olympics itself. I would hope that my teammates from the 1968 team, one day, will one day have their day at the White House as well, but at this particular time, Tommie Smith and I will be going to the White House as a part of the 2016 Olympic team that did so well. I take my hat off to all of the team, the women of the team in particular, for track and field, because the women came through big-time. So we have to respect and honor their good deeds. But, relative to going to the White House, man, it's a very emotional thing for me, in a sense that my father was in the First World War. Gave up blood, had relatives in the Second World War and the Korean War and none of them, I don't think, ever got close enough to the president of the nation that they stood for. For me to go, for my wife to be there by my side, I don't think it gets any greater than that. To be able to shake the president's hand, the first black president of the United States, that would be something that would linger through my mind. This is also tied to an apology that's being put forward by the United States Olympic Committee for how they treated you and Dr. Smith, is that correct? I don't know whether they're attempting an apology as much as I think what they did is lowered the drawbridge and were willing to come across the drawbridge to greet us with open arms. I think they made it clear to me that they had a charter and they have rules and regulations that were instilled in the Olympic process, I guess at the beginning, and they feel that I crossed the line with my statement. However, they did express that we feel that what you did was the right movement and thought to say that you stand for justice and equality for all people. They admired the strength that we had to endure the pain and sacrifice we had [made] by making that statement. They acknowledged the fact that we haven't wavered from what our beliefs were at that particular time. And they reiterated that we agree with your statement, we just disagree with [you using] the podium for doing it. I can accept that. But relative to an apology, well, people always ask me, would you be happy with an apology from the USOC? I don't really feel that the USOC owes me an apology, but an apology is owed by an individual American by the name of Mr. Brent Musburger. Brent Musburger owes you an apology. Absolutely. I think I'm offended by the statements that Brent Musburger made, and I think every American, true American, should be offended by the statement that he made in reference to Dr. Smith and myself. You're talking about in 1968, as a young reporter for the Chicago American , Brent Musburger described you and Tommie Smith as \"black-skinned storm troopers.\" Absolutely. So what he's calling me is a neo-Nazi. So I guess, based on what we were fighting for at that particular time, if America accepted his statement towards us to call us neo-Nazis or fascists or whatever you might want to call it, then America is just acknowledging that maybe Kaepernick is right, maybe John Carlos is right, or all those civil activists down the line have been right. When a white individual can call a national figure in the Olympics games a black-skinned storm trooper and American society let it go? That's racism in itself. So if anyone owes an apology, it's Brent Musburger. And just to think about the fact that he made millions of dollars on the backs of so many young blacks that are out there playing every Saturday, and I would say that 99.9 percent of them have no idea that he called us black storm troopers. Do you think police violence and racism are actually getting worse now or do you think it's just a question of us being more aware? I think it's getting worse in the sense that, you know, we didn't have social media when I was a kid. What we did have, we had community policing. When I say community policing, I'm talking about, we had police that would beat police. They walked the streets, they knew the people in the community, the people in the community knew them. Some of them, we'd go to the people's houses to have lunch or dinner. They knew the kids in the community. If a kid did something and he was going the wrong way, they wouldn't throw him on the ground, face down, they wouldn't shackle him, drag him out, or shoot him or beat him up, they might take him home and let his parents deal with him and make him realize what you're doing is wrong. We no longer have a beat police. Used to be years ago, two riding in the car, now it's one riding in the car. They circle a whole area like they're herding cattle, to keep them in their stables, so to speak. So there's no relationship with them. If you look at something that's supposed to be less than you, that's less than you, whether it be sheep or cattle, and when it gets out. Well, what [do we do to the] sheep when it gets out and keeps getting out? They take the prod and put the prod on you, give you some shock treatment. Let them know that if you come through this gate, you're going to get lit up again. And that's the attitude that they have amongst certain police within these various agencies across the nation. I'm watching the cattle. If I have to take down one of the cattle because he stepped out of line, I'll do it. We have to make sure that the police department is responsible for their policing. We're not saying that the police, universally, is a bad situation. We're saying that you have bad elements within your agency and it's your responsibility, your job, you take the oath to protect the public. If you're not protecting the public because your own people are committing atrocities, then you have to take an inward look for yourself to deal with these atrocities that are happening from your agency. Simple as that. You know, that's all that young man is doing right now by taking a knee, saying, America has to take a better look at itself.

Is there a fear that when they make a statue out of you, that it's a way to sort of like make you safe, to extract your political teeth? No, not really, because that symbol is so revealing and so strong, for years after I'm dead and gone that symbol will still inspire and motivate individuals to seek out higher ground and to push the stone up the road, to making a better society for all people. Now, that's a eternal job. It's not a job that you say in 10 months, or 10 years or 25 years the job will be done. It's an eternal job. You're going to do this job as long as the bubble spins! You are also going to the White House this week. What is that about? That's incredible to think that I'm going to the White House, and once again I can say 48 years later from my involvement in the Olympics itself. I would hope that my teammates from the 1968 team, one day, will one day have their day at the White House as well, but at this particular time, Tommie Smith and I will be going to the White House as a part of the 2016 Olympic team that did so well. I take my hat off to all of the team, the women of the team in particular, for track and field, because the women came through big-time. So we have to respect and honor their good deeds. But, relative to going to the White House, man, it's a very emotional thing for me, in a sense that my father was in the First World War. Gave up blood, had relatives in the Second World War and the Korean War and none of them, I don't think, ever got close enough to the president of the nation that they stood for. For me to go, for my wife to be there by my side, I don't think it gets any greater than that. To be able to shake the president's hand, the first black president of the United States, that would be something that would linger through my mind. This is also tied to an apology that's being put forward by the United States Olympic Committee for how they treated you and Dr. Smith, is that correct? I don't know whether they're attempting an apology as much as I think what they did is lowered the drawbridge and were willing to come across the drawbridge to greet us with open arms. I think they made it clear to me that they had a charter and they have rules and regulations that were instilled in the Olympic process, I guess at the beginning, and they feel that I crossed the line with my statement. However, they did express that we feel that what you did was the right movement and thought to say that you stand for justice and equality for all people. They admired the strength that we had to endure the pain and sacrifice we had [made] by making that statement. They acknowledged the fact that we haven't wavered from what our beliefs were at that particular time. And they reiterated that we agree with your statement, we just disagree with [you using] the podium for doing it. I can accept that. But relative to an apology, well, people always ask me, would you be happy with an apology from the USOC? I don't really feel that the USOC owes me an apology, but an apology is owed by an individual American by the name of Mr. Brent Musburger. Brent Musburger owes you an apology. Absolutely. I think I'm offended by the statements that Brent Musburger made, and I think every American, true American, should be offended by the statement that he made in reference to Dr. Smith and myself. You're talking about in 1968, as a young reporter for the Chicago American , Brent Musburger described you and Tommie Smith as \"black-skinned storm troopers.\" Absolutely. So what he's calling me is a neo-Nazi. So I guess, based on what we were fighting for at that particular time, if America accepted his statement towards us to call us neo-Nazis or fascists or whatever you might want to call it, then America is just acknowledging that maybe Kaepernick is right, maybe John Carlos is right, or all those civil activists down the line have been right. When a white individual can call a national figure in the Olympics games a black-skinned storm trooper and American society let it go? That's racism in itself. So if anyone owes an apology, it's Brent Musburger. And just to think about the fact that he made millions of dollars on the backs of so many young blacks that are out there playing every Saturday, and I would say that 99.9 percent of them have no idea that he called us black storm troopers. Do you think police violence and racism are actually getting worse now or do you think it's just a question of us being more aware? I think it's getting worse in the sense that, you know, we didn't have social media when I was a kid. What we did have, we had community policing. When I say community policing, I'm talking about, we had police that would beat police. They walked the streets, they knew the people in the community, the people in the community knew them. Some of them, we'd go to the people's houses to have lunch or dinner. They knew the kids in the community. If a kid did something and he was going the wrong way, they wouldn't throw him on the ground, face down, they wouldn't shackle him, drag him out, or shoot him or beat him up, they might take him home and let his parents deal with him and make him realize what you're doing is wrong. We no longer have a beat police. Used to be years ago, two riding in the car, now it's one riding in the car. They circle a whole area like they're herding cattle, to keep them in their stables, so to speak. So there's no relationship with them. If you look at something that's supposed to be less than you, that's less than you, whether it be sheep or cattle, and when it gets out. Well, what [do we do to the] sheep when it gets out and keeps getting out? They take the prod and put the prod on you, give you some shock treatment. Let them know that if you come through this gate, you're going to get lit up again. And that's the attitude that they have amongst certain police within these various agencies across the nation. I'm watching the cattle. If I have to take down one of the cattle because he stepped out of line, I'll do it. We have to make sure that the police department is responsible for their policing. We're not saying that the police, universally, is a bad situation. We're saying that you have bad elements within your agency and it's your responsibility, your job, you take the oath to protect the public. If you're not protecting the public because your own people are committing atrocities, then you have to take an inward look for yourself to deal with these atrocities that are happening from your agency. Simple as that. You know, that's all that young man is doing right now by taking a knee, saying, America has to take a better look at itself. If you remember back in 1968, when I was on the podium, I had a black shirt on to cover up my USA jersey. I didn't cover up my jersey because I was mad at United States. I covered my jersey because I was ashamed of the United States. There's a difference in being mad at someone and being ashamed of someone, and I was ashamed because all the projection that America had put out through the world, it was a farce, relative to where I was standing, and I felt that America could have done and should have done better. That's all these people are saying today. America, you can and you should do better.\n\nWhat's your impression of Colin Kaepernick? I think Colin Kaepernick is a gifted individual. He sees something wrong, as I did as a young man, and he chose to sacrifice himself to make a statement for all people. His whole thing was not about burning up the American flag. His thing is about dealing with America straight on, as I did 48 years ago, to tell them that there's something wrong within the system. He didn't say that all police are bad, he just said that they have certain police that's bad and you need to look at yourself to try and weed this thing out.

When you see an individual die because he's selling loose cigarettes or you see an individual kid die because he's in the park with a cap gun, well, where else is a kid supposed to be than in a park with a cap gun? When you see a young lady get picked up for a traffic citation, next thing she knows, she's hung in a jail cell, these things need to be investigated and when you sit back and think about the investigations, there have never been any prosecutions. No one pays the price for these individuals. You were at the opening ceremonies of the National Museum of African American History and Culture where there is a statue of you and Tommie Smith and Peter Norman.What was it like to be at the opening ceremonies? If I was to put it in a phrase and say what I think about the museum, I have to think back to our lord and savior, the guy that they said made miracles, because they have made a miracle here on Earth. That's how deep this particular museum is. I don't think he left a stone unturned, I think that people are extremely emotional and excited about what they've seen in the museum. I feel that the design of the museum has taken the nation's capital to a new level, a new zone in terms of its structure, letting them know that it's a new day. Now, to see the statue there of myself, it makes you reflect on your kids and your kids' kids and their kids on down the line. When I was a youngster, my father gave all of my siblings the value of the family name, Carlos. He told us, \"Whatever we do in life, don't do anything to shame or to embarrass or tarnish the family name.\" So it brings tears to my eyes now just to talk about it. To think that our name will be in the annals of time. That statement, is not a statement for self, but it's a statement for society, for humanity and for the Carlos name to be attached to that statement is remarkable. I smile to myself to think that my grandkids will come up and say that's your pop-pop there or that's your great-great-grandfather there and it gives them the encouragement to do the right thing and stand behind what you do. There's a big difference, though, with this statue of Tommie Smith and you that stands at San Jose State, and that's Peter Norman. Peter Norman, the silver medalist from Australia, who, of course, stood with Tommie Smith and you and wore a button that said \"Olympic Project for Human Rights.\" He's not there at San Jose, but he is on the medal stand and part of the statue at the Smithsonian. Why is that? When the statue came about at the museum and I said, \"It's great that you guys are putting a statue up of Tommie and I, but it's imperative that you put Peter Norman up there as well. I said, because your job is to educate the masses through this museum and they would never be educated in the museum of African-American culture and history, it would never be true history if Peter Norman is not there. And then I had to remind him also that we don't want it to be a situation like John Brown. John Brown should have statues in and around the United States as well. We don't want him to be forgotten, as well as we don't want Peter Norman to be forgotten for his contributions to having an equal playing field for all races, particularly the black race.

I feel that the design of the museum has taken the nation's capital to a new level, a new zone in terms of its structure, letting them know that it's a new day. Now, to see the statue there of myself, it makes you reflect on your kids and your kids' kids and their kids on down the line. When I was a youngster, my father gave all of my siblings the value of the family name, Carlos. He told us, \"Whatever we do in life, don't do anything to shame or to embarrass or tarnish the family name.\" So it brings tears to my eyes now just to talk about it. To think that our name will be in the annals of time. That statement, is not a statement for self, but it's a statement for society, for humanity and for the Carlos name to be attached to that statement is remarkable. I smile to myself to think that my grandkids will come up and say that's your pop-pop there or that's your great-great-grandfather there and it gives them the encouragement to do the right thing and stand behind what you do. There's a big difference, though, with this statue of Tommie Smith and you that stands at San Jose State, and that's Peter Norman. Peter Norman, the silver medalist from Australia, who, of course, stood with Tommie Smith and you and wore a button that said \"Olympic Project for Human Rights.\" He's not there at San Jose, but he is on the medal stand and part of the statue at the Smithsonian. Why is that? When the statue came about at the museum and I said, \"It's great that you guys are putting a statue up of Tommie and I, but it's imperative that you put Peter Norman up there as well. I said, because your job is to educate the masses through this museum and they would never be educated in the museum of African-American culture and history, it would never be true history if Peter Norman is not there. And then I had to remind him also that we don't want it to be a situation like John Brown. John Brown should have statues in and around the United States as well. We don't want him to be forgotten, as well as we don't want Peter Norman to be forgotten for his contributions to having an equal playing field for all races, particularly the black race. Is there a fear that when they make a statue out of you, that it's a way to sort of like make you safe, to extract your political teeth? No, not really, because that symbol is so revealing and so strong, for years after I'm dead and gone that symbol will still inspire and motivate individuals to seek out higher ground and to push the stone up the road, to making a better society for all people. Now, that's a eternal job. It's not a job that you say in 10 months, or 10 years or 25 years the job will be done. It's an eternal job. You're going to do this job as long as the bubble spins! You are also going to the White House this week. What is that about? That's incredible to think that I'm going to the White House, and once again I can say 48 years later from my involvement in the Olympics itself. I would hope that my teammates from the 1968 team, one day, will one day have their day at the White House as well, but at this particular time, Tommie Smith and I will be going to the White House as a part of the 2016 Olympic team that did so well. I take my hat off to all of the team, the women of the team in particular, for track and field, because the women came through big-time. So we have to respect and honor their good deeds. But, relative to going to the White House, man, it's a very emotional thing for me, in a sense that my father was in the First World War. Gave up blood, had relatives in the Second World War and the Korean War and none of them, I don't think, ever got close enough to the president of the nation that they stood for. For me to go, for my wife to be there by my side, I don't think it gets any greater than that. To be able to shake the president's hand, the first black president of the United States, that would be something that would linger through my mind. This is also tied to an apology that's being put forward by the United States Olympic Committee for how they treated you and Dr. Smith, is that correct? I don't know whether they're attempting an apology as much as I think what they did is lowered the drawbridge and were willing to come across the drawbridge to greet us with open arms. I think they made it clear to me that they had a charter and they have rules and regulations that were instilled in the Olympic process, I guess at the beginning, and they feel that I crossed the line with my statement. However, they did express that we feel that what you did was the right movement and thought to say that you stand for justice and equality for all people. They admired the strength that we had to endure the pain and sacrifice we had [made] by making that statement. They acknowledged the fact that we haven't wavered from what our beliefs were at that particular time. And they reiterated that we agree with your statement, we just disagree with [you using] the podium for doing it. I can accept that. But relative to an apology, well, people always ask me, would you be happy with an apology from the USOC? I don't really feel that the USOC owes me an apology, but an apology is owed by an individual American by the name of Mr. Brent Musburger. Brent Musburger owes you an apology. Absolutely. I think I'm offended by the statements that Brent Musburger made, and I think every American, true American, should be offended by the statement that he made in reference to Dr. Smith and myself. You're talking about in 1968, as a young reporter for the Chicago American , Brent Musburger described you and Tommie Smith as \"black-skinned storm troopers.\" Absolutely. So what he's calling me is a neo-Nazi. So I guess, based on what we were fighting for at that particular time, if America accepted his statement towards us to call us neo-Nazis or fascists or whatever you might want to call it, then America is just acknowledging that maybe Kaepernick is right, maybe John Carlos is right, or all those civil activists down the line have been right. When a white individual can call a national figure in the Olympics games a black-skinned storm trooper and American society let it go? That's racism in itself. So if anyone owes an apology, it's Brent Musburger. And just to think about the fact that he made millions of dollars on the backs of so many young blacks that are out there playing every Saturday, and I would say that 99.9 percent of them have no idea that he called us black storm troopers. Do you think police violence and racism are actually getting worse now or do you think it's just a question of us being more aware? I think it's getting worse in the sense that, you know, we didn't have social media when I was a kid. What we did have, we had community policing. When I say community policing, I'm talking about, we had police that would beat police. They walked the streets, they knew the people in the community, the people in the community knew them. Some of them, we'd go to the people's houses to have lunch or dinner. They knew the kids in the community. If a kid did something and he was going the wrong way, they wouldn't throw him on the ground, face down, they wouldn't shackle him, drag him out, or shoot him or beat him up, they might take him home and let his parents deal with him and make him realize what you're doing is wrong. We no longer have a beat police. Used to be years ago, two riding in the car, now it's one riding in the car. They circle a whole area like they're herding cattle, to keep them in their stables, so to speak. So there's no relationship with them. If you look at something that's supposed to be less than you, that's less than you, whether it be sheep or cattle, and when it gets out. Well, what [do we do to the] sheep when it gets out and keeps getting out? They take the prod and put the prod on you, give you some shock treatment. Let them know that if you come through this gate, you're going to get lit up again. And that's the attitude that they have amongst certain police within these various agencies across the nation. I'm watching the cattle. If I have to take down one of the cattle because he stepped out of line, I'll do it. We have to make sure that the police department is responsible for their policing. We're not saying that the police, universally, is a bad situation. We're saying that you have bad elements within your agency and it's your responsibility, your job, you take the oath to protect the public. If you're not protecting the public because your own people are committing atrocities, then you have to take an inward look for yourself to deal with these atrocities that are happening from your agency. Simple as that. You know, that's all that young man is doing right now by taking a knee, saying, America has to take a better look at itself. If you remember back in 1968, when I was on the podium, I had a black shirt on to cover up my USA jersey. I didn't cover up my jersey because I was mad at United States. I covered my jersey because I was ashamed of the United States. There's a difference in being mad at someone and being ashamed of someone, and I was ashamed because all the projection that America had put out through the world, it was a farce, relative to where I was standing, and I felt that America could have done and should have done better. That's all these people are saying today. America, you can and you should do better.\n\nYou were at the opening ceremonies of the National Museum of African American History and Culture where there is a statue of you and Tommie Smith and Peter Norman.What was it like to be at the opening ceremonies? If I was to put it in a phrase and say what I think about the museum, I have to think back to our lord and savior, the guy that they said made miracles, because they have made a miracle here on Earth. That's how deep this particular museum is. I don't think he left a stone unturned, I think that people are extremely emotional and excited about what they've seen in the museum.

This is also tied to an apology that's being put forward by the United States Olympic Committee for how they treated you and Dr. Smith, is that correct? I don't know whether they're attempting an apology as much as I think what they did is lowered the drawbridge and were willing to come across the drawbridge to greet us with open arms. I think they made it clear to me that they had a charter and they have rules and regulations that were instilled in the Olympic process, I guess at the beginning, and they feel that I crossed the line with my statement. However, they did express that we feel that what you did was the right movement and thought to say that you stand for justice and equality for all people. They admired the strength that we had to endure the pain and sacrifice we had [made] by making that statement. They acknowledged the fact that we haven't wavered from what our beliefs were at that particular time. And they reiterated that we agree with your statement, we just disagree with [you using] the podium for doing it. I can accept that. But relative to an apology, well, people always ask me, would you be happy with an apology from the USOC? I don't really feel that the USOC owes me an apology, but an apology is owed by an individual American by the name of Mr. Brent Musburger. Brent Musburger owes you an apology. Absolutely. I think I'm offended by the statements that Brent Musburger made, and I think every American, true American, should be offended by the statement that he made in reference to Dr. Smith and myself. You're talking about in 1968, as a young reporter for the Chicago American , Brent Musburger described you and Tommie Smith as \"black-skinned storm troopers.\" Absolutely. So what he's calling me is a neo-Nazi. So I guess, based on what we were fighting for at that particular time, if America accepted his statement towards us to call us neo-Nazis or fascists or whatever you might want to call it, then America is just acknowledging that maybe Kaepernick is right, maybe John Carlos is right, or all those civil activists down the line have been right. When a white individual can call a national figure in the Olympics games a black-skinned storm trooper and American society let it go? That's racism in itself. So if anyone owes an apology, it's Brent Musburger. And just to think about the fact that he made millions of dollars on the backs of so many young blacks that are out there playing every Saturday, and I would say that 99.9 percent of them have no idea that he called us black storm troopers. Do you think police violence and racism are actually getting worse now or do you think it's just a question of us being more aware? I think it's getting worse in the sense that, you know, we didn't have social media when I was a kid. What we did have, we had community policing. When I say community policing, I'm talking about, we had police that would beat police. They walked the streets, they knew the people in the community, the people in the community knew them. Some of them, we'd go to the people's houses to have lunch or dinner. They knew the kids in the community. If a kid did something and he was going the wrong way, they wouldn't throw him on the ground, face down, they wouldn't shackle him, drag him out, or shoot him or beat him up, they might take him home and let his parents deal with him and make him realize what you're doing is wrong. We no longer have a beat police. Used to be years ago, two riding in the car, now it's one riding in the car. They circle a whole area like they're herding cattle, to keep them in their stables, so to speak. So there's no relationship with them. If you look at something that's supposed to be less than you, that's less than you, whether it be sheep or cattle, and when it gets out. Well, what [do we do to the] sheep when it gets out and keeps getting out? They take the prod and put the prod on you, give you some shock treatment. Let them know that if you come through this gate, you're going to get lit up again. And that's the attitude that they have amongst certain police within these various agencies across the nation. I'm watching the cattle. If I have to take down one of the cattle because he stepped out of line, I'll do it. We have to make sure that the police department is responsible for their policing. We're not saying that the police, universally, is a bad situation. We're saying that you have bad elements within your agency and it's your responsibility, your job, you take the oath to protect the public. If you're not protecting the public because your own people are committing atrocities, then you have to take an inward look for yourself to deal with these atrocities that are happening from your agency. Simple as that. You know, that's all that young man is doing right now by taking a knee, saying, America has to take a better look at itself. If you remember back in 1968, when I was on the podium, I had a black shirt on to cover up my USA jersey. I didn't cover up my jersey because I was mad at United States. I covered my jersey because I was ashamed of the United States. There's a difference in being mad at someone and being ashamed of someone, and I was ashamed because all the projection that America had put out through the world, it was a farce, relative to where I was standing, and I felt that America could have done and should have done better. That's all these people are saying today. America, you can and you should do better.\n\nThere's a big difference, though, with this statue of Tommie Smith and you that stands at San Jose State, and that's Peter Norman. Peter Norman, the silver medalist from Australia, who, of course, stood with Tommie Smith and you and wore a button that said \"Olympic Project for Human Rights.\" He's not there at San Jose, but he is on the medal stand and part of the statue at the Smithsonian. Why is that? When the statue came about at the museum and I said, \"It's great that you guys are putting a statue up of Tommie and I, but it's imperative that you put Peter Norman up there as well. I said, because your job is to educate the masses through this museum and they would never be educated in the museum of African-American culture and history, it would never be true history if Peter Norman is not there. And then I had to remind him also that we don't want it to be a situation like John Brown. John Brown should have statues in and around the United States as well. We don't want him to be forgotten, as well as we don't want Peter Norman to be forgotten for his contributions to having an equal playing field for all races, particularly the black race. Is there a fear that when they make a statue out of you, that it's a way to sort of like make you safe, to extract your political teeth? No, not really, because that symbol is so revealing and so strong, for years after I'm dead and gone that symbol will still inspire and motivate individuals to seek out higher ground and to push the stone up the road, to making a better society for all people. Now, that's a eternal job. It's not a job that you say in 10 months, or 10 years or 25 years the job will be done. It's an eternal job. You're going to do this job as long as the bubble spins! You are also going to the White House this week. What is that about? That's incredible to think that I'm going to the White House, and once again I can say 48 years later from my involvement in the Olympics itself. I would hope that my teammates from the 1968 team, one day, will one day have their day at the White House as well, but at this particular time, Tommie Smith and I will be going to the White House as a part of the 2016 Olympic team that did so well. I take my hat off to all of the team, the women of the team in particular, for track and field, because the women came through big-time. So we have to respect and honor their good deeds. But, relative to going to the White House, man, it's a very emotional thing for me, in a sense that my father was in the First World War. Gave up blood, had relatives in the Second World War and the Korean War and none of them, I don't think, ever got close enough to the president of the nation that they stood for. For me to go, for my wife to be there by my side, I don't think it gets any greater than that. To be able to shake the president's hand, the first black president of the United States, that would be something that would linger through my mind.

And just to think about the fact that he made millions of dollars on the backs of so many young blacks that are out there playing every Saturday, and I would say that 99.9 percent of them have no idea that he called us black storm troopers. Do you think police violence and racism are actually getting worse now or do you think it's just a question of us being more aware? I think it's getting worse in the sense that, you know, we didn't have social media when I was a kid. What we did have, we had community policing. When I say community policing, I'm talking about, we had police that would beat police. They walked the streets, they knew the people in the community, the people in the community knew them. Some of them, we'd go to the people's houses to have lunch or dinner. They knew the kids in the community. If a kid did something and he was going the wrong way, they wouldn't throw him on the ground, face down, they wouldn't shackle him, drag him out, or shoot him or beat him up, they might take him home and let his parents deal with him and make him realize what you're doing is wrong. We no longer have a beat police. Used to be years ago, two riding in the car, now it's one riding in the car. They circle a whole area like they're herding cattle, to keep them in their stables, so to speak. So there's no relationship with them. If you look at something that's supposed to be less than you, that's less than you, whether it be sheep or cattle, and when it gets out. Well, what [do we do to the] sheep when it gets out and keeps getting out? They take the prod and put the prod on you, give you some shock treatment. Let them know that if you come through this gate, you're going to get lit up again. And that's the attitude that they have amongst certain police within these various agencies across the nation. I'm watching the cattle. If I have to take down one of the cattle because he stepped out of line, I'll do it. We have to make sure that the police department is responsible for their policing. We're not saying that the police, universally, is a bad situation. We're saying that you have bad elements within your agency and it's your responsibility, your job, you take the oath to protect the public. If you're not protecting the public because your own people are committing atrocities, then you have to take an inward look for yourself to deal with these atrocities that are happening from your agency. Simple as that. You know, that's all that young man is doing right now by taking a knee, saying, America has to take a better look at itself. If you remember back in 1968, when I was on the podium, I had a black shirt on to cover up my USA jersey. I didn't cover up my jersey because I was mad at United States. I covered my jersey because I was ashamed of the United States. There's a difference in being mad at someone and being ashamed of someone, and I was ashamed because all the projection that America had put out through the world, it was a farce, relative to where I was standing, and I felt that America could have done and should have done better. That's all these people are saying today. America, you can and you should do better.\n\nYou are also going to the White House this week. What is that about? That's incredible to think that I'm going to the White House, and once again I can say 48 years later from my involvement in the Olympics itself. I would hope that my teammates from the 1968 team, one day, will one day have their day at the White House as well, but at this particular time, Tommie Smith and I will be going to the White House as a part of the 2016 Olympic team that did so well. I take my hat off to all of the team, the women of the team in particular, for track and field, because the women came through big-time. So we have to respect and honor their good deeds. But, relative to going to the White House, man, it's a very emotional thing for me, in a sense that my father was in the First World War. Gave up blood, had relatives in the Second World War and the Korean War and none of them, I don't think, ever got close enough to the president of the nation that they stood for. For me to go, for my wife to be there by my side, I don't think it gets any greater than that. To be able to shake the president's hand, the first black president of the United States, that would be something that would linger through my mind. This is also tied to an apology that's being put forward by the United States Olympic Committee for how they treated you and Dr. Smith, is that correct? I don't know whether they're attempting an apology as much as I think what they did is lowered the drawbridge and were willing to come across the drawbridge to greet us with open arms. I think they made it clear to me that they had a charter and they have rules and regulations that were instilled in the Olympic process, I guess at the beginning, and they feel that I crossed the line with my statement. However, they did express that we feel that what you did was the right movement and thought to say that you stand for justice and equality for all people. They admired the strength that we had to endure the pain and sacrifice we had [made] by making that statement. They acknowledged the fact that we haven't wavered from what our beliefs were at that particular time. And they reiterated that we agree with your statement, we just disagree with [you using] the podium for doing it. I can accept that. But relative to an apology, well, people always ask me, would you be happy with an apology from the USOC? I don't really feel that the USOC owes me an apology, but an apology is owed by an individual American by the name of Mr. Brent Musburger. Brent Musburger owes you an apology. Absolutely. I think I'm offended by the statements that Brent Musburger made, and I think every American, true American, should be offended by the statement that he made in reference to Dr. Smith and myself. You're talking about in 1968, as a young reporter for the Chicago American , Brent Musburger described you and Tommie Smith as \"black-skinned storm troopers.\" Absolutely. So what he's calling me is a neo-Nazi. So I guess, based on what we were fighting for at that particular time, if America accepted his statement towards us to call us neo-Nazis or fascists or whatever you might want to call it, then America is just acknowledging that maybe Kaepernick is right, maybe John Carlos is right, or all those civil activists down the line have been right. When a white individual can call a national figure in the Olympics games a black-skinned storm trooper and American society let it go? That's racism in itself. So if anyone owes an apology, it's Brent Musburger. And just to think about the fact that he made millions of dollars on the backs of so many young blacks that are out there playing every Saturday, and I would say that 99.9 percent of them have no idea that he called us black storm troopers.

They acknowledged the fact that we haven't wavered from what our beliefs were at that particular time. And they reiterated that we agree with your statement, we just disagree with [you using] the podium for doing it. I can accept that. But relative to an apology, well, people always ask me, would you be happy with an apology from the USOC? I don't really feel that the USOC owes me an apology, but an apology is owed by an individual American by the name of Mr. Brent Musburger. Brent Musburger owes you an apology. Absolutely. I think I'm offended by the statements that Brent Musburger made, and I think every American, true American, should be offended by the statement that he made in reference to Dr. Smith and myself. You're talking about in 1968, as a young reporter for the Chicago American , Brent Musburger described you and Tommie Smith as \"black-skinned storm troopers.\" Absolutely. So what he's calling me is a neo-Nazi. So I guess, based on what we were fighting for at that particular time, if America accepted his statement towards us to call us neo-Nazis or fascists or whatever you might want to call it, then America is just acknowledging that maybe Kaepernick is right, maybe John Carlos is right, or all those civil activists down the line have been right. When a white individual can call a national figure in the Olympics games a black-skinned storm trooper and American society let it go? That's racism in itself. So if anyone owes an apology, it's Brent Musburger. And just to think about the fact that he made millions of dollars on the backs of so many young blacks that are out there playing every Saturday, and I would say that 99.9 percent of them have no idea that he called us black storm troopers. Do you think police violence and racism are actually getting worse now or do you think it's just a question of us being more aware? I think it's getting worse in the sense that, you know, we didn't have social media when I was a kid. What we did have, we had community policing. When I say community policing, I'm talking about, we had police that would beat police. They walked the streets, they knew the people in the community, the people in the community knew them. Some of them, we'd go to the people's houses to have lunch or dinner. They knew the kids in the community. If a kid did something and he was going the wrong way, they wouldn't throw him on the ground, face down, they wouldn't shackle him, drag him out, or shoot him or beat him up, they might take him home and let his parents deal with him and make him realize what you're doing is wrong. We no longer have a beat police. Used to be years ago, two riding in the car, now it's one riding in the car. They circle a whole area like they're herding cattle, to keep them in their stables, so to speak. So there's no relationship with them. If you look at something that's supposed to be less than you, that's less than you, whether it be sheep or cattle, and when it gets out. Well, what [do we do to the] sheep when it gets out and keeps getting out? They take the prod and put the prod on you, give you some shock treatment. Let them know that if you come through this gate, you're going to get lit up again. And that's the attitude that they have amongst certain police within these various agencies across the nation. I'm watching the cattle. If I have to take down one of the cattle because he stepped out of line, I'll do it. We have to make sure that the police department is responsible for their policing. We're not saying that the police, universally, is a bad situation. We're saying that you have bad elements within your agency and it's your responsibility, your job, you take the oath to protect the public. If you're not protecting the public because your own people are committing atrocities, then you have to take an inward look for yourself to deal with these atrocities that are happening from your agency. Simple as that. You know, that's all that young man is doing right now by taking a knee, saying, America has to take a better look at itself. If you remember back in 1968, when I was on the podium, I had a black shirt on to cover up my USA jersey. I didn't cover up my jersey because I was mad at United States. I covered my jersey because I was ashamed of the United States. There's a difference in being mad at someone and being ashamed of someone, and I was ashamed because all the projection that America had put out through the world, it was a farce, relative to where I was standing, and I felt that America could have done and should have done better. That's all these people are saying today. America, you can and you should do better.\n\nBut relative to an apology, well, people always ask me, would you be happy with an apology from the USOC?

They circle a whole area like they're herding cattle, to keep them in their stables, so to speak. So there's no relationship with them. If you look at something that's supposed to be less than you, that's less than you, whether it be sheep or cattle, and when it gets out. Well, what [do we do to the] sheep when it gets out and keeps getting out? They take the prod and put the prod on you, give you some shock treatment. Let them know that if you come through this gate, you're going to get lit up again. And that's the attitude that they have amongst certain police within these various agencies across the nation.

Simple as that. You know, that's all that young man is doing right now by taking a knee, saying, America has to take a better look at itself.

      "text": "The Fires That Forged Iceberg Slim\n\nI'm always amazed when I encounter well-read people unfamiliar with Iceberg Slim. The notion that his books circulate only in the urban ghetto's literary underground is laughable. Iceberg Slim, whose legal name was Robert Beck, burst on to the scene nearly half a century ago, with his memoir \"Pimp: The Story of My Life\" (1967), followed immediately by the novel \"Trick Baby\" (1967), which was adapted for the screen by Universal Pictures. During the nineteen-seventies, Beck published three more novels and a collection of political essays, recorded a spoken-word LP, was profiled in magazines and newspapers, and became a bona-fide L.A. celebrity. He launched a new form of crime fiction, with the late Donald Goines becoming his best-known protégé. Before his death in 1992, Beck had become an inspiration and éminence grise for gangsta rap. Sociologists, anthropologists, and linguists of the ghetto had granted \"Pimp\" a certain ethnographic authority when it first appeared; after hip-hop became a subject of academic study, Beck's work returned to the ivory tower, appearing in cultural-studies courses and literary journals (and in Peter Muckley's 2003 book, \"Iceberg Slim: The Life as Art\"). In 2012, Ice T and Jorge Hinojosa produced the entertaining and revealing documentary \"Iceberg Slim: Portrait of a Pimp,\" which both celebrated and humanized its subject. As I write this, \"Pimp\" is the number-one best-seller on Amazon in the category \" Philosophy of Good & Evil ,\" beating out \"The End of Faith,\" by the less colorful writer Sam Harris.\n\nThe new book \"Street Poison: The Biography of Iceberg Slim,\" by Justin Gifford, is an exercise in demystification. We learn that Beck's oft-quoted claim of having an I.Q. of 175 was false, and that \"Iceberg\" was just a nom de plume _ _that Beck invented while writing \"Pimp\" (his actual street name was Cavanaugh Slim). Having conned, cajoled, and terrorized his way through the underworld, Beck ironically proved to be a perfect mark for Holloway House, his longtime publisher, whose miniscule royalty checks never matched their extraordinary sales figures. The great story in \"Street Poison\" is not about the making of a pimp but about the making of a writer and self-styled political prophet. Robert Moppins, Jr., was born in Chicago to Mary Brown and Robert Moppins in 1918, reborn as Cavanaugh Slim in the streets of Milwaukee in the nineteen-thirties, and reborn again, as Robert Beck, in Los Angeles in 1963, when he chose to honor his mother by taking her late husband's last name. But Iceberg Slim was born circa 1965, following the assassination of Malcolm X and the uprising in Watts. Refashioning himself as an old ex-crook turned revolutionary, he wrote \"Pimp\" as an act of redemption. \"Perhaps my remorse for my ghastly life,\" he declared in the preface, \"will diminish to the degree that within this one book I have been allowed to purge myself. Perhaps one day I can win respect as a constructive human being.\" While poverty is what inspired Beck and his common-law wife, Betty, to transmute his dark memories into a book, \"Pimp\" was also meant to be a contribution to the black revolution. Instead, it catapulted the pimp into American popular culture's pantheon of celluloid heroes and outlaws.\n\nTo be fair, \"Pimp\" is not responsible for glamorizing pimps. The figure of the pimp has been revered and reviled in African-American culture for more than a century, often through tales, \"toasts\" (bawdy oral poetry), and song. What Beck did was take the cartoon image of the pimp projected in urban rhymes and strutting street characters and give him flesh, history, and dimension, exposing the dehumanizing brutality of \"the game.\" And he did so when ghettoes were in revolt and black Americans had become an object of worldwide fascination.\n\nIf Beck set out to cast a critical light on pimping, why did young cats turn to his books for advice_ _on how to be better pimps? How could an author whose sales figures topped two million in just a few years have been so radically misunderstood? And why haven't his other books, especially his political essays, received nearly as much attention as his début? Gifford doesn't answer these questions, but his revelations about Beck's political life and personal demons offer some clues. His book helps one to see why Beck could probably never kill the pimp without killing a part of himself, and why, when the fires of rebellion began to peter out, voyeurism and titillation prevailed.\n\nWhen Beck first decided to write his story, he was working as an exterminator and living in South Los Angeles with a young white woman named Betty Mae Shue, her toddler son, and their newborn daughter. It was Betty who proposed committing Beck's stories to paper, Betty who found the publisher, and Betty who transcribed and typed Beck's manuscripts. And it was around this time that the Watts rebellion, in August of 1965, shook Beck to his core. His initial fears for his family's safety gave way to an appreciation for the new mood in the community. Former gang members joined political organizations like the Sons of Watts and, later, the Black Panther Party. Local youth turned a damaged furniture store into the Watts Happening Coffee House, a hangout for would-be militants, artists, and intellectuals. The radical Jewish screenwriter Budd Schulberg launched the Watts Writers Workshop, which Beck would eventually come to support. Amid a veritable cultural revolution, \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" appeared in print, just months after Malcolm's murder. Beck said that he modelled his own memoir on \"The Autobiography,\" telling one interviewer, years later, \"Malcolm X defined the atrocity that pimpin' is.\"\n\nBeck may also have identified with Malcolm because both men had unresolved conflicts with their mothers. (Malcolm's mother was institutionalized when he was thirteen.) Beck traced his personal trajectory to two traumatic events: being sexually abused by a babysitter, and being ripped away from a loving, stable stepfather. Both of these things happened, as he saw it, because of choices that his mother made. This produced within Beck an intense hatred of her, which led to a hatred of all women. According to a prison psychiatrist, that hatred drove Beck to pimping. Dogged by recurring nightmares of whipping his mother as if she were a slave, Beck spent much of his time in Leavenworth penitentiary, where he was imprisoned in the mid-nineteen-forties, reading Freud, Jung, and Karl Menninger. Rather than overcoming his feelings, however, he used his new knowledge, after his release, to better subjugate his prostitutes. Then, in 1962, sitting in Chicago's notorious Cook County jail, on the verge of madness, he realized that freedom from pimping required reconciling with his mother. Upon his release, he raced to Los Angeles so they could spend the rest of her days together.\n\nThe potentially radical implications of Beck's epiphany were blunted, though, by the era's new, militant masculinity, which was fuelled by direct confrontations with state violence and reinforced by Daniel Patrick Moynihan's \"The Negro Family: A Case for National Action,\" published, like Malcolm's autobiography, in 1965. The controversial report blamed black women-or, rather, an entrenched matriarchal culture-for sexual promiscuity, street crime, and the poverty that plagued black communities. Even close readers of \"Pimp,\" such as the comedian and actor Chris Rock, glibly attribute Beck's downward spiral to Beck's mother. But Beck does no such thing; instead, he blames himself for harboring misplaced hatred, and concedes that his road to redemption was paved by his mother's unconditional love.\n\nPerhaps it is no accident that \"Pimp,\" Beck's most popular work, is also his least political. \"Trick Baby,\", which centers on a biracial pimp whose light skin allows him to move through both black ghettoes and white high society, is an adroit exposé of race and class in America. The protagonist, known to his friends as \"White Folks,\" attends a dinner party where he witnesses a racist police chief and a liberal capitalist propose solutions to the \"nigra problem.\" The cop aims to use state violence and incarceration to crush black civil-rights protests, while the capitalist's \"master plan\" is to drive a wedge between educated black élites and the working-class.\n\nBy the end of the nineteen-sixties, Beck had developed a reputation as a public intellectual, even as he continued to struggle financially. A popular lecturer, he spoke on topics ranging from the sex trade to the history of the Puritans, sounding more like a young black militant than an aging ex-pimp. In a lecture at Chicago's Malcolm X College, Beck told the students: \"when you exploit your own kind ... you are, in effect, a counterrevolutionary.\" Not surprisingly, Beck praised the Black Panthers, in spite of the contempt local members showed him. In his eyes, they were \"the authentic champions and heroes of the black race ... categorically superior to that older generation of physical cowards of which I am a part.\"\n\nBeck described meeting the Black Panthers in his most enigmatic and overlooked book, \"The Naked Soul of Iceberg Slim\" (1971). Subtitled \"The Real Robert Beck,\" this slender collection of essays was his manifesto. Inspired by James Baldwin's \"The Fire Next Time\" (1964) but bearing a closer resemblance to Julius Lester's \"Revolutionary Notes\" (1969), the essays were not meant as a repudiation of \"Pimp.\" Rather, they could be read as a kind of Hegelian synthesis produced from the unity of opposites: Cavanaugh Slim (thesis) and Robert Beck (antithesis). Hence his dedication of the book to Malcolm X, Angela Davis, Huey Newton, and George Jackson, as well as \"all the street niggers and strugglers in and out of the joints.\" The essays cover a range of topics, from a psychosexual history of lynching and the black bourgeoisie to police violence and pimping. Mixing personal reflections and political commentary, the essays argue that white supremacy and class rule in America are fragile. \"A police state created ostensibly for the stomping down of the niggers and the New Left would soon become a horror state for all the people,\" he muses in one particularly prescient passage. Revolution, in Beck's view, was not only necessary but inevitable. He wrote, \"America is being led to her death by racist power junkies coasting on a stupid trip-the fatal fantasy that soldiers and police can destroy with clubs and guns an indestructible force: the hunger of the human soul for dignity, justice, and freedom.\"\n\nBeck began to soften his stance on pimps and sex workers, and his critique of the black élite hardened. He complained about black columnists who \"flay black pimps and whores as criminals, while fiends in blue blood let in the black ghetto unseen and uncondemned.\" In Socratic style, he and an old hustler friend excoriate the black élite and respectability politics. Beck wonders if they are \"so poisoned with bias and bigotry for other types of black people that their public images are a fraud and their lives a lie? Can any black man really be a leader, a humanitarian and champion of black advancement who tries only to understand and help the progress of those blacks who he probably believes will become social mock-ups of himself?\"\n\nBeck's defense of \"other types of black people\" is perhaps best represented in what is arguably his finest novel, \"Mama Black Widow\" (1969), a sympathetic portrait of the trials and tribulations of Otis Tilson, a black drag queen whose family moves from the Deep South to Chicago in search of opportunity. Instead, they get misery, violence, and unremitting poverty. Otis is harassed by the police, beaten by other black men, and repeatedly raped, but he finds community and a modicum of protection in Bronzeville's gay community: \"There was somehow a sweet and wonderful atmosphere of equality and brotherhood among queers. I guess they were so despised and discriminated against in the straight world that in mutual anguish and suffering they found emotional sanctuary among themselves.\"\n\nBy 1971, Beck was reportedly one of the best-selling black authors in the country, but, according to the Gifford biography, he earned little income thanks to Holloway House's creative accounting methods. His brood had ballooned to three daughters and a son, and he needed revenue. His fortunes changed the following year, when Universal Pictures bought the rights to \"Trick Baby\" for twenty-five thousand dollars. Although the movie was, by most accounts, a creative disaster, it enabled the family to abandon South Los Angeles for the Hollywood Hills, and it provided enough stability for Beck to turn his attention to writing screenplays. He also began to enjoy a kind of fame that would gradually lure him away from his family, toward a Hollywood lifestyle that occasionally resembled the pimp world he had left behind. Betty, tired of his absences, his philandering, and his lack of productivity, took the kids and left.\n\nRumors notwithstanding, Beck never slipped back into \"the Life,\" but his interviews in the nineteen-seventies reveal a creeping nostalgia for pimping, especially after blaxploitation cinema took off. He began to play the hustler, dispensing pimp wisdom and deftly cashing in on his aura. His publicity photos from the time evoke the old Iceberg Slim, sprawled on his bed or lounging on an overstuffed couch, sporting an ascot or a wild suit, posing in front of his Lincoln, hair pressed and curled. In a 1973 profile in Women's Wear Daily , he reminisces about how in \"the golden days of pimping, it was an art\" that required \"cunning, agility and speed.\" And yet, in the same interview, he praises black women for their strength and perseverance in the face of unrelenting abuse.\n\nPerhaps this is the Iceberg Slim synthesis. Pimps are not only capable of redemption, they exhibit a power and masculinity that militants lack. Their open defiance of the \"restrictions of morality and the conventional ways of society,\" he told one reporter, render pimps \"unoppressed heroes, in a limited context, who stand with their (psychological) balls intact.\" Beck's 1977 novel \"Death Wish,\" about the Mafia in Chicago, even suggests ways to channel gangsta masculinity toward socially productive ends. In a subplot resembling Sam Greenlee's 1969 novel, \"The Spook Who Sat By the Door,\" a couple of anti-Mafia gangsters organize an underground paramilitary unit to rob dope dealers and numbers runners in order to finance a drug-rehabilitation center.\n\nBeck understood that writing was a form of entertainment and a hustle as well as a political act. Even as he flirted with the Panthers and swapped his nightmares for revolutionary dreams, he knew that his greatest commodity was his street cred-and he pimped it, even as he disavowed it. This ambivalence kept him from leaping headlong into the movement, but it also mirrored the urban proletariat's love-hate relationship with a laissez-faire capitalism that rewards and celebrates those who obtain wealth by any means necessary. It can be hard to listen to lectures from characters who flash bulging money clips and diamond-studded teeth.\n\nStill, Iceberg Slim was forged in the fires of Watts, just as the sharpest lyrical critiques from his gangsta-rap descendants Ice-T and Ice Cube were shaped by the L.A. Rebellion of 1992 and by the slow burn of deindustrialization and the drug wars that preceded it. The new film \" Straight Outta Compton \" is a reminder of how N.W.A.'s raw stories of crime, violence, and policing resonated with their times. But what the film elides is how the pimp, in all of his unreconstructed brutality, made a comeback in the era of \"reality rap.\" N.W.A.'s final album, \"Niggaz4Life,\" made without Ice Cube, included such tracks as \"Findum, Fuckum & Flee\" and \"One Less Bitch,\" in which Dr. Dre assumes the role of a pimp who murders his prostitute for holding back a few dollars. Released a couple of months after the L.A.P.D. beat Rodney King and a store proprietor in South Los Angeles fatally shot the fifteen-year-old Latasha Harlins over a bottle of orange juice, \"Niggaz4Life_\"__ _shot to the top of the charts, selling more than two million copies in the U.S. alone. A year later, L.A. blew up.\n\nPerhaps the old adage that \"pimps never die, they multiply\" is true, but only as long as violence thrills, patriarchy prevails, women are economically vulnerable, and misogyny continues to shore up a fragile masculinity. Or, as Beck might put it, the pimp's fate depends on the fire next time.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "A Black British Artist Asks, \"What Was Africa to the Harlem Renaissance?\"\n\nAlain Locke is remembered as a leader of the Harlem Renaissance largely for assembling \" The New Negro ,\" a 1925 anthology that immortalized a small group of young writers-Langston Hughes, Claude McKay, Zora Neale Hurston, Jessie Fauset, and others-as America's first Black literary movement. But, if things had gone differently, he might have left an even deeper mark in the visual arts. Among his greatest unrealized ambitions was to establish a Harlem Museum of African Art, where the next generation of sculptors, painters, photographers, and printmakers could draw inspiration from the continent as they enacted their own transformation of Black American identity. \"We must believe that there still slumbers in the blood something which once stirred will react with peculiar emotional intensity toward it,\" he wrote in a special issue of Opportunity devoted to African sculpture. \"Nothing is more galvanizing than the sense of a cultural past.\"\n\nGrasping this legacy was anything but simple, as Countee Cullen suggested in his poem \"Heritage.\" Republished in Locke's anthology alongside photographs of Dogon and Guro statuary, it asked whether a Black American \"three centuries removed / From the scenes his fathers loved\" could even relate to them beyond an empty longing for jumbled exotica: \"Spicy grove and banyan tree, / What is Africa to me?\" The art works, too, were victims of alienation. Ripped from African societies by colonizing armies, they'd become cheap curios in European markets-and then, reduced to bare form, aesthetic kindling for a burgeoning modernist movement. The sculptures that accompanied Cullen's poem were from the Barnes Foundation in Merion, Pennsylvania, where \"primitive\" statuary was exhibited alongside works by Picasso, Modigliani, and other avant-garde devotees of l'art nègre . Salvaging a New Negro from this distorted chain of transmission would require much more than race pride and nostalgia. To claim African sculpture as their heritage, Black artists of the era had to devise new ways to look.\n\nLocke's fraught encounter with what he called the \"ancestral arts\" is the subject of \"Once Again . . . (Statues Never Die),\" Isaac Julien's new video installation at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia. (It controversially relocated from Merion a decade ago.) Set around 1924, on the eve of the Harlem Renaissance, it's a mesmerizing portrait of the philosopher, critic, and queer cultural visionary as a roving eye, determined to liberate the Black imagination through the alchemy of art. A five-channel black-and-white film follows Locke (played by André Holland, of \"Moonlight\") through a series of vignettes that dramatize the complex entanglement of aesthetics and racecraft. At Oxford, where Locke faced prejudice as the first Black Rhodes Scholar, imposing marble statues of Aristotle and Leibniz loom like demigods; nearby, their African counterparts serve as primitive specimens in the university's anthropology museum. It's a stark demonstration of art's power to naturalize racial domination-or, in a later scene, upend its terms. When Locke visits the sculptor Richmond Barthé (Devon Terrell), his protégé and occasional lover, the two gaze admiringly at a young model's virile contours: the New Negro as a Black male Galatea, poised to step out of the workshop and transform American life. A haunting performance by the singer Alice Smith, which recurs throughout the film, underlines the pain and promise of cultural rebirth: \"Once again, I begin . . .\"\n\nLocke proves an ideal subject for Julien, a recently knighted British artist and filmmaker whom the scholar Rinaldo Walcott has described as \"the crown prince of Black queer cinema.\" He's known for his prismatic depictions of historical figures, often in elaborate multiscreen installations that mix archival video and dramatic reënactment. Many of his subjects are Black men-including Matthew Henson, Derek Walcott, and Frantz Fanon-and the aesthetics of Black masculinity are a preoccupation. \"Lessons of the Hour\" (2019), a ten-screen installation, explored Frederick Douglass's transformative use of photography in the abolition struggle, a theme continuous with the new project's consideration of race and modernist sculpture. Even closer is Julien's breakout film, \"Looking for Langston\" (1989), an homage to the gay writers and artists of the Harlem Renaissance that drew parallels with the Black Gay Renaissance of the nineteen-eighties. \"Statues Never Die\" borrows a few scenes, songs, and an underground speakeasy from the earlier film, echoing its vision of a Blackness untrammelled by chronology. In his final scene, Locke, dusted in mysteriously ascending snowflakes, closes his eyes and quotes the late bell hooks, invoking a \"mythical diasporic dream space\" where \"a culture of infinite possibility is ready to receive us.\"\n\nJulien's installation is a dream space all its own. Playing on five double-sided screens in a darkened gallery with mirrored walls, the thirty-minute film is visible no matter where you look. Reflections interpolate visitors into the play of gazes; watching others, and being watched, in encounters with art, one becomes intimately aware of how aesthetic categories creep into the assessment of other human beings. Finally, a group of sculptures exhibited on either side of the room evokes Locke's unrealized museum: African masks and statues from the Barnes collection; Richmond Barthé's neoclassically inflected Black figures in bronze; and five striking works by the contemporary artist Matthew Angelo Harrison, who entombs cheap African statues made for the tourist trade in transparent blocks of polyurethane. He then carves patterns into the resin with computerized machining tools-a visceral evocation of colonial violence and the alienation that Cullen described in \"Heritage.\" It looks as if someone has tried, and failed, to prise out the statue within.\n\nThe project's animating tension derives from the collision of Locke's dream with the realities of power. African sculpture was scarcely accessible to Black Americans of the early twentieth century, except through white collectors who often had agendas of their own. Accordingly, the film's anchoring sequence is a dialogue between Locke and Albert C. Barnes, the founder of the collection, a pharmaceutical millionaire who helped introduce both African sculpture and European modernism to the United States. Shot in the very building where Julien's exhibition is installed, it finds the two men surrounded by Barnes's eclectic art hoard-his precise arrangements of the works frozen in place by a provision of his will. \"It will be the glory of a few men endowed with certain prophetic visions to have inscribed in the history of the beginning of the twentieth century the revelation of the primitive statues of the African Black race,\" Barnes declares.\n\nThe Barnes, which commissioned the exhibition to celebrate its centennial, is pleased to frame it as a celebration of a pioneering interracial partnership. Yet Julien's film slyly emphasizes the tensions between the two ambitious Philadelphians, particularly the difficulty, for Locke, of being instructed on his heritage by a notoriously self-regarding millionaire. (In a rare moment of comedy, Barnes, wearing sunglasses indoors, admires a portrait of himself by Giorgio de Chirico.) Deflecting Barnes's assertions with consummate politeness, he lays out his own theory in more solitary scenes. African sculpture, Locke warns, has survived \"a period of neglect and disesteem\" only to end up \"in danger of another sort of misconstruction, that of being taken up as an exotic fad and a fashionable amateurish interest.\"\n\nThe dissonance offers a glimpse of a rivalrous relationship. According to Jeffrey C. Stewart's Pulitzer-winning biography , Locke's critical engagement with African sculpture essentially began with a visit to Barnes's collection in 1924. Yet he quickly ran afoul of the white philanthropist's territorial determination to become the Negrophile of Negrophiles. Barnes aspired to make the foundation a pilgrimage center for young Black artists, who would need to earn his favor if they wanted to master a tradition that \"had long been dead in Africa\" (as a monograph that his foundation commissioned erroneously claimed). When Locke repurposed insights gleaned from their conversations in his articles-a Promethean act of theft, in Stewart's telling-Barnes was furious. Beyond the pettiness was a divide over whether \"primitive\" art was a blood transfusion for Western culture or the New Negro's transformative inheritance.\n\nNeither man wrote much about those from whom the art works were taken-an omission that Julien addresses in one of the film's most extraordinary sequences. It begins with an overhead shot of the main exhibition hall at the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, where anthropological artifacts from across the British Empire were warehoused. Locke, immaculately dressed, wanders among the crowded vitrines, crushing fallen leaves beneath his patent-leather shoes. The image recalls an elegy by the French Guyanese poet Léon-Gontran Damas, which a woman reads aloud at the start of the film: \"How many of me me me have died since they came that night when the tam-tams rolled . . .the frenzy of eyes, the frenzy of hands, the frenzy of statues feet.\" Locke says nothing, but leaves suppressing tears.\n\nThe woman's voice, though, does return, as a mysterious curator joins Locke in the museum's labyrinth. She weaves excerpts from Aimé Césaire, Wole Soyinka, and others in a plaintive monologue expressing the incalculable losses colonialism inflicted on African peoples. (Sharlene Whyte, whom Julien cast as Frederick Douglass's wife Anna Murray Douglass in \"Lessons of the Hour,\" brings a restrained gravity to the role.) Later, she reads from the diary of a British officer present at the 1897 sack of Benin City: \"Juju houses to be blown up. Walls and houses to be knocked down. Queen mother's house to be burnt.\" Behind the screens, a sixteenth-century statue looted from the city watches over the exhibition; it belongs to the Barnes Foundation. Here, as with his depiction of Barnes, Julien succeeds in creating a site-specific work of institutional critique unadulterated by the coöperating institution-a rare feat at a time when so many museums are shrewdly marketing the spectacle of reform. He describes the work as an act of \"poetic restitution.\"\n\n\"In the museum, the rapture of self-gratification rots our eyes, a secret contempt of others dries up our hearts,\" Whyte continues, quoting Aimé Césaire, as a Benin frieze scrolls by; on another screen, a gloved hand turns the pages of a photo album. She delivers a verdict: \"No, in the scales of knowledge, the mass of all the museums in the world could never outweigh a lone spark of human empathy.\" The collaged texts are paired with scenes from two classic films about plunder and repatriation: Nii Kwate Owoo's \"You Hide Me\" (1970), which follows two young Africans into the storerooms of the British Museum, and Chris Marker's \"Statues Also Die\" (1953), its title inverted in Julien's. One strange fruit of colonial theft, Julien reminds us, was diasporic collaboration. But the weight of history, and the growing prominence of debates over restitution , throws a different light on Locke's resurrection of African sculpture. What does it mean, we might ask, to fashion a New Negro from a kinsman's scattered limbs?\n\nJulien's installation leaves open the possibility that Locke's Africanism was a failure. He knew, and could know, very little about the sculptures he so admired-which, at the time, were frequently attributed to the wrong ethnic groups and eras. Nearly a century after he challenged Barnes, the millionaire's institution endures, while Locke's efforts to build his own led to embarrassment. Once, at the behest of Charlotte Osgood Mason-an even more zealously primitivist patron of the Renaissance-Locke reluctantly asked Paul Robeson to give a benefit concert for the museum while wearing an African mask. The great singer politely refused.\n\nIn the nineteen-thirties, many took a dim view of Locke's Africanism, which was decried as a concession to segregation. Black artists of the next generation, such as Romare Bearden, revolted against the \"coddling and patronizing\" white benefactors the older man had worked with; by contrast, the New Deal created more neutral sources of funding for Black artists through programs such as the W.P.A. The critiques reached their zenith in the seventies, when historians like David Levering Lewis recast Locke's endeavors, and the Harlem Renaissance, as an élite diversion of radical energy into the impotent world of high culture. Such arguments still have purchase, especially in an era when the prestige of Black art has again so far outpaced material progress for Black Americans as to cast doubt on any significant relationship between them.\n\nBut the art historian Kobena Mercer argues that Locke's culturalism has been misconstrued. In a new book, \" Alain Locke and the Visual Arts \"-felicitously coincident with Julien's installation-he convincingly challenges the \"received image\" of his subject as an \"effete Afro-Edwardian aesthete\" with no firm concept of the relationship between art, politics, and empire. Locke may have been a snob, but he was also, in Mercer's account, a pragmatist, who believed that Black political solidarity needed a renewed cultural foundation; an anti-imperialist, sensitive to the ways that colonialism had transformed native art into creative capital; and a pluralist, whose interest in African sculpture was less a backward-looking reclamation of roots than a reckoning with loss prerequisite to cross-cultural renewal.\n\nAlthough Locke's museum was never built, he did make a significant body of African sculpture accessible to Black American artists. In 1926, he persuaded a friend to purchase a few dozen Congolese art works from a Belgian diplomat, and these pieces later toured historically Black colleges throughout the United States. Now held by the Schomburg Center in Harlem, the collection likely influenced Romare Bearden, who incorporated the blue patterning of one distinctive Kuba mask from the collection into his painting \"The Family.\" (The post-Harlem generation may have rejected aspects of Locke's Africanism, Mercer explains, but they had already digested its insights.) Another influential legacy was \" The Negro in Art \" (1940), a picture book whose juxtaposition of African, European, and American traditions was ahead of its time in its proto-multiculturalism and rejection of \"evolutionist\" chronology. The freedom of print reproduction, Mercer explains, allowed Locke to build what André Malraux called a musée imaginaire , showcasing the many ways in which \"elements that survived a catastrophic past may undergo metamorphosis and be granted an afterlife.\"\n\nArtists of the era shared Locke's emphasis on death and resurrection. Reflecting on works by Palmer Hayden, Malvin Gray Johnson, Lois Mailou Jones, and others, Mercer demonstrates that mourning was central to Harlem Renaissance Africanism. Masks that often appeared in still-lifes from the era, he writes, can be seen as analogous to the skulls in the Western tradition of vanitas or memento mori . In a striking interpretation of Jones's celebrated painting \"Les Fétiches\" (1938), which depicts an ensemble of African statuary swirling in a charged darkness, he writes that the work embodies not a straightforward reclamation of roots but the tragedy and the promise of diaspora. \"Jones's masks are double-facing,\" he writes, \"for they are abyss-crossing icons of black survival, open to new constellations in a galaxy of multiple possibilities for the future of black life.\"\n\nPerhaps the most fascinating argument that Mercer advances concerns sexuality. Locke came of age amid a Victorian wave of gay aestheticism that looked to classical art as inspiration for a new homosexual identity. Photographers such as Fred Holland Day and Wilhelm von Gloeden staged homoerotic scenes from antiquity with contemporary models, while writers such as John Addington Symonds-who, in an 1878 translation, brought out of the closet Michelangelo's sonnets to his young lover-began to reconstruct the literary history of gay love. Nearly as popular as Greek motifs were Black male models, whose appeal, Mercer says, derived in part from the association of racial difference with sexual transgression. This Victorian alignment of the Black male body with classical homoeroticism set the stage for the Harlem Renaissance, when Black artists and a few white fellow-travellers mobilized it for their own ends. In art works such as Richmond Barthé's sculpture of Féral Benga, a Senegalese dancer, swaying gently with a sword; Carl van Vechten's private photo-portraits of naked models posing with African statuary; or Richard Bruce Nugent's sensuous silhouette illustrations for Fire!! , the Black male body became a vector of the future-or, as Mercer puts it in the title of his final chapter, \"Homo Negro, Endlessly New.\"\n\nThe phrase captures a symmetry between queer self-fashioning and the African American search for heritage. Neither Victorian gays nor New Negroes could simply inherit their identities; instead, each group had to invent its ancestors, piecing them together from discontinuous pasts. Although Locke is often called the godfather of the Harlem Renaissance, Mercer notes that he liked to describe himself as its midwife, a label that he borrowed from Socrates. If fatherhood implies one all-determining lineage, queer midwifery suggests a more collaborative approach to cultural identity-a chosen family of ancestors and ancestral arts. It's an ethos that lives on in the work of artists like Isaac Julien, a longtime friend and collaborator of Mercer's and someone whose cinematic constellations he cites as an influence on his approach. How appropriate, then, that \"Statues Never Die\" moves from the graveyard of the anthropology museum to the erotics of the workshop, where the act of looking together at the past allows something new to begin. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Pour One Out for Tyler Perry's Madea\n\nCreators, with their special hubris, are at constant risk of being swallowed by the act of creation; they give their inventions fabulous power and, in the process, lose control of them. Has any contemporary commercial artist learned this lesson quite like Tyler Perry? His most famous character, the brusque grandmother Madea, packs an assault rifle and a Glock. She pulls the pistol out of her purse as effortlessly as sane old ladies produce those awful strawberry bonbons. In nearly a dozen stage plays, and in as many movies, Madea has taken aim at no-good freeloaders and goody-goody authorities, all while spreading a hard-headed traditionalism herself. But no one has stared down the barrel of her cultural menace more often than Perry himself. Since 1999, when he first débuted Madea, in the theatre piece \"I Can Do Bad All By Myself,\" Perry has played his own matriarch, wearing a gray press-and-curl wig and a muumuu and covering his six-foot-five frame with a stuffed suit. Perry is Madea, but, in a sense, it's Madea who owns Perry.\n\nHe's thought about killing her for at least a decade. For one thing, the suit is heavy and the makeup is smothering. Now he's about to turn fifty, and has a child and a girlfriend offscreen; he will probably one day be Hollywood's first black male billionaire. As a dramatic actor, in thrillers like \"Alex Cross,\" and \"Gone Girl,\" Perry is capable of barrel-chested valor (though it would have been nearly impossible for anyone to summon gravitas as Colin Powell in Adam McKay's \"Vice,\" given the hollow script, and the fact that Perry's chin quiver calls to mind Madea's neck roll did him no extra favors).\n\nPerry did nearly \"off\" Madea once,  in \"Boo 2! A Madea Halloween,\" a couple of years ago, but, like a zombie or like Jesus, whom she so merrily misquotes, she rose again. \"It's time for me to kill that old bitch,\" Perry told the radio host Bevy Smith, last fall. \"A Madea Family Funeral,\" which was released earlier this month, is, according to Perry, the last Madea movie. Even so, he couldn't bring himself to fully destroy his creation. On the movie's poster, she lounges on a coffin that belongs to someone else, praise hands up.\n\nThe torment of Perry's mommy drag is charmingly Freudian. In his Madea films, Perry also plays a lawyerly version of himself, named Brian, a nephew of Madea's who, with terrorized obedience, chauffeurs her around town after a judge suspends her license. Perry has explained that he based Madea, in part, on his own aunts and his beloved mother, who raised her son with a moral stringency that countered the moral deficiency of his father, who was abusive. (After his mother's death, Perry learned that she had lied to him, and that his biological father was someone else.) Set the autobiographical inspiration aside, though, and you'll notice that Madea bears little resemblance to older black women in the real world. She smokes weed, curses, and spits. She self-identifies as a thug. She could steal your man and your wallet. Her religiosity is unorthodox-she interprets the Bible's \"Peace, be still,\" to refer to the \"piece o' steel\" she keeps in her purse. Her Southern accent-\"Hallelujer!\" \"Praise da Lort!\" \"Hellur!\"-is not one found in nature.\n\nMabel (Madea) Simmons is a laugh-track mommie dearest, a vulgar mammy whose charges aren't wet white babies but wayward black young adults. She hails from a dubious performance tradition that started in minstrel theatres, in the nineteenth century, and, since the nineteen-eighties, has been floridly revived by black male comedians doing intra-racial pseudo-drag. The difference between Perry's Madea and Martin Lawrence's Big Momma or Eddie Murphy's Anna Klump is that Madea plays the role of the pragmatic moralist in Perry's cosmos; the Madea movies are mouthy morality plays for the entertainment of black women. Perry's secondary female characters are either professionally and romantically insecure, falling for dark-skinned mogul-tyrants, as in \"Diary of a Mad Black Woman,\" or they're too stubborn to submit to hard-working, light-skinned brothers, as in \"Madea's Family Reunion.\" Madea presides over the domestic turmoil of her various nieces, neighbors, and foster daughters, pinching their ears and swatting their behinds until all the family trauma is exorcised and replaced with strong-willed common sense. Cicely Tyson or Maya Angelou might even make a cameo, to firm up the feeling of ancestral dignity.\n\nPerry's movies and television shows are formulaic and clichéd, yet they have achieved enormous success. White critics don't like them, but their reviews are polite pans, not referendums on Perry's soul. (As Hilton Als wrote, in a New Yorker piece on Perry in 2010 , \"No white critic wants to tell a black man what he can or cannot say about his own society.\") For black critics, more is at stake. For years, the reaction was uniform hostility toward Perry's embrace of melodrama and stereotype. In 2009, Spike Lee called Perry's sitcoms \"Meet the Browns\" and \"House of Payne\" \"coonery and buffoonery.\" In a profile of Perry for New York magazine, in 2015, Rembert Browne wrote that the negative feelings toward the director \"aren't about his business sense, his ability to direct, or his acting chops-typically, they're about him as a net loss for the black race.\"\n\nOver time, though, the wholesale critical rejection of Perry has softened into a begrudging acceptance, and perhaps even a cringing love. When \"Boo! A Madea Halloween\" came out, I received texts from friends, their tones hesitant, asking if we should go see it. \"I did not expect to enjoy this show,\" Browne wrote, of seeing a production of \"Madea on the Run.\" \"But, after a few minutes, I slipped up and laughed.\" I laugh at Perry movies a lot, too. When I was a kid, my mother would buy bootlegs of his plays and films by the pack, from a kindly hawker who would come by the salon where she got her hair done. Back then, my critical faculties were barely developed, and I hadn't yet learned to distrust that which primitively pleased me. Movies were not mirrors. I hadn't yet come to understand that there is a ghastly aura surrounding the activity of black consumption, shading the outré with a pallor of paranoia and pain.\n\nAt the time Spike Lee made his comments, Perry responded by accusing the auteur of bourgie condescension. \"Spike Lee can go straight to hell,\" he said, at a press conference for \"Madea's Big Happy Family.\" Then he grew grandiose: \"Booker T. Washington and W. E. B. DuBois went through the exact same thing. Langston Hughes said that Zora Neale Hurston, the woman who wrote 'Their Eyes Were Watching God,' was a new version of the 'darkie' because she spoke in a Southern dialect and a Southern tone. And I'm sick of it from us; we don't have to worry about anybody else trying to destroy us and take shots, because we do it to ourselves.\" Perry had clearly lost all sense of proportion; \"Madea Goes to Jail\" is not as rich a text as Hurston's \"How it Feels to Be Colored Me.\" (Although Perry's artistic intent feels more guileless than chauvinistic, I'm not thrilled by the idea of girls watching his films without debriefs.) But I think that black women who are entertained by Perry, from his initial audience of churchgoers to younger, secular crowds, are not deriving their sense of personal esteem from his sermons. Lee later admitted just as much; in an interview with Oprah, who has long been a business partner and advocate of Perry's, Lee said that he thought he might work with Perry one day. Perry's pure eschewal of white opinion, and his Trojan-horsing of black talent, is admirable. While white Hollywood was underselling the skills of Lynn Whitfield, Viola Davis, Taraji P. Henson, and Gabrielle Union, Perry was giving these performers platforms. Madea is stupid, but her stupidity is comfortably numbing, an anesthetic injected into the part of my brain that demands the impossible of black women onscreen.\n\nTo mark her retirement, Perry is taking Madea on a countrywide farewell stage tour. Beyoncé and Jay-Z went to one of the performances. I can't, in good conscience, recommend \"A Madea Family Funeral\" or subject it to the pressure of critical analysis. The plot is that Madea and her posse of horny senior citizens (including Perry as Madea's brother Joe and a wheelchair-bound war veteran named Heathrow) walk in on a commotion in a hotel room. On the day of his wedding anniversary, a relative of Madea's had scheduled a tryst with his dominatrix mistress, and then lost consciousness during the act. The sight of leather-bound breasts, Joe suggests, has stunned him into a heart attack; the creepy mortician demonstrates to the family that the corpse's lingering erection prevents the casket from staying shut. In typical Perry fashion, Madea, who guards the infidelity from the widow, says one wise thing: \"Folk get mad at you when you tell them something about they husband.\" The widow, in a teary sequence, reveals that her husband emotionally abused her, and that she's happy that he's dead. Then she toodle-loos off to Vegas, her overnight \"ho bag\" in hand, and her new beau, played by Mike Tyson, waiting outside in a car. This apparent slackening of Perry's conservatism is perhaps the surest sign that Madea's work here is done. Her reign was ridiculous, and it was ours.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "White Like Me\n\nIn 1982, an investment banker named Richard Grand-Jean took a summer's lease on an eighteenth-century farmhouse in Fairfield, Connecticut; its owner, Anatole Broyard, spent his summers in Martha's Vineyard. The house was handsomely furnished with period antiques, and the surrounding acreage included a swimming pool and a pond. But the property had another attraction, too. Grand-Jean, a managing director of Salomon Brothers, was an avid reader, and he took satisfaction in renting from so illustrious a figure. Anatole Broyard had by then been a daily book reviewer for the Times for more than a decade, and that meant that he was one of literary America's foremost gatekeepers. Grand-Jean might turn to the business pages of the Times first, out of professional obligation, but he turned to the book page next, out of a sense of self. In his Walter Mittyish moments, he sometimes imagined what it might be like to be someone who read and wrote about books for a living-someone to whom millions of readers looked for guidance.\n\nBroyard's columns were suffused with both worldliness and high culture. Wry, mandarin, even self-amused at times, he wrote like a man about town, but one who just happened to have all of Western literature at his fingertips. Always, he radiated an air of soigné self-confidence: he could be amiable in his opinions or waspish, but he never betrayed a flicker of doubt about what he thought. This was a man who knew that his judgment would never falter and his sentences never fail him.\n\nGrand-Jean knew little about Broyard's earlier career, but as he rummaged through Broyard's bookshelves he came across old copies of intellectual journals like Partisan Review and Commentary , to which Broyard had contributed a few pieces in the late forties and early fifties. One day, Grand-Jean found himself leafing through a magazine that contained an early article by Broyard. What caught his eye, though, was the contributor's note for the article-or, rather, its absence. It had been neatly cut out, as if with a razor.\n\nA few years later, Grand-Jean happened on another copy of that magazine, and decided to look up the Broyard article again. This time, the note on the contributor was intact. It offered a few humdrum details-that Broyard was born in New Orleans, attended Brooklyn College and the New School for Social Research, and taught at New York University's Division of General Education. It also offered a less humdrum one: the situation of the American Negro, the note asserted, was a subject that the author \"knows at first hand.\" It was an elliptical formulation, to be sure, but for Anatole Broyard it may not have been elliptical enough.\n\nBroyard was born black and became white, and his story is compounded of equal parts pragmatism and principle. He knew that the world was filled with such snippets and scraps of paper, all conspiring to reduce him to an identity that other people had invented and he had no say in. Broyard responded with X-Acto knives and evasions, with distance and denials and half denials and cunning half-truths. Over the years, he became a virtuoso of ambiguity and equivocation. Some of his acquaintances knew the truth; many more had heard rumors about \"distant\" black ancestry (wasn't there a grandfather who was black? a great-grandfather?). But most were entirely unaware, and that was as he preferred it. He kept the truth even from his own children. Society had decreed race to be a matter of natural law, but he wanted race to be an elective affinity, and it was never going to be a fair fight. A penalty was exacted. He shed a past and an identity to become a writer-a writer who wrote endlessly about the act of shedding a past and an identity.\n\nAnatole Paul Broyard was born on July 16, 1920, in New Orleans to Paul Broyard and Edna Miller. His father was a carpenter and worked as a builder, along with his brothers; neither parent had graduated from elementary school. Anatole spent his early years in a modest house on St. Ann Street, in a colored neighborhood in the French Quarter. Documents in the Louisiana state archives show all Anatole's ancestors, on both sides, to have been Negroes, at least since the late eighteenth century. The rumor about a distant black ancestor was, in a sense, the reverse of the truth: he may have had one distant white ancestor. Of course, the conventions of color stratification within black America-nowhere more pronounced than in New Orleans-meant that light-skinned blacks often intermarried with other light-skinned blacks, and this was the case with Paul and his \"high yellow\" wife, Edna. Anatole was the second of three children; he and his sister Lorraine, two years older, were light-skinned, while Shirley, two years younger, was not so light-skinned. (The inheritance of melanin is an uneven business.) In any event, the family was identified as Negro, and identified itself as Negro. It was not the most interesting thing about them. But in America it was not a negligible social fact. The year before Anatole's birth, for example, close to a hundred blacks were lynched in the South and anti-black race riots claimed the lives of hundreds more.\n\nWhile Anatole was still a child, the family moved to the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, thus joining the great migration that took hundreds of thousands of Southern blacks to Northern cities during the twenties. In the French Quarter, Paul Broyard had been a legendary dancer, beau, and galant ; in the French Quarter, the Broyards-Paul was one of ten siblings-were known for their craftsmanship. Brooklyn was a less welcoming environment. \"He should never have left New Orleans, but my mother nagged him into it,\" Broyard recalled years later. Though Paul Broyard arrived there a master carpenter, he soon discovered that the carpenters' union was not favorably inclined toward colored applicants. A stranger in a strange city, Paul decided to pass as white in order to join the union and get work. It was strictly a professional decision, which affected his work and nothing else.\n\nFor Paul, being colored was a banal fact of life, which might be disguised when convenient; it was not a creed or something to take pride in. Paul did take pride in his craft, and he liked to boast of rescuing projects from know-nothing architects. He filled his home with furniture he had made himself-flawlessly professional, if a little too sturdily built to be stylish. He also took pride in his long legs and his dance-hall agility (an agility Anatole would share). It was a challenge to be a Brooklyn galant , but he did his best.\n\n\"Family life was very congenial, it was nice and warm and cozy, but we just didn't have any sort of cultural or intellectual nourishment at home,\" Shirley, who was the only member of the family to graduate from college, recalls. \"My parents had no idea even what the New York Times was, let alone being able to imagine that Anatole might write for it.\" She says, \"Anatole was different from the beginning.\" There was a sense, early on, that Anatole Broyard-or Buddy, as he was called then-was not entirely comfortable being a Broyard.\n\nShirley has a photograph, taken when Anatole was around four or five, of a family visit back to New Orleans. In it you can see Edna and her two daughters, and you can make out Anatole, down the street, facing in the opposite direction. The configuration was, Shirley says, pretty representative. After graduating from Boys High School, in the late thirties, he enrolled in Brooklyn College. Already, he had a passion for modern culture-for European cinema and European literature. The idea that meaning could operate on several levels seemed to appeal to him. Shirley recalls exasperating conversations along those lines: \"He'd ask me about a Kafka story I'd read or a French film I'd seen and say, 'Well, you see that on more than one level, don't you?' I felt like saying 'Oh, get off it.' Brothers don't say that to their sisters.\"\n\nJust after the war began, he got married, to a black Puerto Rican woman, Aida, and they soon had a daughter. (He named her Gala, after Salvador Dali's wife.) Shirley recalls, \"He got married and had a child on purpose-the purpose being to stay out of the Army. Then Anatole goes in the Army anyway, in spite of this child.\" And his wife and child moved in with the Broyard family.\n\nThough his military records were apparently destroyed in a fire, some people who knew him at this time say that he entered the segregated Army as a white man. If so, he must have relished the irony that after attending officers' training school he was made the captain of an all-black stevedore battalion. Even then, his thoughts were not far from the new life he envisioned for himself. He said that he joined the Army with a copy of Wallace Stevens in his back pocket; now he was sending money home to his wife and asking her to save it so that he could open a bookstore in the Village when he got back. \"She had other ideas,\" Shirley notes. \"She wanted him to get a nice job, nine to five.\"\n\nBetween Aida and the allure of a literary life there was not much competition. Soon after his discharge from the Army, at war's end, he found an apartment in the Village, and he took advantage of the G.I. Bill to attend evening classes at the New School for Social Research, on Twelfth Street. His new life had no room for Aida and Gala. (Aida, with the child, later moved to California and remarried.) He left other things behind, too. The black scholar and dramatist W. F. Lucas, who knew Buddy Broyard from Bed-Stuy, says, \"He was black when he got into the subway in Brooklyn, but as soon as he got out at West Fourth Street he became white.\"\n\nHe told his sister Lorraine that he had resolved to pass so that he could be a writer, rather than a Negro writer. His darker-skinned younger sister, Shirley, represented a possible snag, of course, but then he and Shirley had never been particularly close, and anyway she was busy with her own life and her own friends. (Shirley graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Hunter College, and went on to marry Franklin Williams, who helped organize the Peace Corps and served as Ambassador to Ghana.) They had drifted apart: it was just a matter of drifting farther apart. Besides, wasn't that why everybody came to New York-to run away from the confines of family, from places where people thought they knew who and what you were? Whose family wasn't in some way unsuitable? In a Times column in 1979 Broyard wrote, \"My mother and father were too folksy for me, too colorful. . . . Eventually, I ran away to Greenwich Village, where no one had been born of a mother and father, where the people I met had sprung from their own brows, or from the pages of a bad novel. . . . Orphans of the avant-garde, we outdistanced our history and our humanity.\" Like so much of what he wrote in this vein, it meant more than it said; like the modernist culture he loved, it had levels.\n\nIn the Village, where Broyard started a bookstore on Cornelia Street, the salient thing about him wasn't that he was black but that he was beautiful, charming, and erudite. In those days, the Village was crowded with ambitious and talented young writers and artists, and Broyard-known for calling men \"Sport\" and girls \"Slim\"-was never more at home. He could hang out at the San Remo bar with Dwight Macdonald and Delmore Schwartz, and with a younger set who yearned to be the next Macdonalds and the next Schwartzes. Vincent Livelli, a friend of Broyard's since Brooklyn College days, recalls, \"Everybody was so brilliant around us-we kept duelling with each other. But he was the guy that set the pace in the Village.\" His conversation sparkled-everybody said so. The sentences came out perfectly formed, festooned with the most apposite literary allusions. His high-beam charm could inspire worship but also resentment. Livelli says, \"Anatole had a sort of dancing attitude toward life-he'd dance away from you. He had people understand that he was brilliant and therefore you couldn't hold him if you weren't worthy of his attention.\"\n\nThe novelist and editor Gordon Lish says, \"Photographs don't suggest in any wise the enormous power he had in person. No part of him was ever for a moment at rest.\" He adds, \"I adored him as a man. I mean, he was really in a league with Neal Cassady as a kind of presence.\" But there was, he says, a fundamental difference between Broyard and Kerouac's inspiration and muse: \"Unlike Cassady, who was out of control, Anatole was exorbitantly in control. He was fastidious about managing things.\"\n\nExcept, perhaps, the sorts of things you're supposed to manage. His bookstore provided him with entrée to Village intellectuals-and them with entrée to Anatole-yet it was not run as a business, exactly. Its offerings were few but choice: Céline, Kafka, other hard-to-find translations. The critic Richard Gilman, who was one of its patrons, recalls that Broyard had a hard time parting with the inventory: \"He had these books on the shelf, and someone would want to buy one, and he would snatch it back.\"\n\nAround 1948, Broyard started to attract notice not merely for his charm, his looks, and his conversation but for his published writings. The early pieces, as often as not, were about a subject to which he had privileged access: blacks and black culture. Commentary , in his third appearance in its pages, dubbed him an \"anatomist of the Negro personality in a white world.\" But was he merely an anthropologist or was he a native informant? It wasn't an ambiguity that he was in any hurry to resolve. Still, if all criticism is a form of autobiography (as Oscar Wilde would have it), one might look to these pieces for clues to his preoccupations at the time. In a 1950 Commentary article entitled \"Portrait of the Inauthentic Negro,\" he wrote that the Negro's embarrassment over blackness should be banished by the realization that \"thousands of Negroes with 'typical' features are accepted as whites merely because of light complexion.\" He continued:\n\nThe inauthentic Negro is not only estranged from whites-he is also estranged from his own group and from himself. Since his companions are a mirror in which he sees himself as ugly, he must reject them; and since his own self is mainly a tension between an accusation and a denial, he can hardly find it, much less live in it. . . . He is adrift without a role in a world predicated on roles.\n\nA year later, in \"Keep Cool, Man: The Negro Rejection of Jazz,\" he wrote, just as despairingly, that the Negro's\n\ncontact with white society has opened new vistas, new ideals in his imagination, and these he defends by repression, freezing up against the desire to be white, to have normal social intercourse with whites, to behave like them. . . . But in coolness he evades the issue . . . he becomes a pacifist in the struggle between social groups-not a conscientious objector, but a draft-dodger.\n\nThese are words that could be read as self-indictment, if anybody chose to do so. Certainly they reveal a ticklish sense of the perplexities he found himself in, and a degree of self-interrogation (as opposed to self-examination) he seldom displayed again.\n\nIn 1950, in a bar near Sheridan Square, Broyard met Anne Bernays, a Barnard junior and the daughter of Edward L. Bernays, who is considered the father of public relations. \"There was this guy who was the handsomest man I have ever seen in my life, and I fell madly in love with him,\" Bernays, who is best known for such novels as \"Growing Up Rich\" and \"Professor Romeo,\" recalls. \"He was physically irresistible, and he had this dominating personality, and I guess I needed to be dominated. His hair was so short that you couldn't tell whether it was curly or straight. He had high cheekbones and very smooth skin.\" She knew that he was black, through a mutual friend, the poet and Blake scholar Milton Klonsky. (Years later, in a sort of epiphany, she recognized Anatole's loping walk as an African-American cultural style: \"It was almost as if this were inside him dying to get out and express itself, but he felt he couldn't do it.\")\n\nAfter graduation, she got a job as an editor at the literary semiannual Discovery . She persuaded Broyard to submit his work, and in 1954 the magazine ran a short story entitled \"What the Cystoscope Said\"-an extraordinary account of his father's terminal illness:\n\nI didn't recognize him at first, he was so bad. His mouth was open and his breathing was hungry. They had removed his false teeth, and his cheeks were so thin that his mouth looked like a keyhole. I leaned over his bed and brought my face before his eyes. \"Hello darlin',\" he whispered, and he smiled. His voice, faint as it was, was full of love, and it bristled the hairs on the nape of my neck and raised goose flesh on my forearms. I couldn't speak, so I kissed him. His cheek smelled like wax.\n\nOvernight, Broyard's renown was raised to a higher level. \"Broyard knocked people flat with 'What the Cystoscope Said,' \" Lish recalls. One of those people was Burt Britton, a bookseller who later co‐founded Books & Co. In the fifties, he says, he read the works of young American writers religiously: \"Now, if writing were a horse race, which God knows it's not, I would have gone out and put my two bucks down on Broyard.\" In \"Advertisements for Myself,\" Norman Mailer wrote that he'd buy a novel by Broyard the day it appeared. Indeed, Bernays recalls, on the basis of that story the Atlantic Monthly Press offered Broyard a twenty-thousand-dollar advance-then a staggeringly large sum for a literary work by an unknown-for a novel of which \"Cystoscope\" would be a chapter. \"The whole literary world was waiting with bated breath for this great novelist who was about to arrive,\" Michael Vincent Miller, a friend of Broyard's since the late fifties, recalls. \"Some feelings of expectation lasted for years.\"\n\nRumor surrounded Broyard like a gentle murmur, and sometimes it became a din. Being an orphan of the avant-garde was hard work. Among the black literati, certainly, his ancestry was a topic of speculation, and when a picture of Broyard accompanied a 1958 Time review of a Beat anthology it was closely scrutinized. Arna Bontemps wrote to Langston Hughes, \"His picture . . . makes him look Negroid. If so he is the only spade among the Beat Generation.\" Charlie Parker spied Broyard in Washington Square Park one day and told a companion, \"He's one of us, but he doesn't want to admit he's one of us.\" Richard Gilman recalls an awkwardness that ensued when he stumbled across Anatole with his dark-skinned wife and child: \"I just happened to come upon them in a restaurant that was not near our usual stomping grounds. He introduced me, and it was fine, but my sense was that he would rather not have had anyone he knew meet them.\" He adds, \"I remember thinking at the time that he had the look of an octoroon or a quadroon, one of those-which he strenuously denied. He got into very great disputes with people.\"\n\nOne of those disputes was with Chandler Brossard, who had been a close friend: Broyard was the best man at Brossard's wedding. There was a falling out, and Brossard produced an unflattering portrait of Broyard as the hustler and opportunist Henry Porter in his 1952 novel, \"Who Walk in Darkness.\" Brossard knew just where Broyard was most vulnerable, and he pushed hard. His novel originally began, \"People said Henry Porter was a Negro,\" and the version published in France still does. Apparently fearing legal action, however, Brossard's American publisher, New Directions, sent it to Broyard in galley form before it was published.\n\nAnne Bernays was with Broyard when the galleys arrived. Broyard explained to her, \"They asked me to read it because they are afraid I am going to sue.\" But why would he sue, she wanted to know. \"Because it says I'm a Negro,\" he replied grimly. \"Then,\" Bernays recalls, \"I said, 'What are you going to do?' He said, 'I am going to make them change it.' And he did.\"\n\nThe novel went on to be celebrated as a groundbreaking chronicle of Village hipsters; it also-as a result of the legal redactions-reads rather oddly in places. Henry Porter, the Broyard character, is rumored to be not a Negro but merely \"an illegitimate\":\n\nI suspect [the rumor] was supposed to explain the difference between the way he behaved and the way the rest of us behaved. Porter did not show that he knew people were talking about him this way. I must give him credit for maintaining a front of indifference that was really remarkable.\n\nSomeone both Porter and I knew quite well once told me the next time he saw Porter he was going to ask him if he was or was not an illegitimate. He said it was the only way to clear the air. Maybe so. But I said I would not think of doing it. . . . I felt that if Porter ever wanted the stories about himself cleared up, publicly, he would one day do so. I was willing to wait.\n\nAnd that, after all, is the nature of such secrets: they are not what cannot be known but what cannot be acknowledged.\n\nAnother trip wire seems to have landed Broyard in one of the masterpieces of twentieth-century American fiction, William Gaddis's \"The Recognitions.\" Livelli explains, \"Now, around 1947 or '48, William Gaddis and Anatole were in love with the same gal, Sheri Martinelli. They were rivals, almost at each other's throats. And Willie was such a sweetheart that he had a mild approach to everything, and Anatole was sort of a stabber: he injected words like poison into conversations.\" When \"The Recognitions\" came out, in 1955, \"Anatole caught on to it right away, and he was kind of angry over it.\" The Broyard character is named Max, and Gaddis wrote that he \"always looked the same, always the same age, his hair always the same short length,\" seemingly \"a parody on the moment, as his clothes caricatured a past at eastern colleges where he had never been.\" Worse is his \"unconscionable smile,\" which intimates \"that the wearer knew all of the dismal secrets of some evil jungle whence he had just come.\"\n\nBroyard's own account of these years-published in 1993 as \"Kafka Was the Rage\"-is fuelled by the intertwined themes of writing and women. Gaddis says, \"His eyes were these great pools-soft, gentle pools. It was girls, girls, girls: a kind of intoxication of its own. I always thought, frankly, that that's where his career went, his creative energies.\"\n\nAnne Bernays maintains, \"If you leave the sex part out, you're only telling half the story. With women, he was just like an alcoholic with booze.\" She stopped seeing him in 1952, at her therapist's urging. \"It was like going cold turkey off a drug,\" she says, remembering how crushing the experience was, and she adds, \"I think most women have an Anatole in their lives.\"\n\nIndeed, not a few of them had Anatole. \"He was a pussy gangster, really,\" Lucas, a former professor of comparative literature, says with Bed-Stuy bluntness. Gilman recalls being in Bergdorf Goodman and coming across Broyard putting the moves on a salesgirl. \"I hid behind a pillar-otherwise he'd know that I'd seen him-and watched him go through every stage of seduction: 'What do you think? Can I put this against you? Oh, it looks great against your skin. You have the most wonderful skin.' And then he quoted Baudelaire.\"\n\nQuoting Baudelaire turns out to be key. Broyard's great friend Ernest van den Haag recalls trolling the Village with Broyard in those days: \"We obviously quite often compared our modus operandi, and what I observed about Anatole is that when he liked a girl he could speak to her brilliantly about all kinds of things which the girl didn't in the least understand, because Anatole was really vastly erudite. The girl had no idea what he was talking about, but she loved it, because she was under the impression, rightly so, that she was listening to something very interesting and important. His was a solipsistic discourse, in some ways.\" Indeed, the narrator of \"What the Cystoscope Said\" tells of seducing his ailing father's young and ingenuous nurse in a similar manner:\n\n\"Listen,\" I said, borrowing a tone of urgency from another source, \"I want to give you a book. A book that was written for you, a book that belongs to you as much as your diary, that's dedicated to you like your nurse's certificate.\" . . . My apartment was four blocks away, so I bridged the distance with talk, raving about Journey to the End of the Night , the book she needed like she needed a hole in her head.\n\nBroyard recognized that seduction was a matter not only of talking but of listening, too, and he knew how to pay attention with an engulfing level of concentration. The writer Ellen Schwamm, who met Broyard in the late fifties, says, \"You show me a man who talks, and I'll show you a thousand women who hurl themselves at his feet. I don't mean just talk, I mean dialogues . He listened, and he was willing to speak of things that most men are not interested in: literature and its effect on life.\" But she also saw another side to Broyard's relentless need to seduce. She invokes a formulation made by her husband, the late Harold Brodkey: \"Harold used to say that a lot of men steal from women. They steal bits of their souls, bits of their personalities, to construct an emotional life, which many men don't have. And I think that Anatole needed something of that sort.\"\n\nIt's an image of self-assemblage which is very much in keeping with Broyard's own accounts of himself. Starting in 1946, and continuing at intervals for the rest of his life, he underwent analysis. Yet the word \"analysis\" is misleading: what he wanted was to be refashioned-or, as he told his first analyst, to be transfigured . \"When I came out with the word, I was like someone who sneezes into a handkerchief and finds it full of blood,\" he wrote in the 1993 memoir. \"I wanted to discuss my life with him not as a patient talking to an analyst but as if we were two literary critics discussing a novel. . . . I had a literature rather than a personality, a set of fictions about myself.\" He lived a lie because he didn't want to live a larger lie: and Anatole Broyard, Negro writer, was that larger lie.\n\nAlexandra Nelson, known as Sandy, met Broyard in January of 1961. Broyard was forty, teaching the odd course at the New School and supporting himself by freelancing: promotional copy for publishers, liner notes for Columbia jazz records, blurbs for the Book-of-the-Month Club. Sandy was twenty-three and a dancer, and Broyard had always loved dancers. Of Norwegian descent, she was strikingly beautiful, and strikingly intelligent. Michael Miller recalls, \"She represented a certain kind of blonde, a certain kind of sophisticated carnage and a way of moving through the world with a sense of the good things. They both had marvellous taste.\"\n\nIt was as if a sorcerer had made a list of everything Broyard loved and had given it life. At long last, the conqueror was conquered: in less than a year, Broyard and Sandy were married. Sandy remembers his aura in those days: \"Anatole was very hip. It wasn't a pose-it was in his sinew, in his bones. And, when he was talking to you, you just felt that you were receiving all this radiance from him.\" (Van den Haag says, \"I do think it's not without significance that Anatole married a blonde, and about as white as you can get. He may have feared a little bit that the children might turn out black. He must have been pleased that they didn't.\")\n\nWhile they were still dating, two of Broyard's friends told Sandy that he was black, in what seemed to be a clumsy attempt to scare her off. \"I think they really weren't happy to lose him, to see him get into a serious relationship,\" she says. \"They were losing a playmate, in a way.\" Whatever the cultural sanctions, she was unfazed. But she says that when she asked Broyard about it he proved evasive: \"He claimed that he wasn't black, but he talked about 'island influences,' or said that he had a grandmother who used to live in a tree on some island in the Caribbean. Anatole was like that-he was very slippery.\" Sandy didn't force the issue, and the succeeding years only fortified his sense of reserve. \"Anatole was very strong,\" she says. \"And he said about certain things, 'Just keep out. This is the deal if you get mixed up with me.' \" The life that Broyard chose to live meant that the children did not meet their Aunt Shirley until after his death-nor, except for a couple of brief visits in the sixties, was there any contact even with Broyard's light-skinned mother and older sister. It was a matter of respecting the ground rules. \"I would try to poke in those areas, but the message was very direct and strong,\" Sandy explains. \"Oh, when I got angry at him, you know, one always pushes the tender points. But over time you grow up about these things and realize you do what you can do and there are certain things you can't.\"\n\nIn 1963, just before their first child, Todd, was born, Anatole shocked his friends by another big move-to Connecticut. Not only was he moving to Connecticut but he was going to be commuting to work: for the first time in his life, he would be a company man. \"I think one of his claims to fame was that he hadn't had an office job-somehow, he'd escaped that,\" Sandy says. \"There had been no real need for him to grow up.\" But after Todd was born-a daughter, Bliss, followed in 1966-Anatole spent seven years working full-time as a copywriter at the Manhattan advertising agency Wunderman Ricotta & Kline.\n\nOver the next quarter century, the family lived in a series of eighteenth-century houses, sometimes bought on impulse, in places like Fairfield, Redding, Greens Farms, and Southport. Here, in a land of leaf-blowers and lawnmowers, Bed-Stuy must have seemed almost comically remote. Many of Broyard's intimates from the late forties knew about his family; the intimates he acquired in the sixties did not, or else had heard only rumors. Each year, the number of people who knew Buddy from Bed-Stuy dwindled; each year, the rumors grew more nebulous; each year, he left his past further behind. Miller says, \"Anatole was a master at what Erving Goffman calls 'impression management.' \" The writer Evelyn Toynton says, \"I remember once going to a party with Sandy and him in Connecticut. There were these rather dull people there, stockbrokers and the usual sorts of people, and Anatole just knocked himself out to charm every single person in the room. I said to him, 'Anatole, can't you ever not be charming?' \" Miller observes, \"He was a wonderful host. He could take people from different walks of life-the president of Stanley Tools or a vice-president of Merrill Lynch, say, and some bohemian type from the Village-and keep the whole scene flowing beautifully. He had perfect pitch for the social encounter, like Jay Gatsby.\"\n\nIt was as if, wedded to an ideal of American self-fashioning, he sought to put himself to the ultimate test. It was one thing to be accepted in the Village, amid the Beats and hipsters and émigrés, but to gain acceptance in Cheever territory was an achievement of a higher order. \"Anatole, when he left the Village and went to Connecticut, was able not only to pass but even to be a kind of influential presence in that world of rich white Wasps,\" Miller says. \"Maybe that was a shallower part of the passing-to be accepted by Connecticut gentry.\"\n\nBroyard's feat raised eyebrows among some of his literary admirers: something borrowed, something new. Daphne Merkin, another longtime friend, detected \"a 'country-squire' tendency-a complicated tendency to want to establish a sort of safety through bourgeoisness. It was like a Galsworthy quality.\"\n\nEven in Arcadia, however, there could be no relaxation of vigilance: in his most intimate relationships, there were guardrails. Broyard once wrote that Michael Miller was one of the people he liked best in the world, and Miller is candid about Broyard's profound influence on him. Today, Miller is a psychotherapist, based in Cambridge, and the author, most recently, of \"Intimate Terrorism.\" From the time they met until his death, Broyard read to him the first draft of almost every piece he wrote. Yet a thirty-year friendship of unusual intimacy was circumscribed by a subject that they never discussed. \"First of all, I didn't know ,\" Miller says. \"I just had intuitions and had heard intimations. It was some years before I'd even put together some intuition and little rumblings-nothing ever emerged clearly. There was a certain tacit understanding between us to accept certain pathways as our best selves, and not challenge that too much.\" It was perhaps, he says a little sadly, a limitation on the relationship.\n\nIn the late sixties, Broyard wrote several front-page reviews for the Times Book Review . \"They were brilliant, absolutely sensational,\" the novelist Charles Simmons, who was then an assistant editor there, says. In 1971, the Times was casting about for a new daily reviewer, and Simmons was among those who suggested Anatole Broyard. It wasn't a tough sell. Arthur Gelb, at the time the paper's cultural editor, recalls, \"Anatole was among the first critics I brought to the paper. He was very funny, and he also had that special knack for penetrating hypocrisy. I don't think he was capable of uttering a boring sentence.\"\n\nYou could say that his arrival was a sign of the times. Imagine: Anatole Broyard, downtown flaneur and apostle of sex and high modernism, ensconced in what was, literarily speaking, the ultimate establishment perch. \"There had been an awful lot of very tame, very conventional people at the Times , and Broyard came in as a sort of ambassador from the Village and Village sophistication,\" Alfred Kazin recalls. Broyard had a highly developed appreciation of the paper's institutional power, and he even managed to use it to avenge wrongs done him in his Village days. Just before he started his job at the daily, he published a review in the Times Book Review of a new novel by one Chandler Brossard. The review began, \"Here's a book so transcendently bad it makes us fear not only for the condition of the novel in this country, but for the country itself.\"\n\nBroyard's reviews were published in alternation with those of Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, who has now been a daily reviewer at the Times for more than a quarter century, and who readily admits that Broyard's appointment did not gladden his heart. They hadn't got along particularly well when Lehmann-Haupt was an editor at the Times Book Review , nor did Lehmann-Haupt entirely approve of Broyard's status as a fabled libertine. So when A. M. Rosenthal, the paper's managing editor, was considering hiring him, Lehmann-Haupt expressed reservations. He recalls, \"Rosenthal was saying, 'Give me five reasons why not.' And I thoughtlessly blurted out, 'Well, first of all, he is the biggest ass man in town.' And Rosenthal rose up from his desk and said, 'If that were a disqualification for working for the New York Times' -and he waved-'this place would be empty!' \"\n\nBroyard got off to an impressive start. Lehmann-Haupt says, \"He had a wonderful way of setting a tone, and a wonderful way of talking himself through a review. He had good, tough instincts when it came to fiction. He had taste.\" And the jovial Herbert Mitgang, who served a stint as a daily reviewer himself, says, \"I always thought he was the most literary of the reviewers. There would be something like a little essay in his daily reviews.\"\n\nOccasionally, his acerbic opinions got him in trouble. There was, for example, the storm that attended an uncharitable review of a novel by Christy Brown, an Irish writer who was born with severe cerebral palsy. The review concluded:\n\nIt is unfortunate that the author of \"A Shadow on Summer\" is an almost total spastic-he is said to have typed his highly regarded first novel, \"Down All the Days,\" with his left foot-but I don't see how the badness of his second novel can be blamed on that. Any man who can learn to type with his left foot can learn to write better than he has here.\n\nThen, there was the controversial review of James Baldwin's piously sentimental novel of black suffering, \"If Beale Street Could Talk.\" Broyard wrote:\n\nIf I have to read one more description of the garbage piled up in the streets of Harlem, I may just throw protocol to the winds and ask whose garbage is it? I would like to remind Mr. Baldwin that the City Health Code stipulates that garbage must be put out in proper containers, not indiscriminately \"piled.\"\n\nNo one could accuse Broyard of proselytizing for progressive causes. Jason Epstein, for one, was quick to detect a neoconservative air in his reviews, and Broyard's old friend Ernest van den Haag, a longtime contributing editor at National Review , volunteers that he was available to set Broyard straight on the issues when the need arose. Broyard could be mischievous, and he could be tendentious. It did not escape notice that he was consistently hostile to feminist writers. \"Perhaps it's naïve of me to expect people to write reasonable books about emotionally charged subjects,\" one such review began, irritably. \"But when you have to read and review two or three books each week, you do get tired of 'understanding' so much personal bias. You reach a point where it no longer matters that the author's mistakes are well meant. You don't care that he or she is on the side of the angels: you just want them to tell the truth.\"\n\nNor did relations between the two daily reviewers ever become altogether cordial. Lehmann-Haupt tells of a time in 1974 when Broyard said that he was sick and couldn't deliver a review. Lehmann-Haupt had to write an extra review in less than a day, so that he could get to the Ali-Frazier fight the next night, where he had ringside seats. Later, when they discussed the match, Broyard seemed suspiciously knowledgeable about its particulars; he claimed that a friend of his had been invited by a television executive to watch it on closed-circuit TV. \"I waited about six months, because one of the charming things about Anatole was that he never remembered his lies,\" Lehmann-Haupt says, laughing. \"And I said, 'Did you see that fight?' And he said, 'Oh, yeah-I was there as a guest of this television executive.' That's why he couldn't write the review!\"\n\nBroyard had been teaching off and on at the New School since the late fifties, and now his reputation as a writing teacher began to soar. Certainly his fluent prose style, with its combination of grace and clarity, was a considerable recommendation. He was charismatic and magisterial, and, because he was sometimes brutal about students' work, they found it all the more gratifying when he was complimentary. Among his students were Paul Breslow, Robert Olen Butler, Daphne Merkin, and Hilma Wolitzer. Ellen Schwamm, who took a workshop with him in the early seventies, says, \"He had a gourmet's taste for literature and for language, and he was really able to convey that: it was a very sensual experience.\"\n\nThese were years of heady success and, at the same time, of a rising sense of failure. An arbiter of American writing, Broyard was racked by his inability to write his own magnum opus. In the fifties, the Atlantic Monthly Press had contracted for an autobiographical novel-the novel that was supposed to secure Broyard's fame, his place in contemporary literature-but, all these years later, he had made no progress. It wasn't for lack of trying. Lehmann-Haupt recalls his taking a lengthy vacation in order to get the book written. \"I remember talking to him-he was up in Vermont, where somebody had lent him a house-and he was in agony. He banished himself from the Vineyard, was clearly suffering, and he just couldn't do it.\" John Updike, who knew Broyard slightly from the Vineyard, was reminded of the anticipation surrounding Ellison's second novel: \"The most famous non-book around was the one that Broyard was not writing.\" (The two non-book writers were in fact quite friendly: Broyard admired Ellison not only as a writer but as a dancer-a high tribute from such an adept as Broyard.)\n\nSurrounded by analysts and psychotherapists-Sandy Broyard had become a therapist herself by this time-Broyard had no shortage of explanations for his inability to write his book. \"He did have a total writer's block,\" van den Haag says, \"and he was analyzed by various persons, but it didn't fully overcome the writer's block. I couldn't prevent him from going back to 'The Cystoscope' and trying to improve it. He made it, of course, not better but worse.\" Broyard's fluency as an essayist and a reviewer wasn't quite compensation. Charles Simmons says, \"He had produced all this charming criticism, but the one thing that mattered to him was the one thing he hadn't managed to do.\"\n\nAs the seventies wore on, Miller discussed the matter of blockage with his best friend in relatively abstract terms: he suggested that there might be something in Broyard's relationship to his family background that was holding him back. In the eighties, he referred Broyard to his own chief mentor in gestalt therapy, Isador From, and From became perhaps Broyard's most important therapist in his later years. \"In gestalt therapy, we talk a lot about 'unfinished business': anything that's incomplete, unfinished, haunts the whole personality and tends, at some level, to create inhibition or blockage,\" Miller says. \"You're stuck there at a certain point. It's like living with a partly full bladder all your life.\"\n\nSome people speculated that the reason Broyard couldn't write his novel was that he was living it-that race loomed larger in his life because it was unacknowledged, that he couldn't put it behind him because he had put it beneath him. If he had been a different sort of writer, it might not have mattered so much. But Merkin points out, \"Anatole's subject, even in fiction, was essentially himself. I think that ultimately he would have had to deal with more than he wanted to deal with.\"\n\nBroyard may have been the picture of serene self-mastery, but there was one subject that could reliably fluster him. Gordon Lish recalls an occasion in the mid-seventies when Burt Britton (who was married to a black woman) alluded to Anatole's racial ancestry. Lish says, \"Anatole became inflamed, and he left the room. He snapped, like a dog snapping-he barked at Britton. It was an ugly moment.\" To people who knew nothing about the matter, Broyard's sensitivities were at times simply perplexing. The critic Judith Dunford used to go to lunch with Broyard in the eighties. One day, Broyard mentioned his sister Shirley, and Dunford, idly making conversation, asked him what she looked like. Suddenly, she saw an extremely worried expression on his face. Very carefully, he replied, \"Darker than me.\"\n\nThere was, finally, no sanctuary. \"When the children were older, I began, every eighteen months or so, to bring up the issue of how they needed to know at some point,\" Sandy Broyard says. \"And then he would totally shut down and go into a rage. He'd say that at some point he would tell them, but he would not tell them now.\" He was the Scheherazade of racial imposture, seeking and securing one deferral after another. It must have made things not easier but harder. In the modern era, children are supposed to come out to their parents: it works better that way around. For children, we know, can judge their parents harshly-above all, for what they understand as failures of candor. His children would see the world in terms of authenticity; he saw the world in terms of self-creation. Would they think that he had made a Faustian bargain? Would they speculate about what else he had not told them-about the limits of self-invention? Broyard's resistance is not hard to fathom. He must have wondered when the past would learn its place, and stay past.\n\nAnatole Broyard had confessed enough in his time to know that confession did nothing for the soul. He preferred to communicate his truths on higher frequencies. As if in exorcism, Broyard's personal essays deal regularly with the necessary, guilt-ridden endeavor of escaping family history: and yet the feelings involved are well-nigh universal. The thematic elements of passing-fragmentation, alienation, liminality, self-fashioning-echo the great themes of modernism. As a result, he could prepare the way for exposure without ever risking it. Miller observes, \"If you look at the writing closely enough, and listen to the intonations, there's something there that is like no writer from the completely white world. Freud talked about the repetition compulsion. With Anatole, it's interesting that he was constantly hiding it and in some ways constantly revealing it.\"\n\nSandy speaks of these matters in calmly analytic tones; perhaps because she is a therapist, her love is tempered by an almost professional dispassion. She says, \"I think his own personal history continued to be painful to him,\" and she adds, \"In passing, you cause your family great anguish, but I also think, conversely, do we look at the anguish it causes the person who is passing? Or the anguish that it was born out of?\"\n\nIt may be tempting to describe Broyard's self-positioning as arising from a tortured allegiance to some liberal-humanist creed. In fact, the liberal pieties of the day were not much to his taste. \"It wasn't about an ideal of racelessness but something much more complex and interesting,\" Miller says. \"He was actually quite anti-black,\" Evelyn Toynton says. She tells of a time when she was walking with him on a street in New York and a drunken black man came up to him and asked for a dollar. Broyard seethed. Afterward, he remarked to her, \"I look around New York, and I think to myself, If there were no blacks in New York, would it really be any loss?\"\n\nNo doubt this is a calculation that whites, even white liberals, sometimes find themselves idly working out: How many black muggers is one Thelonious Monk worth? How many Willie Hortons does Gwendolyn Brooks redeem? In 1970, Ellison published his classic essay \"What America Would Be Like Without Blacks,\" in Time ; and one reason it is a classic essay is that it addresses a question that lingers in the American political unconscious. Commanding as Ellison's arguments are, there remains a whit of defensiveness in the very exercise. It's a burdensome thing to refute a fantasy.\n\nAnd a burdensome thing to be privy to it. Ellen Schwamm recalls that one of the houses Broyard had in Connecticut had a black jockey on the lawn, and that \"he used to tell me that Jimmy Baldwin had said to him, 'I can't come and see you with this crap on your lawn.' \" (Sandy remembers the lawn jockey-an antique-as having come with the house; she also recalls that it was stolen one day.) Charles Simmons says that the writer Herbert Gold, before introducing him to Broyard, warned him that Broyard was prone to make comments about \"spades,\" and Broyard did make a few such comments. \"He personally, on a deeper level, was not enamored of blacks,\" van den Haag says. \"He avoided blacks. There is no question he did.\" Sandy is gingerly in alluding to this subject. \"He was very short-tempered with the behavior of black people, the sort of behavior that was shown in the news. He had paid the price to be at liberty to say things that, if you didn't know he was black, you would misunderstand. I think it made him ironical.\"\n\nEvery once in a while, however, Broyard's irony would slacken, and he would speak of the thing with an unaccustomed and halting forthrightness. Toynton says that after they'd known each other for several years he told her there was a \"C\" (actually, \"col,\" for \"colored\") on his birth certificate. \"And then another time he told me that his sister was black and that she was married to a black man.\" The circumlocutions are striking: not that he was black but that his birth certificate was; not that he was black but that his family was. Perhaps this was a matter less of evasiveness than of precision.\n\n\"Some shrink had said to him that the reason he didn't like brown-haired women or dark women was that he was afraid of his own shit,\" Toynton continues. \"And I said, 'Anatole, it's as plain as plain can be that it has to do with being black.' And he just stopped and said, 'You don't know what it was like. It was horrible.' He told me once that he didn't like to see his sisters, because they reminded him of his unhappy childhood.\" (Shirley's account suggests that this unhappy childhood may have had more to do with the child than with the hood.)\n\nEllen Schwamm remembers one occasion when Broyard visited her and Harold Brodkey at their apartment, and read them part of the memoir he was working on. She says that the passages seemed stilted and distant, and that Brodkey said to him, \"You're not telling the truth, and if you try to write lies or evade the truth this is what you get. What's the real story?\" She says, \"Anatole took a deep breath and said, 'The real story is that I'm not who I seem. I'm a black.' I said, 'Well, Anatole, it's no great shock, because this rumor has been around for years and years and years, and everyone assumes there's a small percentage of you that's black, if that's what you're trying to say.' And he said, 'No, that's not what I'm trying to say. My father could pass, but in fact my mother's black, too. We're black as far back as I know.' We never said a word of it to anybody, because he asked us not to.\"\n\nSchwamm also says that she begged him to write about his history: it seemed to her excellent material for a book. But he explained that he didn't want notoriety based on his race-on his revealing himself to be black-rather than on his talent. As Toynton puts it, Broyard felt that he had to make a choice between being an aesthete and being a Negro. \"He felt that once he said, 'I'm a Negro writer,' he would have to write about black issues, and Anatole was such an aesthete.\"\n\nAll the same, Schwamm was impressed by a paradox: the man wanted to be appreciated not for being black but for being a writer, even though his pretending not to be black was stopping him from writing. It was one of the very few ironies that Broyard, the master ironist, was ill equipped to appreciate.\n\nBesides, there was always his day job to attend to. Broyard might suffer through a midnight of the soul in Vermont; but he was also a working journalist, and when it came to filing his copy he nearly always met his deadlines. In the late seventies, he also began publishing brief personal essays in the Times . They are among the finest work he did-easeful, witty, perfectly poised between surface and depth. In them he perfected the feat of being self-revelatory without revealing anything. He wrote about his current life, in Connecticut: \"People in New York City have psychotherapists, and people in the suburbs have handymen. While anxiety in the city is existential, in the country it is structural.\" And he wrote about his earlier life, in the city: \"There was a kind of jazz in my father's movements, a rhythm compounded of economy and flourishes, functional and decorative. He had a blues song in his blood, a wistful jauntiness he brought with him from New Orleans.\" (Wistful, and even worrisome: \"I half-expected him to break into the Camel Walk, the Shimmy Shewobble, the Black Bottom or the Mess Around.\") In a 1979 essay he wrote about how much he dreaded family excursions:\n\nTo me, they were like a suicide pact. Didn't my parents know that the world was just waiting for a chance to come between us?\n\nInside, we were a family, but outside we were immigrants, bizarre in our differences. I thought that people stared at us, and my face grew hot. At any moment, I expected my father and mother to expose their tribal rites, their eccentric anthropology, to the gape of strangers.\n\nAnyone who saw me with my family knew too much about me.\n\nThese were the themes he returned to in many of his personal essays, seemingly marking out the threshold he would not cross. And if some of his colleagues at the Times knew too much about him, or had heard the rumors, they wouldn't have dreamed of saying anything. Abe Rosenthal (who did know about him) says that the subject never arose. \"What was there to talk about? I didn't really consider it my business. I didn't think it was proper or polite, nor did I want him to think I was prejudiced, or anything.\"\n\nBut most people knew nothing about it. C. Gerald Fraser, a reporter and an editor at the Times from 1967 until 1991, was friendly with Broyard's brother-in-law Ambassador Franklin Williams. Fraser, who is black, recalls that one day Williams asked him how many black journalists there were at the Times . \"I listed them,\" he says, \"and he said, 'You forgot one.' I went over the list again, and I said, 'What do you mean?' He said, 'Shirley's brother, Anatole Broyard.' I was dumbstruck, because I'd never heard it mentioned at the Times that he was black, or that the paper had a black critic.\"\n\nIn any event, Broyard's colleagues did not have to know what he was to have reservations about who he was. He cultivated his image as a trickster-someone who would bend the rules, finesse the system-and that image only intensified his detractors' ire. \"A good book review is an act of seduction, and when he did it there was nobody better,\" John Leonard says, but he feels that Broyard's best was not always offered. \"I considered him to be one of the laziest book reviewers to come down the pike.\" Soon a running joke was that Broyard would review only novels shorter than two hundred pages. In the introduction to \"Aroused by Books,\" a collection of the reviews he published in the early seventies, Broyard wrote that he tried to choose books for review that were \"closest to [his] feelings.\" Lehmann-Haupt says dryly, \"We began to suspect that he often picked the books according to the attractiveness of the young female novelists who had written them.\" Rosenthal had shamed him for voicing his disquiet about Broyard's reputation as a Don Juan, but before long Rosenthal himself changed his tune. \"Maybe five or six years later,\" Lehmann-Haupt recalls, \"Rosenthal comes up to me, jabbing me in the chest with a stiffened index finger and saying, 'The trouble with Broyard is that he writes with his cock!' I bit my tongue.\"\n\nGradually, a measure of discontent with Broyard's reviews began to make itself felt among the paper's cultural commissars. Harvey Shapiro, the editor of the Book Review from 1975 to 1983, recalls conversations with Rosenthal in which \"he would tell me that all his friends hated Anatole's essays, and I would tell him that all my friends loved Anatole's essays, and that would be the end of the conversation.\" In 1984, Broyard was removed from the daily Times and given a column in the Book Review .\n\nMitchel Levitas, the editor of the Book Review from 1983 to 1989, edited Broyard's column himself. He says, \"It was a tough time for him, you see, because he had come off the daily book review, where he was out there in the public eye twice a week. That was a major change in his public role.\" In addition to writing his column, he was put to work as an editor at the Book Review . The office environment was perhaps not altogether congenial to a man of his temperament. Kazin recalls, \"He complained to me constantly about being on the Book Review , because he had to check people's quotations and such. I think he thought that he was superior to the job.\"\n\nThen, too, it was an era in which the very notion of passing was beginning to seem less plangent than preposterous. Certainly Broyard's skittishness around the subject wasn't to everyone's liking. Brent Staples, who is black, was an editor at the Book Review at the time Broyard was there \"Anatole had it both ways,\" Staples says. \"He would give you a kind of burlesque wink that seemed to indicate he was ready to accept the fact of your knowing that he was a black person. It was a real ambiguity, tacit and sort of recessed. He jived around and played with it a lot, but never made it express the fact that he was black.\" It was a game that tried Staples' patience. \"When Anatole came anywhere near me, for example, his whole style, demeanor, and tone would change,\" he recalls. \"I took that as him conveying to me, 'Yes, I am like you. But I'm relating this to you on a kind of recondite channel.' Over all, it made me angry. Here was a guy who was, for a long period of time, probably one of the two or three most important critical voices on literature in the United States. How could you, actively or passively, have this fact hidden?\"\n\nStaples pauses, then says, \"You know, he turned it into a joke. And when you change something basic about yourself into a joke, it spreads, it metastasizes, and so his whole presentation of self became completely ironic. Everything about him was ironic.\"\n\nThere were some people who came to have a professional interest in achieving a measure of clarity on the topic. Not long before Broyard retired from the Times , in 1989, Daphne Merkin, as an editor at Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, gave him an advance of a hundred thousand dollars for his memoirs. (The completed portion was ultimately published, as \"Kafka Was the Rage,\" by Crown.) Merkin learned that \"he was, in some ways, opaque to himself,\" and her disquiet grew when the early chapters arrived. \"I said, 'Anatole, there's something odd here. Within the memoir, you have your family moving to a black neighborhood in Brooklyn. I find that strange-unless they're black.' I said, 'You can do many things if you're writing a memoir. But if you squelch stuff that seems to be crucial about you, and pretend it doesn't exist . . .' \" She observes that he was much attached to aspects of his childhood, but \"in a clouded way.\"\n\nWhen Broyard retired from the Times , he was nearly sixty-nine. To Sandy, it was a source of some anguish that their children still did not know the truth about him. Yet what was that truth? Broyard was a critic-a critic who specialized in European and American fiction. And what was race but a European and American fiction? If he was passing for white, perhaps he understood that the alternative was passing for black. \"But if some people are light enough to live like white, mother, why should there be such a fuss?\" a girl asks her mother in \"Near-White,\" a 1931 story by the Harlem Renaissance author Claude McKay. \"Why should they live colored when they could be happier living white?\" Why, indeed? One could concede that the passing of Anatole Broyard involved dishonesty; but is it so very clear that the dishonesty was mostly Broyard's?\n\nTo pass is to sin against authenticity, and \"authenticity\" is among the founding lies of the modern age. The philosopher Charles Taylor summarizes its ideology thus: \"There is a certain way of being human that is my way. I am called upon to live my life in this way, and not in imitation of anyone else's life. But this notion gives a new importance to being true to myself. If I am not, I miss the point of my life; I miss what being human is for me .\" And the Romantic fallacy of authenticity is only compounded when it is collectivized: when the putative real me gives way to the real us. You can say that Anatole Broyard was (by any juridical reckoning) \"really\" a Negro, without conceding that a Negro is a thing you can really be. The vagaries of racial identity were increased by what anthropologists call the rule of \"hypodescent\"-the one-drop rule. When those of mixed ancestry-and the majority of blacks are of mixed ancestry-disappear into the white majority, they are traditionally accused of running from their \"blackness.\" Yet why isn't the alternative a matter of running from their \"whiteness\"? To emphasize these perversities, however, is a distraction from a larger perversity. You can't get race \"right\" by refining the boundary conditions.\n\nThe act of razoring out your contributor's note may be quixotic, but it is not mad. The mistake is to assume that birth certificates and biographical sketches and all the other documents generated by the modern bureaucratic state reveal an anterior truth-that they are merely signs of an independently existing identity. But in fact they constitute it. The social meaning of race is established by these identity papers-by tracts and treatises and certificates and pamphlets and all the other verbal artifacts that proclaim race to be real and, by that proclamation, make it so.\n\nSo here is a man who passed for white because he wanted to be a writer, and he did not want to be a Negro writer. It is a crass disjunction, but it is not his crassness or his disjunction. His perception was perfectly correct. He would have had to be a Negro writer, which was something he did not want to be. In his terms, he did not want to write about black love, black passion, black suffering, black joy; he wanted to write about love and passion and suffering and joy. We give lip service to the idea of the writer who happens to be black, but had anyone, in the postwar era, ever seen such a thing?\n\nBroyard's friend Richard A. Shweder, an anthropologist and a theorist of culture, says, \"I think he believed that reality is constituted by style,\" and ascribes to Broyard a \"deeply romantic view of the intimate connection between style and reality.\" Broyard passed not because he thought that race wasn't important but because he knew that it was. The durable social facts of race were beyond reason, and, like Paul Broyard's furniture, their strength came at the expense of style. Anatole Broyard lived in a world where race had, indeed, become a trope for indelibility, for permanence. \"All I have to do,\" a black folk saying has it, \"is stay black and die.\"\n\nBroyard was a connoisseur of the liminal-of crossing over and, in the familiar phrase, getting over. But the ideologies of modernity have a kicker, which is that they permit no exit. Racial recusal is a forlorn hope. In a system where whiteness is the default, racelessness is never a possibility. You cannot opt out; you can only opt in. In a scathing review of a now forgotten black author, Broyard announced that it was time to reconsider the assumption of many black writers that \" 'whitey' will never let you forget you're black.\" For his part, he wasn't taking any chances. At a certain point, he seems to have decided that all he had to do was stay white and die.\n\nIn 1989, Broyard resolved that he and his wife would change their life once more. With both their children grown, they could do what they pleased. And what they pleased-what he pleased, anyway-was to move to Cambridge, Massachusetts. They would be near Harvard, and so part of an intellectual community. He had a vision of walking through Harvard Square, bumping into people like the sociologist Daniel Bell, and having conversations about ideas in the street. Besides, his close friend Michael Miller was living in the area. Anne Bernays, also a Cambridge resident, says, \"I remember his calling several times and asking me about neighborhoods. It was important for him to get that right. I think he was a little disappointed when he moved that it wasn't to a fancy neighborhood like Brattle or Channing Street. He was on Wendell Street, where there's a tennis court across the street and an apartment building and the houses are fairly close together.\" It wasn't a matter of passing so much as of positioning.\n\nSandy says that they had another the-children-must-be-told conversation shortly before the move. \"We were driving to Michael's fiftieth-birthday party-I used to plan to bring up the subject in a place where he couldn't walk out. I brought it up then because at that point our son was out of college and our daughter had just graduated, and my feeling was that they just absolutely needed to know, as adults.\" She pauses. \"And we had words. He would just bring down this gate.\" Sandy surmises, again, that he may have wanted to protect them from what he had experienced as a child. \"Also,\" she says, \"I think he needed still to protect himself.\" The day after they moved into their house on Wendell Street, Broyard learned that he had prostate cancer, and that it was inoperable.\n\nBroyard spent much of the time before his death, fourteen months later, making a study of the literature of illness and death, and publishing a number of essays on the subject. Despite the occasion, they were imbued with an almost dandyish, even jokey sense of incongruity: \"My urologist, who is quite famous, wanted to cut off my testicles. . . . Speaking as a surgeon, he said that it was the surest, quickest, neatest solution. Too neat, I said, picturing myself with no balls. I knew that such a solution would depress me, and I was sure that depression is bad medicine.\" He had attracted notice in 1954 with the account of his father's death from a similar cancer; now he recharged his writing career as a chronicler of his own progress toward death. He thought about calling his collection of writings on the subject \"Critically Ill.\" It was a pun he delighted in.\n\nSoon after the diagnosis was made, he was told that he might have \"in the neighborhood of years.\" Eight months later, it became clear that this prognosis was too optimistic. Richard Shweder, the anthropologist, talks about a trip to France that he and his wife made with Anatole and Sandy not long before Anatole's death. One day, the two men were left alone. Shweder says, \"And what did he want to do? He wanted to throw a ball. The two of us just played catch, back and forth.\" The moment, he believes, captures Broyard's athleticism, his love of physical grace.\n\nBroyard spent the last five weeks of his life at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, in Boston. In therapy sessions, the need to set things straight before the end had come up again-the need to deal with unfinished business and, most of all, with his secret. He appeared willing, if reluctant, to do so. But by now he was in almost constant pain, and the two children lived in different places, so the opportunities to have the discussion as a family were limited. \"Anatole was in such physical pain that I don't think he had the wherewithal,\" Sandy says. \"So he missed the opportunity to tell the children himself.\" She speaks of the expense of spirit, of psychic energy, that would have been required. The challenge would have been to explain why it had remained a secret. And no doubt the old anxieties were not easily dispelled: would it have been condemned as a Faustian bargain or understood as a case of personality overspilling, or rebelling against, the reign of category?\n\nIt pains Sandy even now that the children never had the chance to have an open discussion with their father. In the event, she felt that they needed to know before he died, and, for the first time, she took it upon herself to declare what her husband could not. It was an early afternoon, ten days before his death, when she sat down with her two children on a patch of grass across the street from the institute. \"They knew there was a family secret, and they wanted to know what their father had to tell them. And I told them.\"\n\nThe stillness of the afternoon was undisturbed. She says carefully, \"Their first reaction was relief that it was only this, and not an event or circumstance of larger proportions. Only following their father's death did they begin to feel the loss of not having known. And of having to reformulate who it was that they understood their father-and themselves-to be.\"\n\nAt this stage of his illness, Anatole was moving in and out of lucidity, but in his room Sandy and the children talked with humor and irony about secrets and about this particular secret. Even if Anatole could not participate in the conversation, he could at least listen to it. \"The nurses said that hearing was the last sense to go,\" Sandy says.\n\nIt was not as she would have planned it. She says, gently, \"Anatole always found his own way through things.\"\n\nThe writer Leslie Garis, a friend of the Broyards' from Connecticut, was in Broyard's room during the last weekend of September, 1990, and recorded much of what he said on his last day of something like sentience. He weighed perhaps seventy pounds, she guessed, and she describes his jaundice-clouded eyes as having the permanently startled look born of emaciation. He was partly lucid, mostly not. There are glimpses of his usual wit, but in a mode more aleatoric than logical. He spoke of Robert Graves, of Sheri Martinelli, of John Hawkes interpreting Miles Davis. He told Sandy that he needed to find a place to go where he could \"protect his irony.\" As if, having been protected by irony throughout his life, it was now time to return the favor.\n\n\"I think friends are coming, so I think we ought to order some food,\" he announced hours before he lapsed into his final coma. \"We'll want cheese and crackers, and Faust.\"\n\n\"Faust?\" Sandy asked.\n\nAnatole explained, \"He's the kind of guy who makes the Faustian bargain, and who can be happy only when the thing is revealed.\"\n\nA memorial service, held at a Congregationalist church in Connecticut, featured august figures from literary New York, colleagues from the Times , and neighbors and friends from the Village and the Vineyard. Charles Simmons told me that he was surprised at how hard he took Broyard's death. \"You felt that you were going to have him forever, the way you feel about your own child,\" he said. \"There was something wrong about his dying, and that was the reason.\" Speaking of the memorial service, he says, marvelling, \"You think that you're the close friend, you know? And then I realized that there were twenty people ahead of me. And that his genius was for close friends.\"\n\nIndeed, six years after Broyard's death many of his friends seem to be still mourning his loss. For them he was plainly a vital principle, a dancer and romancer, a seducer of men and women. (He considered seduction, he wrote, \"the most heartfelt literature of the self.\") Sandy tells me, simply, \"You felt more alive in his presence,\" and I've heard almost precisely the same words from a great many others. They felt that he lived more intensely than other men. They loved him-perhaps his male friends especially, or, anyway, more volubly-and they admired him. They speak of a limber beauty, of agelessness, of a radiance. They also speak of his excesses and his penchant for poses. Perhaps, as the bard has it, Broyard was \"much more the better for being a little bad.\"\n\nAnd if his presence in American fiction was pretty much limited to other people's novels, that is no small tribute to his personal vibrancy. You find him reflected and refracted in the books of his peers, like Anne Bernays (she says there is a Broyard character in every novel she's written) and Brossard and Gaddis, of course, but also in those of his students. His own great gift was as a feuilletonist. The personal essays collected in \"Men, Women and Other Anticlimaxes\" can put you in mind of \"The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table,\" by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. They are brief impromptus, tonally flawless. To read them is to feel that you are in the company of someone who is thinking things through. The essays are often urbane and sophisticated, but not unbearably so, and they can be unexpectedly moving. Literary culture still fetishizes the novel, and there he was perhaps out of step with his times. Sandy says, \"In the seventies and eighties, the trend, in literature and film, was to get sparer, and the flourish of Anatole's voice was dependent on the luxuriance of his language.\" Richard Shweder says, \"It does seem that Anatole's strength was the brief, witty remark. It was aphoristic. It was the critical review. He was brilliant in a thousand or two thousand words.\" Perhaps he wasn't destined to be a novelist, but what of it? Broyard was a Negro who wanted to be something other than a Negro, a critic who wanted to be something other than a critic. Broyard, you might say, wanted to be something other than Broyard. He very nearly succeeded.\n\nShirley Broyard Williams came to his memorial service, and many of his friends-including Alfred Kazin, who delivered one of the eulogies-remember being puzzled and then astonished as they realized that Anatole Broyard was black. For Todd and Bliss, however, meeting Aunt Shirley was, at last, a flesh-and-blood confirmation of what they had been told. Shirley is sorry that they didn't meet sooner, and she remains baffled about her brother's decision. But she isn't bitter about it; her attitude is that she has had a full and eventful life of her own-husband, kids, friends-and that if her brother wanted to keep himself aloof she respected his decision. She describes the conversations they had when they did speak: \"They always had to be focussed on something, like a movie, because you couldn't afford to be very intimate. There had to be something that would get in the way of the intimacy.\" And when she phoned him during his illness it was the same way. \"He never gave that up,\" she says, sounding more wistful than reproachful. \"He never learned how to be comfortable with me.\" So it has been a trying set of circumstances all around. \"The hypocrisy that surrounds this issue is so thick you could chew it,\" Shirley says wearily.\n\nShirley's husband died several months before Anatole, and I think she must have found it cheering to be able to meet family members who had been sequestered from her. She says that she wants to get to know her nephew and her niece-that there's a lot of time to make up. \"I've been encouraging Bliss to come and talk, and we had lunch, and she calls me on the phone. She's really responded very well. Considering that it's sort of last-minute.\"\n\nYears earlier, in an essay entitled \"Growing Up Irrational,\" Anatole Broyard wrote, \"I descended from my mother and father. I was extracted from them.\" His parents were \"a conspiracy, a plot against society,\" as he saw it, but also a source of profound embarrassment. \"Like every great tradition, my family had to die before I could understand how much I missed them and what they meant to me. When they went into the flames at the crematorium, all my letters of introduction went with them.\" Now that he had a wife and family of his own, he had started to worry about whether his children's feelings about him would reprise his feelings about his parents: \"Am I an embarrassment to them, or an accepted part of the human comedy? Have they joined my conspiracy, or are they just pretending? Do they understand that, after all those years of running away from home, I am still trying to get back?\" ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "The Generation After Malcolm X\n\n\"Do you know why the white man really hates you?\" Malcolm X would ask his black congregations in the nineteen-sixties. \"It's because every time he sees your face he sees a mirror of his crime-and his guilty conscience can't bear to face it.\" In the midst of what seemed the high moral adventure of Martin Luther King, Jr.,'s nonviolent civil-rights campaigns, Malcolm appeared as some marginal shadow-figure of wrath, always paralleling King's progress. A ghetto street hustler turned grimly austere evangelist for a racial subsect of Islam known as the Black Muslims, he became one of those unnerving black figures who periodically rise up before the eyes of white society as an image of its own systematic dehumanization, at once a casualty of and a judgment upon America's racism. In ghostly black-and-white news footage from that time, he can be glimpsed at street rallies of inner-city blacks-a long, lank, sober-suited figure, hatted and bespectacled-excoriating the white man in a level, measured tone with rapid licks of scorn: \"We don't want to have anything to do with any race of dogs.\" Spearing his forefinger in the air, he cries, \"Two-legged white dogs sicking four-legged dogs on your and my mother!\"\n\nTwenty-seven years after his sudden death, in a bedlam of gunfire in a Harlem auditorium, his presence still hangs palpably among us. It's not merely in the speckling of \"X\"s on caps and T-shirts which one now sees everywhere (even on Bill Clinton's jogging cap)-a ubiquitous pop rash that has anticipated the film biography by Spike Lee. In this cinematic Second Coming, Malcolm promises finally to pass, in one form at least, into the mythology of America. Of course, such theatrical reconstructions, like \"JFK\" and \"Mississippi Burning,\" can work their own polemically simplistic vandalisms on the past, coarsening the collective memory from which our understanding of our own times is formed.\n\nBeyond his ascension into the pop firmament, though, Malcolm abides among us in a far more elemental sense. From the turbulent black awakening of the sixties, two lines of descent-two temperaments, two potentials-have contended for the spirit of black Americans: a tension between the children of Martin and the children of Malcolm. Though King's perspective was far more radical than the eventual sentimentalism about him would lead one to suppose, it was suggested even in his day that his vision-of a transcendent, nonviolent struggle of moral confrontation that would shame a racist and essentially barbarous society into redemption-could never be more than a dream. But if it could be said that King's vision expected too much of the species, Malcolm's seemed a vision of humankind's nature reduced to the basest, most minimal terms of anger and retribution for abuse. Malcolm proclaimed to his black audiences that only fools \"could love someone who had treated them as the white man has treated you.\" He demonized the abuser as a \"blue-eyed white devil,\" genetically beyond any moral appeal, who would never consent to admit blacks into his company and was unworthy of such ambitions anyway-a predator who could properly be handled only with contempt and threat.\n\nTo no small degree, Martin and Malcolm were projections of two separate black cultures. King, the son of an eminent minister, had grown up in the comfortable insulation of Atlanta's black gentility-part of that black establishment eager to join in a civil-rights coalition with the nation's white liberal community. Malcolm, on the other hand, arose from the lowest reaches of the black urban underclass. In \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X,\" narrated shortly before his death to Alex Haley, Malcolm acknowledged, \"I know nothing about the South. I am a creation of the Northern white man and of his hypocritical attitude toward the Negro\"-an attitude closer, actually, to that of the nation as a whole.\n\nIt is now clear that Malcolm was in communion with submerged heats of anger far more widespread in the black community than most whites ever suspected. Peter Goldman, in his discerning 1973 biography, \"The Death and Life of Malcolm X,\" reports that when he was a newspaperman in St. Louis in the early sixties \"a bewildered cop told me that even the hookers and boosters were calling him a blue-eyed devil and would only talk to his black partner.\" Concurrent with King's nonviolent campaigns in the South was the emergence around the country of such guerrilla militants as the Black Panthers and radical young activists like Stokely Carmichael and H. Rap Brown, with their cries for \"black power!\" What disturbed some observers about this new phase of the movement was a contraction of its moral terms to a bitter cynicism that saw the human lot as one of hopeless racial alienation. I was covering the civil-rights movement in the South then, and one summer night in Greenwood, Mississippi, as King was conducting a mass meeting of fifteen hundred blacks in a local church, I sensed Malcolm's effect even there. King's voice pealed over the gathering, \"We have a power that's greater than all the guns in Mississippi, greater than all the bombs and armies of the world-we have the power of our souls! \" From several young partisans of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee scattered around the back of the church, there arose a counterpoint of derisive hoots: \"Oh, de Lawd! De Lawd , now!\"\n\nIf, all these years later, the tensions between the visions of Martin and Malcolm have endured in the black community, it can sometimes appear that Malcolm's flat, blank anger has carried the day-and not merely in a certain style of attitude, as evidenced by the swagger and bluster of many rap artists. How Malcolm's presence far more deeply lingers among us was illuminated by the recent upheavals in Los Angeles, after the acquittal of the policemen tried for the beating of Rodney King. But if the lasting racial alienations in America would seem to put King's high moral proposition in doubt, the irony is that at the time Malcolm was slain he had begun to move away from the fierce, implacable persona to which his mystique and his children have now fastened. He had broken with the Black Muslims, and in the last year of his life he had been venturing, however tentatively and unevenly, beyond the insular racial delirium of their doctrine and was approaching a more open and conciliatory vision-a vision closer, if still only in certain nuances, to King's own. James H. Cone, in his recent book \"Martin & Malcolm & America,\" writes that \"they complemented and corrected each other.\" Malcolm, in fact, was killed in the midst of a kind of metamorphosis. Just three days before his death, he confessed to a reporter, \"I'm man enough to tell you that I can't put my finger on exactly what my philosophy is now.\" Charles Kenyatta, one of his followers at the time, recently told me, \"All this hype now, they're trying to give the false image that Malcolm had come to be the Saviour of black people. But he didn't know himself who he was.\" In the end, he was groping, alone, for some different purpose, some different self-definition. Indeed, at no point in his life could Malcolm cease struggling, as if by dim but resistless instinct, for more light.\n\nAs Malcolm tells it in the \"Autobiography,\" he was born into rage and despair, in the spring of 1925, in Omaha. His mother, Louise Little, was from Grenada-a lithe, erect woman of somewhat finely strung nerves, whose own mother, Malcolm claimed, had been raped by a white man, and who was herself pale enough to be taken for white. His father, by contrast, was an oil-black roisterous colossus of a man, named Earl Little-a one-eyed construction laborer and part-time Baptist preacher from Reynolds, Georgia, who had struck out on his own after finishing either the third or the fourth grade. A brooding, disappointed man, full of turbulence, he had become a disciple of Marcus Garvey, who, in flamboyant plumed uniforms with gold braid,was Harlem's aspiring black-nationalist Moses in the early years of the century. Garvey was imprisoned for mail fraud the year Malcolm was born.\n\nFrom prison, Garvey had promised his believers, \"I shall come back to you. . . . Look for me in the whirlwind or the storm, look for me all around you.\" Earl took young Malcolm to fevered meetings of Garvey's faithful, where such messages were regularly invoked. Because of Earl's devotion to Garvey, according to a somewhat melodramatic account of Malcolm's, Klan night riders with torches swept down on the family's house in Omaha shortly before he was born. Certainly, as Malcolm later liked to cast it, white harassment had pursued Earl Little in his migratory struggle to scrap out a living for his family; he moved them briefly to Milwaukee, then to Lansing, Michigan, where their home was burned-by white racists, Malcolm would claim. Earl Little finally moved his family to a rural plot two miles out of East Lansing.\n\nThere, in a drab and wintry countryside, in a tar-shingle house of only four rooms, each with a single naked light bulb dangling over a rugless board floor, Malcolm passed his boyhood-a shabby and cheerless one, utterly unlike King's. His autobiography contains almost no mention of holidays like Christmas and Thanksgiving. His father ruled the family with frequent beatings, exempting only Malcolm, the fourth of seven children. Earl was particularly interested by his wife's scruples about diet: she disdained pork and rabbit. Once, Malcolm related to Haley, his father took a rabbit from the pen outside and ripped its head off with \"one twist of his big black hands,\" then flung the body at his wife's feet, ordering her to cook it, and stormed out of the house. It was the last time any of them saw him alive. Late that night, police brought word that he had been found, mangled and dying, beside some streetcar tracks, where he had apparently fallen under the wheels. Malcolm was then six years old. He later insisted that his father's death had also been the work of white racist vigilantes.\n\nIf Earl was gentler with Malcolm than with his other children, Malcolm surmised in his autobiography, it was because \"he was subconsciously so afflicted with the white man's brainwashing of Negroes that he inclined to favor the light ones, and I was his lightest child.\" Of a brassy hue-\"bright,\" it was sometimes called-he seemed tortured by the whiteness in him. He later told his followers, of the man he claimed had raped his mother's mother, \"Yes, that raping, red-headed devil was my grandfather! That close, yes! My mother's father! . . . If I could drain away his blood that pollutes my body, and pollutes my complexion, I'd do it! Because I hate every drop of the rapist's blood that's in me.\" There were moments, Malcolm said, when that most intimate of helpless outrages to his person left him \"so choked up\" that he would stalk the streets, solitary, late into the night.\n\nAfter his father's death, his mother struggled on in a Depression poverty so stark that sometimes she had nothing to feed her family except stale surplus bread and boiled dandelion greens, and the children would be \"dizzy\" with hunger. Malcolm, at school, would huddle off by himself to eat a wild-leek sandwich. Before long, the remnants of the family began to disintegrate. \"Some kind of psychological deterioration began to eat away our pride,\" Malcolm later said. At the age of nine, he began pilfering from stores in town. And his mother, sitting alone in a rocking chair chattering to herself with all window shades drawn, began to drift into insanity. The Christmas of Malcolm's thirteenth year, according to Bruce Perry's \"Malcolm,\" a formidably researched biography that appeared in 1991, his mother was found wandering barefoot along a snow-dappled road, dirty and unkempt and clutching a baby, her eighth, this one illegitimate. Shortly afterward, she was delivered into a state mental hospital. Her children were scattered about as wards of the state, and Malcolm was briefly in a detention home.\n\nSuch hurt does not readily permit the inward grace for any sort of transcendent understanding like King's. Its only gift is, perhaps, a certain icy unsentimentality, a terrible bleak clarity of consciousness. At any rate, Malcolm never forgave white society for what had happened to him. By that time, he had reached the seventh grade, and was a tall, gawky youth, preternaturally bright and quick, but he was resentful even of being elected class president by his white fellow-students: as he told Haley, \"I was unique in my class, like a pink poodle.\" Not unaware that he held a special promise, he speculated to his English teacher that he might like to become a lawyer; the teacher advised him, amiably, \"You've got to be realistic about being a nigger. . . . Why don't you plan on carpentry?\" Withdrawing into a sullen and wordless isolation, he dropped out of school after finishing eighth grade and went to live with a half sister in Boston's Roxbury section.\n\nThere he swiftly moved into a night world of black bars and pool halls and dance halls, where, he recounted in his autobiography, \"I met chicks who were fine as May wine, and cats who were hip to all happenings.\" He conked his hair to a sleek russet straightness with a scalp-scorching compound of lye, eggs, potatoes, Vaseline, and soap, and arrayed himself in billowy zoot suits of Crayola colors, with a long gold chain looped at the waist, a rakish wide-brimmed hat, orange bulb-toed shoes, and a pint flask in his inside coat pocket. He became something of a sensation on the ballroom floors for his abandon in dancing the Lindy. Before long, he was peddling dope, shooting craps, playing the numbers. After a time, he began keeping conspicuous company with a blond white woman, who regularly made expeditions to Roxbury's dance halls. He was then still in his mid-teens.\n\nHe managed to get a job as an attendant on Pullman trains between Boston and New York, and wound up staying in Harlem, which was, he remembered in his autobiography, \"like some technicolor bazaar. . . . This world was where I belonged.\" There, as he recounted it, he became one of the snazziest of hustlers. He was called Red, or sometimes, because he came from Michigan, Detroit Red. Running numbers, steering men to prostitutes, selling dope, using dope. He carried automatics now, which he would flourish in random stickups.\n\nBefore long, sensing that the police and, more important, a gambling enforcer were closing in on him in Harlem, he returned to Boston, and set up a small burglary ring, enlisting the white woman there whom he was still dating, and her sister, to scout promising residences from their base, a rented apartment in Harvard Square. \"Sometimes the victims were in their beds asleep,\" the \"Autobiography\" tells us. \"In stockinged feet, we'd go right into the bedrooms. Moving swiftly, like shadows, we would lift clothes, watches, wallets, handbags, and jewelry boxes.\" It was as if he were exacting from all white society his own form of reparations. But a certain lunging recklessness had set in to his operations by now. It was only a matter of time before he was apprehended. And in February of 1946 he began serving an eight-to-ten-year sentence for burglary. He was not quite twenty-one.\n\nConfined in Charlestown's Dickensian prison, whose closet-size cells had no plumbing, he kept himself in a constant rage, he told Haley, coming to be called Satan by his fellow-inmates, and spent much of his time pacing \"like a caged leopard,\" railing aloud to himself. He had, he later reflected, \"sunk to the very bottom of the American white man's society.\" And it was there that the Nation of Islam found him.\n\nIt came through the intercession of Malcolm's brothers and one of his sisters, who, in visits and letters to him in prison, told him they had converted to a faith they called the \"natural religion for the black man.\" Its creed was that the white man was, quite literally, the devil-a pale, blue-eyed race genetically predisposed to a systematic devastation of \"every race of man not white.\" It was an illumination that Malcolm compared to that of Paul on the road to Damascus-a blazing revelation that it was whites who had visited on him all the mortifications and torments of his past. He was so overcome by this discovery that, he recounted in the \"Autobiography,\" he resolved to spend the rest of his life informing white people about their true natures, and he began by scrawling letters to the mayor of Boston, the governor of Massachusetts, and President Truman.\n\nIn that enterprise, he came to realize that he had lost to the streets what little schooling he'd had: \"I didn't know a verb from a house.\" He began studying ferociously, copying out with a pencil on a blue-lined school writing tablet every word in the prison dictionary. He had taken a correspondence course in English, even one in Latin. In his cell at night, in the glow of the corridor light, he read digests of world history by H. G. Wells and Will Durant. He read commentaries on Herodotus and Socrates, and he read Schopenhauer, Kant, and Nietzsche, volumes on linguistics and etymology. He later told Haley, \"I didn't know what I was doing, but just by instinct I liked books with intellectual vitamins.\" In this prodigious exertion, he acquired the con's kind of enormous but eclectic, unproportioned learning.\n\nThis isometric amassment of scholarship was marked, particularly in its racial obsession, by odd gaps. In later life, he informed his audiences that blacks had been mistaken about their true enemies ever since they were brought captive to Jamestown \"in the year 1555.\" In a 1958 newspaper article (included in Clayborne Carson's \"Malcolm X: The FBI File\"), he referred to \"this Jesus who preached in Palestine, which is on the Arabian Peninsula.\" He once explained to Haley that Homer was among the Moors-\"Homer and Omar and Moor , you see, are related terms\"-who had been abducted from Africa by Europeans, blinded so they couldn't return, and forced to \"sing about the Europeans' glorious accomplishments.\" He argued that Shakespeare's plays were written by King James I, the same King James \"who poetically 'fixed' the Bible-which in itself and its present King James version has enslaved the world.\"\n\nAll this came to be mixed in with the Nation of Islam's racial theological history, which Malcolm earnestly subscribed to until almost the last year of his life. It was a kind of intellectual \"Fantasia\" that rivalled, in its fabulous loopiness, the racial anthropology of \"Mein Kampf.\" Original humankind was black, appearing about seventy trillion years ago. A sublime civilization, which founded the city of Mecca, and even exercised dominion over Mars, it was presided over by twenty-four wizards, or \"wise scientists,\" who created the animals and made the mountains, and even \"deported\" the moon from the earth. One of the wizards, a malcontent named Mr. Yacub, born about sixty-six hundred years ago and known as the \"big-head scientist,\" because he had an oversized cranium, learned how to breed races scientifically. When, for his seditious agitation, he was exiled from Mecca to the Isle of Patmos-later famed for the Book of Revelation-he contrived as revenge, Malcolm explained, a means of creating a \"bleached-out white race of devils.\" Mr. Yacub knew that black men contained two germs, black and brown, the lighter being the weaker. Through an eight-hundred-year process of genocidal culling-by means of needles inserted into the brains of unsuitably darker infants-that progressed from the black race to a brown, a red, and then a yellow race, the project at last produced a blond, pale-skinned, blue-eyed devil race, which wound up in the caves of Europe. In time, Malcolm reported, Moses was chosen by Allah to \"civilize\" these devils, the first with whom he succeeded being the Jews. But all the pallid devil race eventually gained ascendancy, through \"tricknology,\" and finally seized into slavery a portion of the Original People, the tribe of Shabazz, who had been led into Africa fifty thousand years earlier to harden and toughen them for their predestined ordeal.\n\nThis entire historical panorama had been disclosed, in Detroit, in 1931, to the future Messenger of the Lost-Found Nation of Islam in the Wilderness of North America, Elijah Muhammad-then still Robert Poole, a slight young migrant from rural Georgia, with only a fourth-grade schooling. The source of the revelation was an enigmatic figure known as Mr. Fard, a small, beige man who was a peddler of silks and yard goods. Mr. Fard, whose real name, according to Bruce Perry, was Wallace Dodd Ford, described himself generally as a \"brother\" from the East, but at one point he confided to Robert Poole that he was \"the Mahdi.\" In any case, after setting up the new Islamic sect in Detroit, he mysteriously disappeared. Some adherents believed he had returned to Mecca; others suspected he had been disposed of by the disciple into whose hands leadership of his little religion fell: Robert Poole, now calling himself Elijah Muhammad.\n\nIn 1952, after serving about six and a half years of his sentence, Malcolm was released on parole. He emerged from prison with his hair shorn close to his skull, in the Muslim fashion, and with only a ten-dollar suit; on his first day of freedom, he bought a new pair of eyeglasses, a wristwatch, and a suitcase. He passed more or less directly from prison into the community of the Nation of Islam, which must have seemed to him, after the ferocities of his life up to that point, like arriving in a paradise of calm and order.\n\nIts leader might have appeared, at first glance, a somewhat improbable mighty messenger of Allah. An elfin man of a delicate amber hue-a fragile bronchial asthmatic-Elijah had a peculiar daintiness of manner, with prim tightenings of the mouth, and he was usually dressed in a dull black suit with a black rubber-shiny bow tie and, on his head, a pillbox cap twinkling with a scimitar moon and radiant orbs and stars. But behind his wistful little demure smiles there lurked an unmistakable wiliness, and a cool deadliness of purpose: he reigned, after all, as the source and center of the Muslims' radioactive field of racial menace. Nevertheless, his message of a black Islamic elect of righteousness had effected wonders of regeneration among numerous souls lost, like Malcolm, in the spiritual desolation of America's ghettos. For his part, Malcolm would insist up to his end that he \"believed in Mr. Muhammad more than [Mr. Muhammad] believed in himself.\" His slave name of Little was now replaced by a symbol for his long-lost and unknown African family name: he became Malcolm X.\n\nOwing to his own rapt, consuming intensity, Malcolm was soon inducted into the Muslim ministry, and he was ultimately anointed by Elijah Muhammad to serve as a kind of peripatetic national missionary for the Muslims. Under his unflagging evangelism, the Nation of Islam swiftly expanded from a baroque and tiny variant of Islam, confined to about four hundred faithful who gathered mostly in storefront mosques, into, by 1960, a truly national congregation, of perhaps ten thousand registered followers, with some forty temples and missions spread across the country and a network of more than thirty radio stations. It formed a separate interior culture, with its own school system, its own economic complex of shops and service businesses, and its own religious militia of solemn, dark-suited centurion guards, called the Fruit of Islam.\n\nIn Harlem alone, where Malcolm now presided over the Nation's major mosque, he was addressing street rallies of fifteen thousand for up to four hours. One of his converts from the early years, Benjamin Karim, recalls, \"He held me spellbound. Listening to him, I began to understand how empty I was. And he put in me, in place of that emptiness, knowledge. And out of that came self-discovery, and pride.\" Malcolm moved ebulliently along Harlem's teeming sidewalks, a rangily tall, overcoated figure, talking with everybody-one of Harlem's own now returned, purged, to prophesy to his people. There was, indeed, with his glinting eyeglasses, a certain priestly quality about him. He lived modestly, in a succession of residences in Queens (they were provided him by the Muslims), drove a blue Oldsmobile, and dressed in staid funeral-director suits, with a tie clip of a leaping sailfish, and unfailingly polished plain black shoes. He was scrupulously-almost fanatically-punctual, and ceaselessly entered notations with a red ballpoint pen in a red pocket notepad. He had about him a tightly machined self-containment. His only betrayal of excitement or anger, at some moment of confrontation, was a rosy tinge rising, under his brassy hue, from neck to face. \"I was with him for seven or eight years,\" Karim, who became one of Malcolm's assistant ministers, told me. \"I was as close as anybody could get to him without burning up. But It was impossible to really know him. Nobody could really get close to him.\" When one of Malcolm's brothers-the very one who had first introduced him to Islam in prison-later defected from the faith and then lapsed, like his mother, into insanity, Malcolm commented, with a strangely chill detachment, that \"it was meant, for Reginald to be used for one purpose only: as a bait, as a minnow to reach into the ocean of blackness where I was, to save me.\"\n\nIndeed, he could take on at times the grimness of a Torquemada. He fervently observed the Muslim strictures against not only the common carnal vagaries like fornication but also dating, dancing, smoking, drinking, movies, gambling, sports, and eating more than one meal a day. He usually slept just four hours a night. About the only indulgences he allowed himself were coffee and, late at night, tea. He permitted himself to watch only newscasts on television. There was a fastidious priggishness about him. He abstained from profanity and also from slang, once reproving Alex Haley for referring to children as \"kids\": \"Kids are goats! \"\n\nHe was yet more forbidding when it came to the daughters of Eve. \"All women, by their nature, are fragile and weak: they are attracted to the male in whom they see strength,\" he declared in the \"Autobiography.\" Moreover, \"you never can fully trust any woman. . . . Whatever else a woman is, I don't care who the woman is, it starts with her being vain.\" Karim remembers that Malcolm would admonish women about how to dress, telling them, \"If you walking down the street with a piece of fresh meat in your hand, you can't blame a dog for snatching the meat. If you exposing meat, you either selling it or giving it away.\" At the same time, though, he would assure the women in his audiences that \"the black man never will get anybody's respect until he first learns . . . to shelter and protect and respect his black women!\"\n\nFor that matter, Malcolm kept himself an ascetic bachelor until, in 1956, he began to notice in the congregation at his mosque in Harlem a tall, dark-brown young woman named Betty Sanders. Born in Detroit, she had been an education major at Tuskegee Institute, in Alabama, and was now studying nursing at a New York hospital. She had not yet converted to Islam, but what struck her about Malcolm, she told me recently, was \"his intensity.\" She said, \"I thought, You can't play with this guy-he's serious.\" He also had what she calls \"a high civility,\" and, she recalls, \"When he used this high civility, a lot of girls took it to mean that he was interested in them. I was not going to be one of those fickle-hearted little females.\" She carefully maintained a sober tone in their first encounters, at a nearby restaurant. \"However, there came a time when I thought\"-and here she gave a girlish flip at the back of her hair with her hand-\"I was on to something.\" When she indicated that she might do a lot of partying after graduating from nursing school, Malcolm reacted with an instant, visible alarm. When she eventually introduced him to her parents, who were Methodists, he struck them as \"a marvellous young man-clean-cut, and he knows so much,\" but when she asked them if they would like him as a son-in-law \"it was a little different,\" she says. In fact, they were horrified by the possibility that he might take her, their only child, away from them forever into the mysterious and alien world of the Muslims. Just over a year later, after Betty's conversion, and in accordance with a carefully and gravely deliberated arrangement sanctioned by Mr. Muhammad, they were married. Malcolm was then thirty-two. Betty's parents became estranged from her, and reconciled themselves to Malcolm only after she began bearing his children. \"They finally accepted his 'difference,' \" she says.\n\nBut marriage hardly mellowed the fury of Malcolm's obsessive pentecostalisms against America's devil rule: that mission had become the total meaning of his life. According to F.B.I. files, he declared, with an air of celebration, \"We, the black men of the world, created the white man and we will also kill him. . . . Only in this way can there be peace on the earth.\" He named his first daughter Attilah, he later explained, for the Hun who \"sacked Rome.\"\n\nWith the narrowed stare of his eyes giving Malcolm himself a vaguely Tatar aspect, he took on, for many whites, a sulfurous malevolence. Indeed, it does no service, either to the reality of Malcolm or to history, to try to moderate in memory the racial vituperativeness of his oratory then. \"We don't want to integrate with that ole pale thing!\" he would cry to black audiences, light flashing blankly off his glasses. \"The dog is their closest relative. They got the same kind of hair, the same kind of skin, and the same kind of smell . Oh, yeaaah! \"\n\nIt was a racial invective that was only an inverse, in fact, of that to be heard whinnying from the flatbed loudspeakers at any cow-pasture Klan rally of the time. Malcolm insisted this was only reflexive to four hundred years of white racism, but it captured him in the same cramped, bleak mentality, which placed a racial construction on all life. Malcolm readily professed that he shared the Southern whites' aversion to integration, as a sure prelude to miscegenation. As he declared, integrationists \"want your wife and your daughter and your sister and-and your mother .\"\n\nIt is not, then, quite so bizarre as it might first seem that one night in 1961 Malcolm held a clandestine meeting with Klan chieftains in Atlanta to solicit their support for the Muslim ambition to establish a separate country within the United States. He told the assembled Klansmen that the Muslims were as deeply committed to segregation as they were, and, according to an F.B.I. report, assured them that \"the Jew is behind the integration movement, using the Negro as a tool.\"\n\nTwo years earlier, he had pronounced the Jews \"one of the worst of the devils,\" claiming, \"He does more to take advantage of the so-called black people than any other and yet poses as being a friend.\" He averred at one rally, Peter Goldman reports, that \"everybody talks about the six million Jews. But I was reading a book the other day that showed that one hundred million of us were kidnapped and brought to this country- one hundred million . Now everybody's wet-eyed over a handful of Jews who brought it on themselves.\"\n\nIn general, his fulminations seemed to carry an unappeasable malignance, which impossibly outraged white sensibilities. He declared that because of the genetically determined iniquity of all whites, in any race war it would be imperative to slay even their children. In 1962, not long after seven unarmed Muslims were shot, one of them fatally, in an altercation with the Los Angeles police, it happened that at Orly Airport, near Paris, a chartered jet bearing many of Atlanta's cultural élite crashed during takeoff. \"I would like to announce a very beautiful thing that has happened,\" Malcolm told a Muslim rally in Los Angeles, according to the F.B.I. \"As you know, we have been praying to Allah. . . . And I got a wire from God today.\" Allah \"really had answered our prayers . . . in one whop,\" he went on. \"He dropped an airplane out of the sky with over one hundred and twenty white people on it.\" And \"we will continue to pray and we hope that every day another plane falls out of the sky.\" He could be just as pitiless about the deaths of white civil-rights workers. Goldman reports that when a white minister perished under the tracks of a bulldozer during a demonstration at a construction site in Cleveland, Malcolm told an audience in New York, \"What he did-good, good, great. What he did-good. Hooray, hooray, hooray. . . . It's time some white people started dying in this thing.\"\n\nIn all, Malcolm was still operating from his old, street hustler's cynicisms. He contemplated the gathering civil-rights struggle, and its leaders, with the deepest disdain. The whole appeal for integration seemed to him craven, a spectacle of the abused who, out of some perverse compulsion, were \"trying to unite\" with their abusers. All that the movement was achieving anyway, as in Birmingham, was \"promises that they will be able to sit down and drink some coffee with some crackers in a cracker restaurant,\" as an F.B.I. report quoted him. \"Now, what kind of advancement is that. They still don't have a job.\" He particularly deplored the principle of nonviolence. \"I believe it's a crime for anyone who is being brutalized to continue to accept that brutality without doing something to defend himself,\" he told Haley. \"If that's how 'Christian' philosophy is interpreted, if that's what Gandhian philosophy teaches, well, then, I will call them criminal philosophies.\" He held a special contempt for King. Charles Kenyatta, who is now a Baptist minister in Harlem, remembers that, in private, \"Malcolm had always said, when he met King, he was gonna hit him in the jaw and see just how nonviolent he really was.\"\n\nAlthough, as some have pointed out, Malcolm never directly urged in public the initiation of any specific act of outright violence, his oratory fairly reeled with exultant anticipation of an impending racial Armageddon, some \"maximum retaliation against racist oppressors\" in a \"racial conflict . . . that could easily escalate into a violent, worldwide, bloody race war.\" Kenyatta recalls, \"I thought, the way Malcolm was talking, just had to be some unhidden guns and armies somewhere. He preached once, 'Anybody lays a hand on you when you go out of here, think five times.' And I told him, 'You done brought me all the way up here ready to kill somebody, what you mean 'Wait five times'?\"\n\nKing, for his part, in an interview with Playboy did not conceal his misgivings about Malcolm's \"demagogic oratory,\" saying of Malcolm's \"litany of articulating the despair of the Negro without offering any positive, creative alternative\" that he felt that \"Malcolm has done himself and our people a great disservice.\" It was as if they were talking two different languages. While King refused to engage Malcolm in any open confrontation, he did occasionally indicate privately that he might like to have a conversation with him at some point. In fact, they encountered each other only once, and only glancingly-when both happened to be in the corridors of the Capitol during the debate on the 1964 civil-rights bill. Malcolm pounced to King's side. They exchanged amenities and briefly clasped hands, King's smile faint and tentative, Malcolm's a wide grin, in a flaring of flashbulbs. But that was it. They quickly parted and returned to their separate realms.\n\nWhen Malcolm's startling separation from the Nation of Islam came about, in late 1963, the pretext initially given was that Elijah Muhammad had been dismayed by remarks of Malcolm's about the assassination of President Kennedy. Kennedy's slaying was \"the chickens coming home to roost,\" Malcolm had said, and it made him \"glad.\" He maintained that he had in mind, among other things, Kennedy's allowing the death, in a coup, of South Vietnam's dictator Ngo Dinh Diem. At the headquarters of the Nation of Islam, in Chicago, the day after he made these remarks, he was told by Elijah Muhammad, \"That was a very bad statement. . . . I'll have to silence you for the next ninety days-so that the Muslims everywhere can be disassociated from the blunder.\" Malcolm initially submitted to this discipline, but he later asserted in his autobiography, \"I hadn't hustled in the streets for years for nothing. I knew when I was being set up.\"\n\nCharles Kenyatta, who was given the name Charles 37X, recalls, \"Malcolm had become the money-maker. He had taken them out of the wilderness and brought them into the Promised Land, where all of a sudden they were being looked on as a very powerful organization.\" But tensions had been developing for some time, among those around Messenger Muhammad, over Malcolm's growing national conspicuousness. To be sure, Malcolm did seem to have become fascinated by his reflection in the media, white devils' instrument or no. He would willingly sit for three-hour interviews with the press. While he grumbled in the \"Autobiography\" that the media had \"somehow\" managed to filch his home phone number, he had actually slipped it to journalists himself. Kenyatta later lamented to Goldman that the media's bright mirror \"really destroyed him,\" and went on to say, \"He got drunk off it. He used to sit by the TV set and watch himself, and you could see how much he liked it.\" Increasingly, in the national eye, Malcolm himself became the Muslims. He had first attracted the attention of the F.B.I. in 1953, when it was informed that he might be a Communist sympathizer. But what sustained the Bureau's continued surveillance was a curiosity about him as an exotic racial incendiary. In any case, according to one F.B.I. undercover report, Elijah Muhammad finally complained to Malcolm that he had been constantly \"hearing about MALCOLM this and MALCOLM that and even MALCOLM being called leader.\" Malcolm must never forget that he was \" ELIJAH'S property.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Malcolm, as his engagement with the world around him expanded, had been growing restive within the confines of the Black Muslims' righteous ghetto, the isolation of its millennial racial mythos. Despite all his berating of the civil-rights movement, he found himself increasingly stirred by the spectacle it presented, as the most powerful mass drama then unfolding in the black community. As many blacks saw it, he said, \"Muslims talk tough, but they never do anything.\"\n\nBut there was more to his restiveness than that. Elijah Muhammad, he had heard earlier in 1963, had engaged in dalliances with a succession of young secretaries, and some of them were pregnant or had already borne what members of Muhammad's court delicately referred to as \"divine babies.\" This news left Malcolm profoundly stunned. \"I had discovered Muslims had been betrayed by Elijah Muhammad himself,\" he told Haley, and he described its effect on him in almost Shakespearean terms: \"I felt as though something in nature had failed, like the sun, or the stars.\"\n\nWhen word of Malcolm's reaction got back to the Muslims' inner councils, he was called to a session with Elijah Muhammad, beside the swimming pool of Muhammad's home in Phoenix, which had been acquired for him out of solicitude for his bronchial disorder. An implausibly frail and wheezy gnome to have disported himself so briskly with teen-age nymphs, Elijah explained that these activities had been an exercise Biblically imposed upon him. \"You recognize that's what all of this is-prophecy,\" he said, according to Malcolm. \"I'm David. When you read about how David took another man's wife, I'm that David. You read about Noah, who got drunk-that's me. You read about Lot, who went and laid up with his own daughters. I have to fulfill all of those things.\" Charles 37X was with Malcolm at this last session with Elijah Muhammad. \"The old man told Malcolm\"-at this point, Kenyatta stood and wagged his forefinger-\" 'Son, go back and put that fire out. Or my followers are gonna hurt you.' But Malcolm had too much pride to do that.\"\n\nMalcolm still viewed a final excision from the Muslim faithful with considerable reluctance and trepidation, however, and for some months he kept up a kind of furtive scrimmaging to ease himself back into a family whose elders had already effectively disowned him. Yet, at the same time, he began industriously distributing word of the Messenger's indecorous frolickings to others within the Nation of Islam, among them the future Louis Farrakhan, a natty and bright-eyed former calypso singer who was then presiding over the Boston mosque. He, along with others, relayed the tidings of Malcolm's betrayal back to Chicago. Then Malcolm, in escalating desperation, disclosed the matter publicly. Journalists hesitated to run the story at first, because of libel considerations. (One reporter told him, though, according to an F.B.I. wiretap, that he \"wished to God he could print the bit about the divine babies.\") Finally, Malcolm managed to persuade three of Muhammad's former secretaries to furnish affidavits, and two of them to file paternity suits.\n\nIn due time, Malcolm received a telegram from a captain of the Fruit of Islam in Chicago, stating, \"Mr. Malcolm: We hereby officially warn you that the Nation of Islam shall no longer tolerate your scandalizing the name of our leader and teacher the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.\" A few months earlier, an F.B.I. wiretap had picked up a call to Malcolm's home by an unidentified person who instructed the woman who answered, \"Just tell him he is as good as dead.\" Malcolm himself was confident that someone in the Muslim ranks would \"take it upon himself to kill me as a 'religious duty,' \" as he put it to Haley. But, he declared, what to him was worse than death \"was the betrayal.\" Even at that point, \"I could conceive death. I couldn't conceive betrayal.\" Indeed, when it became plain that he was now permanently cast out from the Muslims' midst, he wept.\n\nThe previous spring, perhaps not coincidentally, Malcolm set out alone on a pilgrimage to Mecca, and afterward he claimed to have discovered that the Black Muslim racial dogma had all along been an eccentric aberration, and no part of true, classical Islamic theology. At the airport in Cairo, among a multitude of other pilgrims headed for Mecca, he removed his Western apparel and wrapped his waist and shoulders in two white cloths, his long rusty-skinned legs now extending bare and ostrichlike below, and he had shoved his large feet into sandals. On the flight to Jedda, he told Haley, he was awed to find the plane crammed with \"white, black, brown, red, and yellow people, blue eyes and blond hair, and my kinky red hair-all together, brothers.\" On the verge, as it were, of a second release from a captivity-this one a release he had never anticipated-he was filled with exhilaration to note that \"the whole atmosphere was of warmth and friendliness.\" He said, \"The feeling hit me that there really wasn't any color problem here.\" Upon reaching Mecca, he found himself eating \"from the same plate . . . with fellow Muslims, whose eyes were the bluest of blue, whose hair was the blondest of blond, and whose skin was the whitest of white.\" In all his life, he said afterward, it was \"the first time I had ever stood before the Creator of All and felt like a complete human being.\"\n\nHis wonder and elation over such commonplace cordialities somehow hinted at the childlike simplicity-innocence, even-that had lurked all along under the ferocities of his racial exhortations back in America. Exorbitant or not, this euphoria-\"Why, the men acted as if they were brothers of mine!\"-now prompted in him, he declared, \"the start of a radical alteration in my whole outlook about 'white' men.\" If there seemed an oddly poignant naïveté in his jubilation, a part of that naïveté was also a capacity for belief so instant and total, as the actor Ossie Davis would tell Peter Goldman, that \"when he saw something, he embraced it. . . . It was wow! a truth! and he grabbed it.\"\n\nHe returned to New York-with a scanty goatee, and wearing an Astrakhan hat-no longer the Malcolm X of his Black Muslim years but with a new name, honoring his completion of the pilgrimage: he was now El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz. He held a press conference at Kennedy Airport-a pandemonious convocation-at which he announced his enlightenment and his transformation. \"In the past, yes, I have made sweeping indictments of all white people,\" he said, but, after what he had experienced in Mecca, \"I never will be guilty of that again,\" and he added, \"A blanket indictment of all white people is as wrong as when whites make blanket indictments against blacks.\"\n\nOver the following months, it did seem that he had moved significantly beyond his old simple racial fixations toward what he described in his autobiography as \"a new insight\": that \"the white man is not inherently evil, but America's racist society influences him to act evilly.\" And it was less a matter of economics than a \"historical neurotic pathology-the abiding and almost limitlessly complex permeation of society by the legacy of slavery, a \"political, economic, and social atmosphere .\" His mission now was \"to help create a society in which there could exist honest white-black brotherhood,\" and in which \"both races, as human beings, had the obligation, the responsibility, of helping to correct America's human problem\" and, ultimately, \"to change this miserable condition that exists on this earth.\"\n\nIt is easy to make a bit too much of this development in Malcolm: it was, at most, only the beginning of a transmutation. He never became able, for instance, to accept the ethic of nonviolence; in fact, in the very press conference in which he proclaimed his new racial illumination he had also recommended that blacks form rifle clubs and otherwise arm themselves in case of attack. Neither had he lost his essential mistrust of the whole concept of integration. Even in Mecca, he contended in the \"Autobiography,\" there was \"a color pattern to the huge crowds. . . . I saw that people who looked alike drew together and most of the time stayed together.\" More dismally, there continued to gutter in him the old, acrimonious suspicions that \"so many Jews actually were hypocrites.\" As for whites: \"Let sincere whites go and teach nonviolence to white people!\"\n\nBut now, in his striving to free himself from other thralls in his past, he found that, in contrast to his almost immediate and total new birth in prison, he had to develop and define this regeneration extemporaneously and on his own. Peter Goldman, in a recent conversation, spoke of Malcolm at that time as being in \"a period of explosive and chaotic growth, re-creating himself on the run.\" Benjamin Karim, his longtime associate, whose own memoir is shortly to be published, said that at the time he \"saw a person who was trying to remake himself into another image, one that was not racially inclined-not to like or dislike a person according to his race. Committed to brotherhood , you know. Some of the people with him-because of ignorance, he had to deal with them about that.\" Malcolm even went so far as to propose what once, when he was a Black Muslim, would have been heresy-that blacks might use the vote to achieve political power. But he had wandered into a kind of thematic no man's land, caught between the simple clear rancors of his past and his still unformed mission for a more hopeful future. Charles Kenyatta says he cautioned Malcolm, \"You can't tamper with another person's God if you don't have another to give them.\" Karim, who left the Muslims with Malcolm, says, \"He had to shift into another gear he didn't know about. He never found that gear. He never came into focus. And that was right down to the last day.\" Malcolm had lost the simple certitude that is vital for any leader, and he was balked on every side: the civil-rights movement rejected him as too militant, and the militants discounted him as too moderate. He once blurted to Haley, \"They won't let me turn the corner! I'm caught in a trap!\"\n\nNow that he was outside the society of the Muslims, he found that, for the first time since emerging from prison, he no longer had any real place. He improvised two organizations of his own-Muslim Mosque, Inc., and a more secular operation, which he called the Organization of Afro-American Unity. A good two years before the widely heard calls for \"black power\" and the eventual, now commonplace invocations of \"community control,\" he called for a form of black nationalism that was his own variation on the Muslims' concept of self-contained black neighborhoods, taking their own economies and politics into their own hands. Beyond that, he sought to develop an active bond between the black society in America and the Mother Continent-a sort of Pan-African black Zionism promising a massive liberation of spirit for America's black minority as it identified with the world's overwhelming dark majority. In turn, he exhorted African nations to call the United States to account before the United Nations, for the oppression of its black population-as they had called South Africa to account in November of 1961, in the wake of the Sharpeville massacre. This was all an inspiration that had evolved from two journeys he made through Africa in the months following his pilgrimage to Mecca. To him, those journeys had seemed the ultimate spiritual homecoming, a return at last to the lost Eden of the Old Country. In those visits, as he forged about, looped in cameras and ceaselessly, greedily taking pictures, he was welcomed by governments there with much pomp and celebration, as if he were a visiting ex-officio head of state.\n\nAt the same time, though, some Africans were a bit disconcerted by the pallor of his skin, and assumed he was an albino. He tended to be considered more an American than an African. Most of all, the African governments he had entreated to indict the United States before the United Nations later proved singularly reluctant to oblige him, and thereby jeopardize the considerable American aid they were receiving.\n\nIn a sense, then, in moving beyond the Muslims-\"the only group that really cares about you,\" he had been taught-Malcolm found that he had moved into a kind of void. Benjamin Karim remembers that at the time \"he was living on the edge. Before that, he had everything set up for him. Now he had to do it on his own. For the first time, he became very edgy, very sensitive.\" What was particularly painful, Malcolm was repudiated by Muhammad Ali, whom he had tutored in the Muslim faith over a period of three years, while Ali was still Cassius Clay. In the first days of Malcolm's suspension by Elijah Muhammad from public speaking, Ali had invited him and his family down to his training camp in Miami Beach before his heavyweight title fight with Sonny Liston-a kindness for which Malcolm remained passionately grateful. But at the time of Malcolm's final, open break with the Muslims, Ali told Haley, \"You just don't buck Mr. Muhammad and get away with it. I don't want to talk about him no more.\" When their paths happened to cross in Africa, Malcolm addressed Ali as \"Brother,\" but Ali, according to an F.B.I. report, remarked to his entourage afterward, \"Man, did you get a look at him? Dressed in that funny white robe and wearing a beard and walking with a cane that looked like a prophet's stick? Man, he's gone so far out he's out completely. . . . Nobody listens to that Malcolm anymore.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the high pageantry of the civil-rights movement continued to sweep past, oblivious of him. He became, in fact, a familiar figure looming tall and alone at the margins of its rallies and demonstrations, again thickly hung with cameras and earnestly taking pictures of the proceedings. \"He wanted so much to come on in, to be a part of it,\" Kenyatta remembers. \"He had always this dream to belong.\" From abroad, he had directed an aide to write letters to leaders of the movement, offering his hope that his \"new position\" might be \"attractive to you.\" Back home, he made blurting attempts to reach out to them more directly. Once, when I was covering King's campaign in St. Augustine, Florida, in which his marchers were undergoing Walpurgis Nights of Klan mayhem, I learned that Malcolm had sent a telegram to King, assuring him that, on his word, \"we will immediately dispatch some of our brothers there to organize our people into self defense units . . . and the Ku Klux Klan will receive a taste of its own medicine.\" King's reaction to this overture was, as I recall it, one of appalled dismay.\n\nWhile King was in jail during the Selma demonstrations, Malcolm was invited by Snick partisans, for their own mischievous designs, to address a mass meeting in a Selma church. Malcolm wound up seated on the podium beside Coretta Scott King. At one point, he leaned close and whispered to her-with what seemed an apologetic and wistful urgency, Coretta later recalled-\"to let Martin know he was not causing trouble or making it difficult, but that he was trying to make it easier,\" that he simply wanted to confront whites with \"an alternative\" to King's appeal. In his address, he made no equivocation about his own aversion to nonviolence but pointed out that whites \"better be glad Martin Luther King is rallying the people because other forces are waiting to take over if he fails.\"\n\nBut his past would not turn him loose. He began to see everywhere, he said, on the streets and in elevators and in passing cars, \"the faces of Muslims whom I knew, and I knew that any of them might be waiting for the opportunity to try and put a bullet into me.\" Of this period Kenyatta remembers, \"We were on the move, one place to another, trying to dodge the bullets.\" Malcolm was also floundering financially, sustaining himself on loans and lecture fees and the less than imposing collections at his services, and finally, toward the end, on advances on his autobiography. Furthermore, a court had found for a claim by the Muslims that they were the legal owners of a house in East Elmhurst, Queens, occupied by Malcolm and his family-a house, Betty Shabazz still insists, that had been given to her by Elijah Muhammad himself as a wedding gift. And there now drew close the harrowing near-certainty that Malcolm, his pregnant wife, and their four daughters would be evicted from their home.\n\nMalcolm had often claimed that his earliest memory was of waking up, when he was four, amid the flames and chaos of the fire at his home in Lansing and of his father shooting at two white men fleeing into the night. Now, some thirty-five years later, he found himself on the eve of a virtually inevitable court denial, in a Monday-morning hearing, of his last appeal to prevent the Muslims from flushing him and his family out of their home and repossessing it. And in the black early-morning hours of that Sunday there was a boom and a glare of flames around the house, and once again he was standing amid his family, in pajamas, with children crying, out in the yard, watching his home burn. Dawn showed that about half of it was scorched and spottily charred, from two fires-one that had exploded in the front parlor, the other at a back window.\n\nIn a service at the Audubon Ballroom, in Harlem, two evenings later, Malcolm declared, \"My house was bombed by the Muslims! . . . I wouldn't care for myself if they would not harm my family!\" However, it is not readily apparent why members of the Nation of Islam, whatever their general balefulness, might have wished to terrorize Malcolm out of the house by burning it, on the eve of the almost certain affirmation of an eviction order that they had already obtained. \"We own this place, man,\" a Muslim chieftain protested. \"We have money tied up here.\" The Nation of Islam asserted that the fire had been Malcolm's own handiwork-what might seem a manifestly absurd suggestion, since his four small daughters were sleeping in the house at the time.\n\nNevertheless, close scrutiny of some of the evidence does make it appear at least a peculiar affair. An F.B.I. summary of police and Fire Department reports states that while Betty told the firemen that she had been the first to awaken and had roused Malcolm, he stated that he awoke himself and discovered the fire. According to the summary, the only alarms came from two chance witnesses, a neighbor and a passing taxi-driver, who heard the window glass shatter but saw no one outside the house either in front or in back. Shortly after the fire was extinguished, investigators found the neck of a whiskey bottle containing a scorched cloth wick in the back yard, about fifteen feet from a broken bedroom window with a scorched venetian blind. Oddly, though, as Bruce Perry noted in \"Malcolm,\" the window glass had scattered only into the yard, not into the room, and a fan pattern of burned weeds suggested that the bottle had actually been thrown from inside the house. A whiskey bottle containing a small amount of gasoline was found on the unburned front porch, which led firemen to suspect that gasoline from the bottle had been first splashed around the parlor and set afire, and the bottle left broken on the porch. Even more suspicious, the summary reported that \"a quart whiskey bottle filled with gasoline was located standing upright on the dresser\" in a rear bedroom, and that \"this bottle had a screw cap which was intact and did not have rags attached to it.\" Malcolm afterward attested that it was his wife who had first called the firemen's attention to the bottle. And, according to Perry, when a fireman picked up the bottle it left a clear circle amid the soot from the fire which had settled on the dresser top-evidence that the bottle had been set there before the fire. After stories appeared about the discovery of this gasoline-filled bottle, Malcolm maintained that it had been planted in the house, and postulated a conspiracy between the police, the Fire Department, the press, and the Black Muslims. The question is how the police or the firemen could have deposited in the room precisely the same sort of bottle that had been used to fire the house. It seems inescapable that the hand that set the bottle on the dresser was the one that had poured the contents of the others about the house and flung them out the windows. The difficulty with such a conclusion, of course, is that it assumes that Malcolm would knowingly put his children at risk.\n\nMalcolm's mood at the time had become one of cornered frenzy. He told Haley that when he concluded that Elijah Muhammad had sanctioned his extermination \"my head felt like it was bleeding inside.\" Some of the people close to him began to fear that he was approaching a psychic shattering. He seemed given more and more to a kind of blindly barging, barely contained berserkness, in which his resorting to such a personal scorched-earth recourse would not be wholly inconceivable-allowing him then to call down on the Muslims the vengeance at least of a public outrage and condemnation. As he declared afterward, \"I'm waking up America to the great Muslim menace.\"\n\nMoreover, Bruce Perry has discovered that the Lansing fire that traumatized Malcolm as a child-the fire he had always avowed to be the work of white racists-may have been set by his father, who, Perry found, had also faced eviction, and was briefly jailed for arson: a two-gallon oilcan that had contained kerosene was found under a bedspring in the basement; Earl Little had purchased kerosene only hours before the fire. Both the Lansing fire and the East Elmhurst fire occurred at 2:30 A.M. ,and during the days following the East Elmhurst fire rumor had it that Malcolm's wife appeared visibly enraged at him. When I asked her about the fire recently, she said, \"I'm not gonna talk about all that now.\"\n\nThe week after the fire was the last week of Malcolm's life. His protégé Louis Farrakhan had announced in a Muslim newspaper, with the scorpion vigor for which he later became more widely noted, \"The die is set, and Malcolm shall not escape. . . . Such a man as Malcolm is worthy of death.\" The Chicago elect, Goldman reports, issued a tape-recorded statement, to be played for other temple memberships, that Malcolm was due to be \"blasted clear off the face of the earth.\" Malcolm said that in the Nation of Islam \"any death-talk for me could have been approved of-if not actually initiated-by only one man.\" What confronted him now was like the most primal of dreads-that the man who had been his soul's true father wanted to kill him. Kenyatta recalls that, even after all that had happened, Malcolm \"missed the old man more than the old man missed him. He was so close to a breakdown that he wanted death, that's how close he was.\" Malcolm declared, \"Black men are watching every move I make, awaiting their chance to kill me. . . . Anyone who chooses not to believe what I am saying doesn't know the Muslims in the Nation of Islam.\" He seemed to move sluggishly, fitfully, in a trance of doom. \"Each day I live as if I am already dead,\" he told Haley, and kept assuring others, \"I'm a dead man.\" And the irony of this inevitability did not escape him: that the Muslim faithful could be trusted to deliver on their threats \"because I taught them myself.\" It was as if he were ambushed from the past by his own hand. In the end, for all Malcolm's apostleship of wrath over the years, the only violence his message ever demonstrably precipitated was upon himself.\n\nThe Audubon Ballroom in Harlem was on the second floor of a building with an arcing roof that looked from outside like an airplane hangar or a civic gymnasium. A frumpish, musty relic from the dance-hall years of Malcolm's past, it had been converted into an auditorium for his post-Nation of Islam ministry, with folding chairs for a congregation of four hundred. On the mild afternoon of Sunday, February 21, 1965, it was filled with a wan wintry light.\n\nAs had become Malcolm's policy, despite the miasma of threats surrounding him now, those entering the ballroom were not searched at the door. Moreover, the New York City Police, who had provided a twenty-man uniformed guard detail, were asked to post all but two of them outside. Charles Kenyatta was standing in the back of the ballroom and noticed the absence of police. \"I said to two or three of the brothers, 'What is this? What's goin' on?' They said, 'This is the way he wanted it, didn't want any security.' He had come to long to die. That's the reason he pulled those guards. Seemed he was just asking for it. I told him, 'We can't keep on goin' like this. Got to be some fightin' back. You lost your street knowledge.' But Malcolm said, 'You have lost your faith in Allah.' Thing was, Malcolm felt under a stroke of fate.\" Kenyatta paused for a moment, and continued, \"Listen, he was lonely. That's why he wanted to die. He wanted to be a martyr. He knew.\"\n\nEarlier that morning, in his room, at the midtown Hilton, where he had stayed overnight, Malcolm put on a dark-brown suit over, despite the unusual balminess of that February day, long-john underwear. He talked to Betty on the phone, telling her not to come to the rally. But before leaving he called her back, saying that he did want her there. Malcolm had also asked several community notables and ministers, and also the Ossie Davises and Martin Luther King's attorney, to join him on the platform for the afternoon's service, but when he arrived at the Audubon he learned that none of them would be coming. In a small anteroom offstage, he barked sharply at a young woman there, an O.A.A.U. assistant, and then, according to Haley, a little before going out to speak he apologized to her, saying, \"I'm just about at my wit's end.\"\n\nBenjamin Karim was chosen to introduce him. As they waited in the anteroom, Karim recalls, \"it was absolutely weird. Standing there looking at him, I felt he really couldn't go any further. But he had come to a point where he still couldn't see his goal. I didn't know he was going to be assassinated, but it was like looking at a man who had been physically lifting logs, and had lifted the last log he could lift. The burden had become too much. He was very drawn. He looked like he had already begun moving out of life.\"\n\nAppearing on the platform to an explosion of cheering and applause-that familiar tall and gangling figure, his face wrapped in one of his spacious grins-he waited for silence, and then offered the Islamic greeting \" As-salaam alaikum , brothers and sisters,\" and the audience chorused in turn, \" Wa-alaikum salaam .\" At that instant, about eight rows back in the crowd below him, a man leaped to his feet crying, \"Get your hand out of my pocket!\" As heads turned and Malcolm's security guards at the foot of the platform began moving toward the distraction, Malcolm lifted both arms and called, \"Hold it! Hold it! Don't get excited. Let's cool it, brothers.\" But now a man was scrambling toward him, hunched forward over a long glint of metal. And, with Malcolm's arms still lifted in that becalming gesture, a shotgun blast blew him backward with a perfectly circular seven-inch pattern of holes over his heart. He toppled, with blood spattered across his face and shirt, down through two empty chairs to the platform, his head hitting with a loud thunk, and the shotgun, a sawed-off double-barrel twelve-gauge, blasted him again where he lay. Now two other men, in overcoats, at the foot of the platform, were clattering away at him with pistols-a 9-millimetre and a .45 automatic. \"It looked like a firing squad,\" one witness recalled. Betty, sitting near the stage with her daughters, saw the original disturbance out of the side of her vision, and when she heard the shots, she says, she had an instant certainty: \"I knew there was no one else in there they'd be shooting at.\" She turned to see Malcolm falling, and immediately threw the children under some chairs and covered them with her body. \"They never actually saw it, what had happened,\" she says.\n\nThe auditorium had become a storm of howling people floundering for cover in a tumble of chairs, some of which were flung through the air as two of the gunmen fled for the door. In a continuing clangor of gunfire, some of it now from Malcolm's guards, the two gunmen made it down the stairway to the street, but there one of them, who had been shot in the leg, was overhauled by the crowd, and came close to being beaten to death before he was claimed by hastily arriving police.\n\nMeanwhile, back inside the ballroom, Betty, crying, \"They're killing my husband!,\" attempted to rush forward to where Malcolm lay. \"I wanted to give him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but a person was holding me back,\" she says. A stretcher was finally brought from a nearby hospital, and Malcolm was borne away, his face fixed, in death, in a fierce grimace of bared teeth-almost as if he had been at last reclaimed by the old, irreconcilable rage of the Malcolm X who had been pursuing him all these many months.\n\nToday, recalling that Sunday afternoon at the Audubon Ballroom, Betty Shabazz says, \"I still carry it with me all the time. I prayed for years for it to be taken away, not to be able to remember it.\" She had even refused to take the children to the funeral, for fear \"they'd see him there prone, not moving.\" She says, \"But my consciousness expanded, so I can live with it.\" In fact, she has become, like Coretta King, the public keeper of her husband's memory. (According to her, it was Malcolm who suggested to Haley that he look into his ancestors' past in Africa-a suggestion that led to \"Roots.\")\n\nAfter Malcolm's death, Betty earned a doctoral degree in education, and she is now an administrator at Medgar Evers College, in Brooklyn. She is an imposing dowager of a woman, with a round, full face that has a stately impassiveness. During a recent conversation, she began by declaring, with a forefinger spearing upward, much in Malcolm's old preacherly manner, \"To understand Malcolm, you must understand his mission\"-which she is now constantly explaining to audiences across the country. \"He's called a racist-no, no, no! Sometimes you have to exaggerate in order to get people to see. What did he do? He held up a mirror. Sometimes you don't like what you see in a mirror.\" She added, quietly, \"When he's away, he's here. I still feel his presence. He still lives with me. The guy was so strong .\"\n\nNot long after Malcolm's death, Elijah Muhammad consented to receive the press-even those members with blue eyes and chalky skins-in a vast chamber of his mansion in Chicago. Tiny and solemn amid walls hung with white silk, he declared, in a fluting voice, \"We have not, as I said, never resorted to no such thing as violence. Way I see it, Malcolm is the victim of his own preachin'. He preached violence, and so he becomes a victim of it.\" But Peter Goldman reports that to a gathering of his believers four days later he said, between coughings and wheezings, \"He tried to make war against me. . . . It's wrong to even stand beside the grave of a hypocrite. . . . Malcolm got what he was preaching.\" Two of Malcolm's brothers were presented, to denounce him one last time as \"a man who was no good.\"\n\nThree black men-all Muslims, as it eventually proved-were arrested, and in a two-month trial nearly a year later were found guilty of the slaying and sentenced to life in prison. Two of them are now out on parole. The third, Talmadge Hayer, who was the gunman apprehended immediately outside the ballroom, confessed at the trial but declared that the two others had not been involved. They have continued to maintain that they had nothing to do with the shooting. In prison, Hayer admitted to Goldman that Malcolm's execution had been plotted by five Muslim street regulars, under the inspiration of the Muslim leadership, as retribution for the discomfort that Malcolm had afforded Elijah Muhammad. The message in comments heard by the faithful from some of Muhammad's close courtiers, such as \"If you knew what Malcolm said about the Dear Holy Apostle, you'd kill him yourself,\" was as unmistakable as Henry II's legendary complaint about Thomas Becket.\n\nNorman Butler is one of those convicted of Malcolm's murder who still denies he participated in it, but he nevertheless told Goldman that, beforehand, \"security people rolled in from everywhere-captains from all over the country. . . . And New York was made to look bad,\" and he quoted one of them as saying, \"What we got to do-bring in people from all over to take care of your business?\" These words came, Butler said, from a member of Elijah Muhammad's own household in Chicago, who elaborated, \"Cut the nigger's tongue out and put it in an envelope and send it to me, and I'll stamp it approved and give it to the Messenger.\" Butler told Goldman, \"And that, at that time, was death . Back then, that was an order .\" It was not as if defectors and apostates from the Nation of Islam hadn't been killed before, and for considerably tamer affronts than Malcolm's. Charles Kenyatta says today, \"They were nothing but a Mafia operation.\" As Elijah Muhammad's somewhat more benign son, Wallace, was later appalled to discover, at least ten believers who were simply restless about the overbearing manner of the Fruit of Islam had also been killed. All those who investigated Malcolm's assassination were convinced that, beyond the three convicted, at least one person and possibly three more people were involved.\n\nOther speculations have since swarmed: suspicions-invigorated by subsequent disclosures about police operations against other perceived menaces, like the Black Panthers-that swiftly turned into certainties about complicity by the C.I.A., the F.B.I., the New York police, or all the engines of the state combined, choreographed from Washington, and including a possible betrayal by one or several of Malcolm's own. Malcolm's film biographer, Spike Lee, has written, \"We all live in a wicked country where the government can and will do anything to keep people in check. . . . I see the F.B.I., C.I.A. and the police departments around this country as one and the same. They are all in cahoots and along with the Nation of Islam, they all played a part in the assassination of Malcolm X. Who else? King? Both Kennedys? Evers?\" It testifies to a curious superstition about the omniscience of federal agencies to maintain, as Lee does, that \"the Bureau knew Malcolm's every move, knew he was being hunted down, but stood back.\"\n\nIn reality, Malcolm was warned by the F.B.I. of threats against his life, and was assured that the F.B.I. would supply witnesses if he wished to take the Muslims to court. And he was repeatedly offered protection by New York's police. One was a formal offer of a twenty-four-hour police guard, and he had received as many as seventeen offers to station uniformed officers at his rallies at the Audubon Ballroom-offers made, to be sure, with the anticipation that Malcolm would almost certainly refuse them, as he mostly did. The only probable complicity of the F.B.I. and the police in what happened would have been that, knowing a strike at Malcolm to be almost certainly impending, they chose not to intervene any more actively to avert it.\n\nThe case for some larger official conspiracy to execute Malcolm proceeds from the supposition that at that time he presented a serious concern to the custodians of the national interest, both internally and abroad. Evidence cited for such a conspiracy includes the claim that, during a journey of Malcolm's to Cairo to try to persuade the African Unity Organization to take America's racial policy before the United Nations, he was, while staying at the Nile Hilton, \"poisoned.\" But, having partaken of the fare of Cairo, including that of the Nile Hilton, on several visits of my own there, I can say that I have been poisoned on at least two occasions myself. The truth is, the notion that the national authorities had become so hoodooed by Malcolm that they would actually engage in a plot to eliminate him rather exaggerates the perception of his threat at the time. Though he did eventually attract more interest from the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. with his transmutation from a Black Muslim isolationist into a militant advocate of a Pan-African black nationalism, that interest never seems to have ranged much further than his potential for embarrassment. What unease about black militancy had gathered in government agencies was focussed principally on King, with his incomparably larger following. Malcolm's true danger to the nation's management-that he was creating a radical new consciousness of pride and assertiveness in the nation's black community-was a phenomenon still inherently beyond the institutional imagination.\n\nTo be sure, Malcolm himself once said to Haley, \"The more I keep thinking about this thing, the things that have been happening lately, I'm not all that sure it's the Muslims. I know what they can do, and what they can't, and they can't do some of the stuff recently going on.\" Nevertheless, his expectation of assassination was fixed, for the most part, on the Muslims alone. One Muslim operation to exterminate him, he reported afterward, went awry only when one of the participants had second thoughts and came to warn him.\n\nIn the end, much of the speculation about a conspiracy arises, as in the case of Kennedy's death, from a reluctance to accept the absurd disparity that so much could have been destroyed through any circumstance so paltry and mundane. In Malcolm's case, an obscure internal religious war on the fringes of the black community seems impossibly out of proportion to his life and its meaning now. But one should always be wary of explanations that are far more arabesque and fantastical in detail than the paradoxes they're trying to explain.\n\nIn the years after Malcolm's assassination, and Elijah Muhammad's serene expiration, in 1975, Elijah's son, Wallace, diverged with some Muslims into a far milder and more conventional version of Islam, in the process quietly discarding his father's claim to have been Allah's Messenger. He even began restoring Malcolm as a venerated figure of the faith, and eventually renamed the Harlem mosque in Malcolm's honor. (There has also survived a straighter line of doctrinal descent, from Elijah Muhammad to Louis Farrakhan, who now occupies Elijah's mansion in Chicago.)\n\nBut beyond the singular personal testament of his autobiography, Malcolm, to all appearances, left little behind him that was measurable. Both of his organizations had already fallen into ramshackle disarray, on the verge of dwindling away altogether. His grand Pan-African political offensive had evaporated against the cold calculations prevailing at the United Nations. He remained little more than a kind of garish rogue figure on the edge of the ongoing surge of the civil-rights movement. But Malcolm's true epitaph has turned out to be much like a fulfillment of that old invocation of his father's great hero, Marcus Garvey: \"I shall come back to you. . . . Look for me in the whirlwind or the storm, look for me all around you.\"\n\nShortly after his death, as the civil-rights movement shifted to the urban North, speculations arose that Malcolm would become an increasingly formidable figure in the black consciousness and that King would be forced to adapt to Malcolm's message. The suggestion, though, that Martin and Malcolm were actually converging, in their widening campaigns against poverty and the dehumanization of American policies, seems ultimately illusory: they held two profoundly different understandings of humankind. King was animated by a vision of how things could and should be; Malcolm operated within a flat, rancorous acceptance of things as they were. \"This is an era of hypocrisy,\" he declaimed. \"You pretend that you're my brother and I pretend that I really believe you believe you're my brother.\"\n\nBut the duality between their visions is an abiding one, reaching beyond both Martin and Malcolm, and it has become, if anything, even more pertinent in what seems now yet another quickening of America's old racial travail. Specifically, the government's-and the society's-bland obliviousness of the plight of the poor in the last decade seems only to have placed more pressure on the racial fault line in the national community. Beyond that, there are those who have even proposed that racial turmoil may well be the coming theme of international history, as the world contracts into an ever more intimate neighborhood: that ethnic or tribal conflicts like those today in the remnants of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, in Sri Lanka and Somalia, to say nothing of the Middle East, will replace the long historical kinetic force of state nationalism and ideology and economic contention-that the real conflicts that will occupy governments and their armies will be as primitive a matter as the clashings of races.\n\nIn this country, at least, the implications of the increasing bitter estrangement of the children of Malcolm (in his latter days he noted, \"Thicker each year in these ghettos is the kind of teen-ager that I was\") can be nothing less than a deepening dissolution of the old dream of a common, egalitarian American neighborhood. To an extent, Malcolm incontestably emancipated a form of black pride: he himself claimed, with considerable fairness, that he had acted \"to revolutionize the American black man's thinking, opening his eyes until he would never again look in the same fearful, worshipful way at the white man.\" Jesse Jackson, who as a college student once drove from North Carolina to Harlem hoping to meet with Malcolm, remembers that \"he was able to cut down the enemy with his tongue-that was his excitement for black people. Martin's liberation was his public movement, opening up the system to blacks. But Malcolm's was personal-he somehow removed the fear in blacks' personal encounters with whites.\" Ossie Davis proclaimed in his eulogy at Malcolm's funeral, \"Malcolm was our manhood, our living, black manhood . . . Our own black shining prince!\" He is still hailed by many as the most authentic voice of America's vast black underclass. In this he was actually ahead of King. Virtually by his oratory alone, he helped call forth the dawning of black consciousness in America; a cultural decolonization of the black spirit.\n\nBut it has been his earlier incarnation to which his posterity has somehow clung: to Malcolm's own slayer, in effect. On book covers, and on posters that have proliferated throughout the black community-in university black-student unions and inner-city bookstores-it is the image of Malcolm during his Muslim days that glares out, in his old finger-spearing racial judgment and malediction; it is, as the myriad profusion of \"X\"s shows, still Malcolm from his Nation of Islam years. For that matter, most of Malcolm's children may now have only a dim impression of him, as a fearsome black orator who was once the nemesis of white America.\n\nIt was his own hope, he told Haley, that \"one day, history may even say that my voice-which disturbed the white man's smugness, and his arrogance, and his complacency-that my voice helped save America from a grave, possibly even a fatal catastrophe.\" But the true tragedy of Malcolm's life would be if, along with his inner emancipation of blacks, his gift to his people should also become, from that grimmer evangelism which finally claimed him in the Audubon Ballroom, the lurid liberation of their anger in the moral nihilism most recently beheld in the firestorm of Los Angeles. The rage after the acquittals of the Los Angeles police officers who had been seen on video systematically beating Rodney King was much in the spirit of the old Malcolm X. It is a matter of some irony, then, that Rodney King himself, around whom the rage of the children of Malcolm had billowed, turned out to be consummately one of the children of Martin when he appeared before cameras and, pained and stunned, ventured the appeal, in a halting, stumbling voice that yet had an eloquence beyond all the roaring of those days, \"Can we all get along?\"\n\nIt was toward that simple but ultimately civilized sentiment that Malcolm was making his last pilgrimage. He undertook it against fearful odds-odds that, after all these years, still confront his people. For the rest of us, then, the parable of Malcolm X should serve as an urgent warning. We must at last come by the recognition, the conscience, and the will to somehow make it possible for Malcolm's children-the still dispossessed descendants of America's aboriginal crime of slavery-to continue the journey that he began. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Columbia's Overdue Apology to Langston Hughes\n\nPublished in the print edition of the December 30, 1967 , issue.\n\nOn a miserably wet evening seven months after the death of Langston Hughes, we sat, almost comfortably (except for our damp feet), in the cavernous Wollman Auditorium, at Columbia University, and listened to the low, bemused voice of Hughes on tape as, against a taped musical background, it sent his \"Weary Blues\" floating over a group of people who had assembled to pay tribute to him. The program, \"A Langston Hughes Memorial Evening,\" was sponsored by The Forum, which is, in the words of its nineteen-year-old president, Bruce Kanze, \"a student organization that brings to the University interesting people whom the University itself would never consider bringing, to discuss issues and topics that are important.\"\n\nA few minutes after eight, when nearly every seat was filled, three men walked onto the stage: Leon Bibb, the actor and singer; Jonathan Kozol, author of \"Death at an Early Age\"; and Professor James P. Shenton, of Columbia. (\"He teaches a course on Reconstruction-the closest thing to a course on Negro history at Columbia,\" Mr. Kanze told us later.) They were soon joined by Miss Viveca Lindfors, the actress, who was wearing a pale-gray fur coat but removed it as she was sitting down, and gracefully placed it over her mini-exposed knees.\n\nProfessor Shenton, who had to leave early, was introduced, and hurried to the microphone. \"I am here partly as a way of saying for Columbia that we owe some apologies,\" he said solemnly. \"For a while, there lived a poet down the street from Columbia, and Columbia never took the time to find out what he was about.\" The Professor paused for a few seconds, and then continued, \"For a while, there lived a poet down the street from Columbia, who even attended Columbia for a while, and yet he never received an honorary degree from here. When we buried him, then we gave him a memorial. But, after all, that's the experience of the black man down the street from Columbia.\"\n\nProfessor Shenton left the platform, and Mr. Kozol, a slim young man wearing rimless glasses, came to the microphone. In 1965, he was discharged from a ghetto school in Boston, in part because he read Langston Hughes' poem \"Ballad of the Landlord\" to his class:\n\nLandlord, landlord, My roof has sprung a leak. Don't you 'member I told you about it Way last week?\n\nLandlord, landlord, These steps is broken down. When you come up yourself It's a wonder you don't fall down.\n\nTen bucks you say I owe you? Ten bucks you say is due? Well, that's ten bucks more'n I'll pay you Till you fix this house up new.\n\nWhat? You gonna get eviction orders? You gonna cut off my heat? You gonna take my furniture and Throw it in the street?\n\nUm-huh! You talking high and mighty. Talk on-till you get through. You ain't gonna be able to say a word If I land my fist on you.\n\nPolice! Police! Come and get this man! He's trying to ruin the government and overturn the land!\n\nCopper's whistle! Patrol bell! Arrest.\n\nPrecinct station. Iron cell. Headlines in press:\n\nMAN THREATENS LANDLORD TENANT HELD NO BAIL JUDGE GIVES NEGRO 90 DAYS IN COUNTY JAIL\n\nMr. Kozol said that he might have avoided some of the trouble that eventually led to his firing if he had chosen to \"restrict his reading and reference materials to the list of approved publications\"-poetry, for instance, to be read from officially approved selections called \"Memory Gems.\" He gave the Hughes audience a sample:\n\n\"Dare to be right! Dare to be true: The failings of others can never save you. Stand by your conscience, your honor, your faith; Stand like a hero, and battle till death.\"\n\nAnd another:\n\n\"There is beauty in the sunshine An' clouds that roam the sky; There is beauty in the Heavens, An' the stars that shine on high.\"\n\nLater, Mr. Kozol read from a paper that had been handed in by one of his fourth-grade students after he had asked the class to write about the kinds of things they saw around them:\n\n\"In my school I see dirty boards and I see papers on the floor. I see an old browken window with a sign on it saying, Do not unlock this window are browken. And I see cracks in the walls and I see old books with ink poured all over them and I see old painting hanging on the walls. I see old alfurbet letter hanging on one nail on the wall. I see a dirty fire exit, I see a old closet with supplys for the class. I see pigons flying all over the school. I see old freght trains throgh the fence of the school yard. . . .\"\n\nThe young teacher spoke at length about his experiences in this school, and then read a few paragraphs from a description of Africa in a book called \"Our Neighbors Near and Far\":\n\n\"Yumbu and Minko are a black boy and a black girl who live in this jungle village. Their skins are of so dark a brown color that they look almost black. Their noses are large and flat. Their lips are thick. Their eyes are black and shining, and their hair is so curly that it seems like wool. They are Negroes and they belong to the black race.\"\n\nTwo children in another area of the world were described this way:\n\n\"Two Swiss children live in a farmhouse on the edge of town. . . . These children are handsome. Their eyes are blue. Their hair is golden yellow. Their white skins are clear, and their cheeks are as red as ripe, red apples.\"\n\nMr. Kozol said that he had never met Langston Hughes but that a short while after his much publicized firing he had received a new collection of Hughes' \"Simple\" stories from the poet, with these words written on the flyleaf: \"I wish the rent / Was heaven sent.\"\n\nLeon Bibb, in his turn, rose and thanked Mr. Hughes, whom he called Lang, first by reading the James Weldon Johnson poem \"O Black and Unknown Bards\" and then by giving a poignant rendering of Mr. Hughes' poem \"The Negro Speaks of Rivers\" and the spiritual \"I've Been 'Buked and I've Been Scorned.\" He wound up by saying, \"Lang had the foresight to stand on his own words.\"\n\nSoon Hughes' own words were being read by Miss Lindfors, who remained seated, and whose Swedish accent was lost in translation as she read from \"The Panther and the Lash,\" a recent Hughes collection, brought out by Knopf. She read about the \"Junior Addict\":\n\n\". . . Yes. easier to get dope than to get a job- daytime or nighttime job, teen-age, pre-draft, pre-lifetime job.\n\n\"Quick, sunrise, come! Sunrise out of Africa, Quick, come! Sunrise, please come! Come! Come!\"\n\nAnd she read about the \"Dream Deferred.\" And she read \"Impasse\":\n\n\"I could tell you, If I wanted to, What makes me What I am.\n\n\"But I don't Really want to- And you don't Give a damn.\"\n\nMiss Lindfors also read the poem whose first line is \"That Justice is a blind goddess\" and the poem about \"Birmingham Sunday\"-September 15, 1963, when four little Negro girls were killed in Sunday school by a bomb thrown from outside the church. Miss Lindfors read several more poems-some bitterly humorous ones, and the one that asks, \"What color / Is the face / Of war?,\" and one called \"Peace,\" and, finally, \"Down Where I Am\":\n\n\"Too many years Beatin' at the door- I done beat my Both fists sore.\n\n\"Too many years Tryin' to get up there- Done broke my ankles down, Got nowhere.\n\n\"Too many years Climbin' that hill, 'Bout out of breath. I got my fill.\n\n\"I'm gonna plant my feet On solid ground. If you want to see me, Come down .\"\n\nThe memorial to Langston Hughes ended as it had begun, with Langston Hughes' low, bemused voice-this time telling about how he came from the Midwest to Columbia to go to school, and caused great consternation when he presented himself at Hartley Hall. That was in 1921, and no one of African descent, he says, had ever lived in a dormitory at Columbia. \"There are many barriers people try to break down,\" he told an audience (which had also been a Columbia audience) when the tape was made, in 1964. \"I try to do it with poetry.\" ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "Pour One Out for Tyler Perry's Madea\n\nCreators, with their special hubris, are at constant risk of being swallowed by the act of creation; they give their inventions fabulous power and, in the process, lose control of them. Has any contemporary commercial artist learned this lesson quite like Tyler Perry? His most famous character, the brusque grandmother Madea, packs an assault rifle and a Glock. She pulls the pistol out of her purse as effortlessly as sane old ladies produce those awful strawberry bonbons. In nearly a dozen stage plays, and in as many movies, Madea has taken aim at no-good freeloaders and goody-goody authorities, all while spreading a hard-headed traditionalism herself. But no one has stared down the barrel of her cultural menace more often than Perry himself. Since 1999, when he first débuted Madea, in the theatre piece \"I Can Do Bad All By Myself,\" Perry has played his own matriarch, wearing a gray press-and-curl wig and a muumuu and covering his six-foot-five frame with a stuffed suit. Perry is Madea, but, in a sense, it's Madea who owns Perry.\n\nHe's thought about killing her for at least a decade. For one thing, the suit is heavy and the makeup is smothering. Now he's about to turn fifty, and has a child and a girlfriend offscreen; he will probably one day be Hollywood's first black male billionaire. As a dramatic actor, in thrillers like \"Alex Cross,\" and \"Gone Girl,\" Perry is capable of barrel-chested valor (though it would have been nearly impossible for anyone to summon gravitas as Colin Powell in Adam McKay's \"Vice,\" given the hollow script, and the fact that Perry's chin quiver calls to mind Madea's neck roll did him no extra favors).\n\nPerry did nearly \"off\" Madea once,  in \"Boo 2! A Madea Halloween,\" a couple of years ago, but, like a zombie or like Jesus, whom she so merrily misquotes, she rose again. \"It's time for me to kill that old bitch,\" Perry told the radio host Bevy Smith, last fall. \"A Madea Family Funeral,\" which was released earlier this month, is, according to Perry, the last Madea movie. Even so, he couldn't bring himself to fully destroy his creation. On the movie's poster, she lounges on a coffin that belongs to someone else, praise hands up.\n\nThe torment of Perry's mommy drag is charmingly Freudian. In his Madea films, Perry also plays a lawyerly version of himself, named Brian, a nephew of Madea's who, with terrorized obedience, chauffeurs her around town after a judge suspends her license. Perry has explained that he based Madea, in part, on his own aunts and his beloved mother, who raised her son with a moral stringency that countered the moral deficiency of his father, who was abusive. (After his mother's death, Perry learned that she had lied to him, and that his biological father was someone else.) Set the autobiographical inspiration aside, though, and you'll notice that Madea bears little resemblance to older black women in the real world. She smokes weed, curses, and spits. She self-identifies as a thug. She could steal your man and your wallet. Her religiosity is unorthodox-she interprets the Bible's \"Peace, be still,\" to refer to the \"piece o' steel\" she keeps in her purse. Her Southern accent-\"Hallelujer!\" \"Praise da Lort!\" \"Hellur!\"-is not one found in nature.\n\nMabel (Madea) Simmons is a laugh-track mommie dearest, a vulgar mammy whose charges aren't wet white babies but wayward black young adults. She hails from a dubious performance tradition that started in minstrel theatres, in the nineteenth century, and, since the nineteen-eighties, has been floridly revived by black male comedians doing intra-racial pseudo-drag. The difference between Perry's Madea and Martin Lawrence's Big Momma or Eddie Murphy's Anna Klump is that Madea plays the role of the pragmatic moralist in Perry's cosmos; the Madea movies are mouthy morality plays for the entertainment of black women. Perry's secondary female characters are either professionally and romantically insecure, falling for dark-skinned mogul-tyrants, as in \"Diary of a Mad Black Woman,\" or they're too stubborn to submit to hard-working, light-skinned brothers, as in \"Madea's Family Reunion.\" Madea presides over the domestic turmoil of her various nieces, neighbors, and foster daughters, pinching their ears and swatting their behinds until all the family trauma is exorcised and replaced with strong-willed common sense. Cicely Tyson or Maya Angelou might even make a cameo, to firm up the feeling of ancestral dignity.\n\nPerry's movies and television shows are formulaic and clichéd, yet they have achieved enormous success. White critics don't like them, but their reviews are polite pans, not referendums on Perry's soul. (As Hilton Als wrote, in a New Yorker piece on Perry in 2010 , \"No white critic wants to tell a black man what he can or cannot say about his own society.\") For black critics, more is at stake. For years, the reaction was uniform hostility toward Perry's embrace of melodrama and stereotype. In 2009, Spike Lee called Perry's sitcoms \"Meet the Browns\" and \"House of Payne\" \"coonery and buffoonery.\" In a profile of Perry for New York magazine, in 2015, Rembert Browne wrote that the negative feelings toward the director \"aren't about his business sense, his ability to direct, or his acting chops-typically, they're about him as a net loss for the black race.\"\n\nOver time, though, the wholesale critical rejection of Perry has softened into a begrudging acceptance, and perhaps even a cringing love. When \"Boo! A Madea Halloween\" came out, I received texts from friends, their tones hesitant, asking if we should go see it. \"I did not expect to enjoy this show,\" Browne wrote, of seeing a production of \"Madea on the Run.\" \"But, after a few minutes, I slipped up and laughed.\" I laugh at Perry movies a lot, too. When I was a kid, my mother would buy bootlegs of his plays and films by the pack, from a kindly hawker who would come by the salon where she got her hair done. Back then, my critical faculties were barely developed, and I hadn't yet learned to distrust that which primitively pleased me. Movies were not mirrors. I hadn't yet come to understand that there is a ghastly aura surrounding the activity of black consumption, shading the outré with a pallor of paranoia and pain.\n\nAt the time Spike Lee made his comments, Perry responded by accusing the auteur of bourgie condescension. \"Spike Lee can go straight to hell,\" he said, at a press conference for \"Madea's Big Happy Family.\" Then he grew grandiose: \"Booker T. Washington and W. E. B. DuBois went through the exact same thing. Langston Hughes said that Zora Neale Hurston, the woman who wrote 'Their Eyes Were Watching God,' was a new version of the 'darkie' because she spoke in a Southern dialect and a Southern tone. And I'm sick of it from us; we don't have to worry about anybody else trying to destroy us and take shots, because we do it to ourselves.\" Perry had clearly lost all sense of proportion; \"Madea Goes to Jail\" is not as rich a text as Hurston's \"How it Feels to Be Colored Me.\" (Although Perry's artistic intent feels more guileless than chauvinistic, I'm not thrilled by the idea of girls watching his films without debriefs.) But I think that black women who are entertained by Perry, from his initial audience of churchgoers to younger, secular crowds, are not deriving their sense of personal esteem from his sermons. Lee later admitted just as much; in an interview with Oprah, who has long been a business partner and advocate of Perry's, Lee said that he thought he might work with Perry one day. Perry's pure eschewal of white opinion, and his Trojan-horsing of black talent, is admirable. While white Hollywood was underselling the skills of Lynn Whitfield, Viola Davis, Taraji P. Henson, and Gabrielle Union, Perry was giving these performers platforms. Madea is stupid, but her stupidity is comfortably numbing, an anesthetic injected into the part of my brain that demands the impossible of black women onscreen.\n\nTo mark her retirement, Perry is taking Madea on a countrywide farewell stage tour. Beyoncé and Jay-Z went to one of the performances. I can't, in good conscience, recommend \"A Madea Family Funeral\" or subject it to the pressure of critical analysis. The plot is that Madea and her posse of horny senior citizens (including Perry as Madea's brother Joe and a wheelchair-bound war veteran named Heathrow) walk in on a commotion in a hotel room. On the day of his wedding anniversary, a relative of Madea's had scheduled a tryst with his dominatrix mistress, and then lost consciousness during the act. The sight of leather-bound breasts, Joe suggests, has stunned him into a heart attack; the creepy mortician demonstrates to the family that the corpse's lingering erection prevents the casket from staying shut. In typical Perry fashion, Madea, who guards the infidelity from the widow, says one wise thing: \"Folk get mad at you when you tell them something about they husband.\" The widow, in a teary sequence, reveals that her husband emotionally abused her, and that she's happy that he's dead. Then she toodle-loos off to Vegas, her overnight \"ho bag\" in hand, and her new beau, played by Mike Tyson, waiting outside in a car. This apparent slackening of Perry's conservatism is perhaps the surest sign that Madea's work here is done. Her reign was ridiculous, and it was ours.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "More Money More Problems in Kenya Barris's \"#blackAF\"\n\nThink of the hashtag #blackAF as a millennial remix of mantras of self-love-\"Black is beautiful,\" \"I'm black and I'm proud.\" The phrase, printed on T-shirts and stamped on skin, has become a kind of shorthand for a politics of affirmation. But does it also veil a prickly insecurity? \"Black as fuck\" is the kind of thing an artist or a businessman might say about his work or his behavior in order to foreclose critique. After all, who is anyone to question anyone else's blackness? Employed earnestly, the phrase makes some people wary: Why the fuck do you feel that you have to proclaim your blackness? On the other hand: Why the fuck is it such big deal to you if I do?\n\nThe forty-five-year-old showrunner, producer, and writer Kenya Barris wants to be the commercial auteur of this identity paranoia. He is best known for the show \" black-ish ,\" which débuted on ABC in 2014, garnered a wave of hosannas from critics, and spawned two spinoffs. In 2018, he signed a potentially hundred-million-dollar deal with Netflix, a boon to his long-term project to make risky television about the black bourgeoisie. In \"#blackAF,\" Barris's inaugural Netflix series, he stars as Kenya, the filthy-rich creator of a successful show, called \"black-ish,\" who lives in a McMansion in Los Angeles with his six children and his lawyer wife, Joya (a very funny and liberated Rashida Jones). \"black-ish\" fans will get the most out of \"#blackAF,\" which is like its rawer, foulmouthed twin. As the Hollywood producer Tim Story, playing himself, puts it, in a brutal rib midway through the season, \" 'black-ish' seems to tap into the hearts and minds of fifty-five-year-old white women.\"\n\n\"#blackAF\" has alienated some black critics, who have argued that it simply retreads passé conversations about race and authenticity. The trap of seeking to be representative is one of the show's subjects; still, Kenya's personal dysphoria inevitably says something about the state of the black race. Non-critics seem to have a higher tolerance for the show's flaws, perhaps because it's funny. Barris isn't trying to make his magnum opus-he just wants to blow off some steam. One of the show's strengths is its filleting of stale network-sitcom character silhouettes. The Barris family is a picture of caustic dysfunction. One son is a \"pathological fucking liar\"; Kenya berates another for being \"soft.\" The youngest, a baby, toddles into the expansive kitchen and declares, \"I shit my diaper, Mommy.\" It's nothing for Kenya to call his daughter a \" THOT ,\" or for her to retort that he is a \"dick.\"\n\nKenya's garish Balenciaga tracksuits cloak a miser who worries that, in moving on up, from Inglewood to Encino, he's become a fraud, artistic and otherwise, and that he's passed the trait on to his privileged children. In \"black-ish,\" Barris sublimated his creative fear-that he was a glorified barrow boy who had benefitted from the hunger of the \"black wave\" in Hollywood-into the character of Dre, the head of the \"urban division\" at an advertising agency. In \"#blackAF,\" you wonder, and worry more than a bit, about whether Barris is acting at all.\n\nThe obvious corollary to \"#blackAF\" is \" Curb Your Enthusiasm ,\" but Barris is no Larry David , not yet-his writing doesn't do enough to distinguish the viewpoint of the show from that of its repellent protagonist. \"#blackAF\" also contains shades of \" The Bernie Mac Show \" and \"Real Husbands of Hollywood,\" Kevin Hart 's prescient, self-skewering series for BET. But Kenya's nouveau-riche anxieties belong most clearly to a broader tradition of black-male complaint: his wild swings from pomposity to soul-deadness and self-doubt recall comedians like Richard Pryor and Chris Rock , and rappers from Future to Jay-Z . His identity crisis is represented by a fat gold chain, which he makes plans to sell-\"am I a coon?\" he asks himself-but which stays on his neck all season long, an albatross.\n\nI was raised by nineties black television. UPN, Fox, and the WB were flush with sitcoms that featured black characters living in all-black worlds who didn't seem to emit a whiff of self-consciousness: \"Martin,\" \"The Wayans Bros.,\" \"Sister, Sister,\" \"Living Single,\" \"A Different World.\" It's said that only now are we living in the golden age of black film and TV, but that judgment hinges on a thirst for universal appeal. The rupture between nineties sitcoms and the current mode of autobiographical black television reflects the fact that black artists have joined the ranks of TV producers, showrunners, and writers. It also owes something to the investment of the white critical establishment in black culture. Today's satirical series can feel like extravagant forms of therapy made by power brokers who are dealing with the fact that they are no longer broke or powerless. Issa Rae has \" Insecure \"; Lena Waithe has \"Twenties,\" a fictionalization of her early life as a screenwriter. Hattie, Waithe's avatar, wants to work for the showrunner of \"My Bae,\" a series that she considers pandering and cynical. Her boss, folding her arms-a gesture of encouragement disguised as one of contempt-suggests that Hattie make her own show.\n\nWhereas \"black-ish\" was shot like a mockumentary, the framing device of \"#blackAF\" comes from Drea (Iman Benson), Kenya's second-oldest daughter and his intellectual rival. She is making a documentary about her family for her application to the film program at N.Y.U., and Kenya outfits her with a film crew. (\"They shot 'The Revenant' with less than this, O.K.?\" she says.) \"#blackAF\" is a messy show about the mess of making television; Barris's casting of some of the \"black-ish\" actors, and his recycling of the Greek-chorus motif (in the earlier show, a team of demographically diverse people at the advertising company; in the new one, a TV writers' room) gives \"#blackAF\" a television-for-television-writers appeal. Barris is responding, in part, to the curdling of the Zeitgeist since the Obama era, a period in which any art that seemed to analyze the performance of blackness was immediately deemed resonant. On each episode of \"black-ish,\" Barris used a trademark monologue to link a character's personal crisis to structural racism. In \"#blackAF,\" he parodies the speciousness of that device. \"Being dripped is literally part of who we are,\" Kenya says, unironically invoking slavery to justify his Mr. Porter addiction. The show's treatment of Juneteenth performs a similar function, reminding us of the way in which \"black-ish\" commemorated the holiday with a soaring piece of edutainment. In this series, perhaps truer to life, Juneteenth is just an excuse to drink brown liquor and bake a \"freedom cake.\"\n\nIn the fifth episode, which stands out for its surge of contained conflict, Kenya is asked to speak on a panel about a film, which he loathes, made by an up-and-coming black director. Everyone else, white and black, seems to love it. In advance of the event, he assembles a black-Hollywood counsel, including Tim Story, Will Packer, Ava DuVernay , and Issa Rae-who play themselves-over FaceTime. \"We do it all the time with white stuff,\" Kenya says, after he realizes that his peers are holding back from giving their true opinion of the film. \"Why can't we do it with our stuff?\" He is roundly dismissed by everyone except Waithe, who agrees to sit on the panel with him and to back him up on his critiques of the movie. But, when the time comes, she sells him out onstage, praising the film and babbling on about the power of representation. Barris and Waithe are impressively willing to parody themselves, but the result feels like self-defense masquerading as satire.\n\nThe other seven episodes blur into one another, lacking story or situation. I couldn't get enough of Jones as a loving, self-absorbed, rich-bitch mom, and I will never complain about a Nia Long cameo, especially one in which she's playing a hustler publicist. But \"#blackAF\" desperately needs fewer riffs and an expanded character universe to leaven its atmosphere of crushing self-indulgence. At the end of the season, Kenya has a pat, sitcom-style epiphany while watching a rerun of \"black-ish\" on a family vacation to Fiji. \"Such a good show,\" he says to himself. One kind of innocence allowed Barris to make \"black-ish.\" It was another kind that led to \"#blackAF.\" ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "The Generation After Malcolm X\n\n\"Do you know why the white man really hates you?\" Malcolm X would ask his black congregations in the nineteen-sixties. \"It's because every time he sees your face he sees a mirror of his crime-and his guilty conscience can't bear to face it.\" In the midst of what seemed the high moral adventure of Martin Luther King, Jr.,'s nonviolent civil-rights campaigns, Malcolm appeared as some marginal shadow-figure of wrath, always paralleling King's progress. A ghetto street hustler turned grimly austere evangelist for a racial subsect of Islam known as the Black Muslims, he became one of those unnerving black figures who periodically rise up before the eyes of white society as an image of its own systematic dehumanization, at once a casualty of and a judgment upon America's racism. In ghostly black-and-white news footage from that time, he can be glimpsed at street rallies of inner-city blacks-a long, lank, sober-suited figure, hatted and bespectacled-excoriating the white man in a level, measured tone with rapid licks of scorn: \"We don't want to have anything to do with any race of dogs.\" Spearing his forefinger in the air, he cries, \"Two-legged white dogs sicking four-legged dogs on your and my mother!\"\n\nTwenty-seven years after his sudden death, in a bedlam of gunfire in a Harlem auditorium, his presence still hangs palpably among us. It's not merely in the speckling of \"X\"s on caps and T-shirts which one now sees everywhere (even on Bill Clinton's jogging cap)-a ubiquitous pop rash that has anticipated the film biography by Spike Lee. In this cinematic Second Coming, Malcolm promises finally to pass, in one form at least, into the mythology of America. Of course, such theatrical reconstructions, like \"JFK\" and \"Mississippi Burning,\" can work their own polemically simplistic vandalisms on the past, coarsening the collective memory from which our understanding of our own times is formed.\n\nBeyond his ascension into the pop firmament, though, Malcolm abides among us in a far more elemental sense. From the turbulent black awakening of the sixties, two lines of descent-two temperaments, two potentials-have contended for the spirit of black Americans: a tension between the children of Martin and the children of Malcolm. Though King's perspective was far more radical than the eventual sentimentalism about him would lead one to suppose, it was suggested even in his day that his vision-of a transcendent, nonviolent struggle of moral confrontation that would shame a racist and essentially barbarous society into redemption-could never be more than a dream. But if it could be said that King's vision expected too much of the species, Malcolm's seemed a vision of humankind's nature reduced to the basest, most minimal terms of anger and retribution for abuse. Malcolm proclaimed to his black audiences that only fools \"could love someone who had treated them as the white man has treated you.\" He demonized the abuser as a \"blue-eyed white devil,\" genetically beyond any moral appeal, who would never consent to admit blacks into his company and was unworthy of such ambitions anyway-a predator who could properly be handled only with contempt and threat.\n\nTo no small degree, Martin and Malcolm were projections of two separate black cultures. King, the son of an eminent minister, had grown up in the comfortable insulation of Atlanta's black gentility-part of that black establishment eager to join in a civil-rights coalition with the nation's white liberal community. Malcolm, on the other hand, arose from the lowest reaches of the black urban underclass. In \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X,\" narrated shortly before his death to Alex Haley, Malcolm acknowledged, \"I know nothing about the South. I am a creation of the Northern white man and of his hypocritical attitude toward the Negro\"-an attitude closer, actually, to that of the nation as a whole.\n\nIt is now clear that Malcolm was in communion with submerged heats of anger far more widespread in the black community than most whites ever suspected. Peter Goldman, in his discerning 1973 biography, \"The Death and Life of Malcolm X,\" reports that when he was a newspaperman in St. Louis in the early sixties \"a bewildered cop told me that even the hookers and boosters were calling him a blue-eyed devil and would only talk to his black partner.\" Concurrent with King's nonviolent campaigns in the South was the emergence around the country of such guerrilla militants as the Black Panthers and radical young activists like Stokely Carmichael and H. Rap Brown, with their cries for \"black power!\" What disturbed some observers about this new phase of the movement was a contraction of its moral terms to a bitter cynicism that saw the human lot as one of hopeless racial alienation. I was covering the civil-rights movement in the South then, and one summer night in Greenwood, Mississippi, as King was conducting a mass meeting of fifteen hundred blacks in a local church, I sensed Malcolm's effect even there. King's voice pealed over the gathering, \"We have a power that's greater than all the guns in Mississippi, greater than all the bombs and armies of the world-we have the power of our souls! \" From several young partisans of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee scattered around the back of the church, there arose a counterpoint of derisive hoots: \"Oh, de Lawd! De Lawd , now!\"\n\nIf, all these years later, the tensions between the visions of Martin and Malcolm have endured in the black community, it can sometimes appear that Malcolm's flat, blank anger has carried the day-and not merely in a certain style of attitude, as evidenced by the swagger and bluster of many rap artists. How Malcolm's presence far more deeply lingers among us was illuminated by the recent upheavals in Los Angeles, after the acquittal of the policemen tried for the beating of Rodney King. But if the lasting racial alienations in America would seem to put King's high moral proposition in doubt, the irony is that at the time Malcolm was slain he had begun to move away from the fierce, implacable persona to which his mystique and his children have now fastened. He had broken with the Black Muslims, and in the last year of his life he had been venturing, however tentatively and unevenly, beyond the insular racial delirium of their doctrine and was approaching a more open and conciliatory vision-a vision closer, if still only in certain nuances, to King's own. James H. Cone, in his recent book \"Martin & Malcolm & America,\" writes that \"they complemented and corrected each other.\" Malcolm, in fact, was killed in the midst of a kind of metamorphosis. Just three days before his death, he confessed to a reporter, \"I'm man enough to tell you that I can't put my finger on exactly what my philosophy is now.\" Charles Kenyatta, one of his followers at the time, recently told me, \"All this hype now, they're trying to give the false image that Malcolm had come to be the Saviour of black people. But he didn't know himself who he was.\" In the end, he was groping, alone, for some different purpose, some different self-definition. Indeed, at no point in his life could Malcolm cease struggling, as if by dim but resistless instinct, for more light.\n\nAs Malcolm tells it in the \"Autobiography,\" he was born into rage and despair, in the spring of 1925, in Omaha. His mother, Louise Little, was from Grenada-a lithe, erect woman of somewhat finely strung nerves, whose own mother, Malcolm claimed, had been raped by a white man, and who was herself pale enough to be taken for white. His father, by contrast, was an oil-black roisterous colossus of a man, named Earl Little-a one-eyed construction laborer and part-time Baptist preacher from Reynolds, Georgia, who had struck out on his own after finishing either the third or the fourth grade. A brooding, disappointed man, full of turbulence, he had become a disciple of Marcus Garvey, who, in flamboyant plumed uniforms with gold braid,was Harlem's aspiring black-nationalist Moses in the early years of the century. Garvey was imprisoned for mail fraud the year Malcolm was born.\n\nFrom prison, Garvey had promised his believers, \"I shall come back to you. . . . Look for me in the whirlwind or the storm, look for me all around you.\" Earl took young Malcolm to fevered meetings of Garvey's faithful, where such messages were regularly invoked. Because of Earl's devotion to Garvey, according to a somewhat melodramatic account of Malcolm's, Klan night riders with torches swept down on the family's house in Omaha shortly before he was born. Certainly, as Malcolm later liked to cast it, white harassment had pursued Earl Little in his migratory struggle to scrap out a living for his family; he moved them briefly to Milwaukee, then to Lansing, Michigan, where their home was burned-by white racists, Malcolm would claim. Earl Little finally moved his family to a rural plot two miles out of East Lansing.\n\nThere, in a drab and wintry countryside, in a tar-shingle house of only four rooms, each with a single naked light bulb dangling over a rugless board floor, Malcolm passed his boyhood-a shabby and cheerless one, utterly unlike King's. His autobiography contains almost no mention of holidays like Christmas and Thanksgiving. His father ruled the family with frequent beatings, exempting only Malcolm, the fourth of seven children. Earl was particularly interested by his wife's scruples about diet: she disdained pork and rabbit. Once, Malcolm related to Haley, his father took a rabbit from the pen outside and ripped its head off with \"one twist of his big black hands,\" then flung the body at his wife's feet, ordering her to cook it, and stormed out of the house. It was the last time any of them saw him alive. Late that night, police brought word that he had been found, mangled and dying, beside some streetcar tracks, where he had apparently fallen under the wheels. Malcolm was then six years old. He later insisted that his father's death had also been the work of white racist vigilantes.\n\nIf Earl was gentler with Malcolm than with his other children, Malcolm surmised in his autobiography, it was because \"he was subconsciously so afflicted with the white man's brainwashing of Negroes that he inclined to favor the light ones, and I was his lightest child.\" Of a brassy hue-\"bright,\" it was sometimes called-he seemed tortured by the whiteness in him. He later told his followers, of the man he claimed had raped his mother's mother, \"Yes, that raping, red-headed devil was my grandfather! That close, yes! My mother's father! . . . If I could drain away his blood that pollutes my body, and pollutes my complexion, I'd do it! Because I hate every drop of the rapist's blood that's in me.\" There were moments, Malcolm said, when that most intimate of helpless outrages to his person left him \"so choked up\" that he would stalk the streets, solitary, late into the night.\n\nAfter his father's death, his mother struggled on in a Depression poverty so stark that sometimes she had nothing to feed her family except stale surplus bread and boiled dandelion greens, and the children would be \"dizzy\" with hunger. Malcolm, at school, would huddle off by himself to eat a wild-leek sandwich. Before long, the remnants of the family began to disintegrate. \"Some kind of psychological deterioration began to eat away our pride,\" Malcolm later said. At the age of nine, he began pilfering from stores in town. And his mother, sitting alone in a rocking chair chattering to herself with all window shades drawn, began to drift into insanity. The Christmas of Malcolm's thirteenth year, according to Bruce Perry's \"Malcolm,\" a formidably researched biography that appeared in 1991, his mother was found wandering barefoot along a snow-dappled road, dirty and unkempt and clutching a baby, her eighth, this one illegitimate. Shortly afterward, she was delivered into a state mental hospital. Her children were scattered about as wards of the state, and Malcolm was briefly in a detention home.\n\nSuch hurt does not readily permit the inward grace for any sort of transcendent understanding like King's. Its only gift is, perhaps, a certain icy unsentimentality, a terrible bleak clarity of consciousness. At any rate, Malcolm never forgave white society for what had happened to him. By that time, he had reached the seventh grade, and was a tall, gawky youth, preternaturally bright and quick, but he was resentful even of being elected class president by his white fellow-students: as he told Haley, \"I was unique in my class, like a pink poodle.\" Not unaware that he held a special promise, he speculated to his English teacher that he might like to become a lawyer; the teacher advised him, amiably, \"You've got to be realistic about being a nigger. . . . Why don't you plan on carpentry?\" Withdrawing into a sullen and wordless isolation, he dropped out of school after finishing eighth grade and went to live with a half sister in Boston's Roxbury section.\n\nThere he swiftly moved into a night world of black bars and pool halls and dance halls, where, he recounted in his autobiography, \"I met chicks who were fine as May wine, and cats who were hip to all happenings.\" He conked his hair to a sleek russet straightness with a scalp-scorching compound of lye, eggs, potatoes, Vaseline, and soap, and arrayed himself in billowy zoot suits of Crayola colors, with a long gold chain looped at the waist, a rakish wide-brimmed hat, orange bulb-toed shoes, and a pint flask in his inside coat pocket. He became something of a sensation on the ballroom floors for his abandon in dancing the Lindy. Before long, he was peddling dope, shooting craps, playing the numbers. After a time, he began keeping conspicuous company with a blond white woman, who regularly made expeditions to Roxbury's dance halls. He was then still in his mid-teens.\n\nHe managed to get a job as an attendant on Pullman trains between Boston and New York, and wound up staying in Harlem, which was, he remembered in his autobiography, \"like some technicolor bazaar. . . . This world was where I belonged.\" There, as he recounted it, he became one of the snazziest of hustlers. He was called Red, or sometimes, because he came from Michigan, Detroit Red. Running numbers, steering men to prostitutes, selling dope, using dope. He carried automatics now, which he would flourish in random stickups.\n\nBefore long, sensing that the police and, more important, a gambling enforcer were closing in on him in Harlem, he returned to Boston, and set up a small burglary ring, enlisting the white woman there whom he was still dating, and her sister, to scout promising residences from their base, a rented apartment in Harvard Square. \"Sometimes the victims were in their beds asleep,\" the \"Autobiography\" tells us. \"In stockinged feet, we'd go right into the bedrooms. Moving swiftly, like shadows, we would lift clothes, watches, wallets, handbags, and jewelry boxes.\" It was as if he were exacting from all white society his own form of reparations. But a certain lunging recklessness had set in to his operations by now. It was only a matter of time before he was apprehended. And in February of 1946 he began serving an eight-to-ten-year sentence for burglary. He was not quite twenty-one.\n\nConfined in Charlestown's Dickensian prison, whose closet-size cells had no plumbing, he kept himself in a constant rage, he told Haley, coming to be called Satan by his fellow-inmates, and spent much of his time pacing \"like a caged leopard,\" railing aloud to himself. He had, he later reflected, \"sunk to the very bottom of the American white man's society.\" And it was there that the Nation of Islam found him.\n\nIt came through the intercession of Malcolm's brothers and one of his sisters, who, in visits and letters to him in prison, told him they had converted to a faith they called the \"natural religion for the black man.\" Its creed was that the white man was, quite literally, the devil-a pale, blue-eyed race genetically predisposed to a systematic devastation of \"every race of man not white.\" It was an illumination that Malcolm compared to that of Paul on the road to Damascus-a blazing revelation that it was whites who had visited on him all the mortifications and torments of his past. He was so overcome by this discovery that, he recounted in the \"Autobiography,\" he resolved to spend the rest of his life informing white people about their true natures, and he began by scrawling letters to the mayor of Boston, the governor of Massachusetts, and President Truman.\n\nIn that enterprise, he came to realize that he had lost to the streets what little schooling he'd had: \"I didn't know a verb from a house.\" He began studying ferociously, copying out with a pencil on a blue-lined school writing tablet every word in the prison dictionary. He had taken a correspondence course in English, even one in Latin. In his cell at night, in the glow of the corridor light, he read digests of world history by H. G. Wells and Will Durant. He read commentaries on Herodotus and Socrates, and he read Schopenhauer, Kant, and Nietzsche, volumes on linguistics and etymology. He later told Haley, \"I didn't know what I was doing, but just by instinct I liked books with intellectual vitamins.\" In this prodigious exertion, he acquired the con's kind of enormous but eclectic, unproportioned learning.\n\nThis isometric amassment of scholarship was marked, particularly in its racial obsession, by odd gaps. In later life, he informed his audiences that blacks had been mistaken about their true enemies ever since they were brought captive to Jamestown \"in the year 1555.\" In a 1958 newspaper article (included in Clayborne Carson's \"Malcolm X: The FBI File\"), he referred to \"this Jesus who preached in Palestine, which is on the Arabian Peninsula.\" He once explained to Haley that Homer was among the Moors-\"Homer and Omar and Moor , you see, are related terms\"-who had been abducted from Africa by Europeans, blinded so they couldn't return, and forced to \"sing about the Europeans' glorious accomplishments.\" He argued that Shakespeare's plays were written by King James I, the same King James \"who poetically 'fixed' the Bible-which in itself and its present King James version has enslaved the world.\"\n\nAll this came to be mixed in with the Nation of Islam's racial theological history, which Malcolm earnestly subscribed to until almost the last year of his life. It was a kind of intellectual \"Fantasia\" that rivalled, in its fabulous loopiness, the racial anthropology of \"Mein Kampf.\" Original humankind was black, appearing about seventy trillion years ago. A sublime civilization, which founded the city of Mecca, and even exercised dominion over Mars, it was presided over by twenty-four wizards, or \"wise scientists,\" who created the animals and made the mountains, and even \"deported\" the moon from the earth. One of the wizards, a malcontent named Mr. Yacub, born about sixty-six hundred years ago and known as the \"big-head scientist,\" because he had an oversized cranium, learned how to breed races scientifically. When, for his seditious agitation, he was exiled from Mecca to the Isle of Patmos-later famed for the Book of Revelation-he contrived as revenge, Malcolm explained, a means of creating a \"bleached-out white race of devils.\" Mr. Yacub knew that black men contained two germs, black and brown, the lighter being the weaker. Through an eight-hundred-year process of genocidal culling-by means of needles inserted into the brains of unsuitably darker infants-that progressed from the black race to a brown, a red, and then a yellow race, the project at last produced a blond, pale-skinned, blue-eyed devil race, which wound up in the caves of Europe. In time, Malcolm reported, Moses was chosen by Allah to \"civilize\" these devils, the first with whom he succeeded being the Jews. But all the pallid devil race eventually gained ascendancy, through \"tricknology,\" and finally seized into slavery a portion of the Original People, the tribe of Shabazz, who had been led into Africa fifty thousand years earlier to harden and toughen them for their predestined ordeal.\n\nThis entire historical panorama had been disclosed, in Detroit, in 1931, to the future Messenger of the Lost-Found Nation of Islam in the Wilderness of North America, Elijah Muhammad-then still Robert Poole, a slight young migrant from rural Georgia, with only a fourth-grade schooling. The source of the revelation was an enigmatic figure known as Mr. Fard, a small, beige man who was a peddler of silks and yard goods. Mr. Fard, whose real name, according to Bruce Perry, was Wallace Dodd Ford, described himself generally as a \"brother\" from the East, but at one point he confided to Robert Poole that he was \"the Mahdi.\" In any case, after setting up the new Islamic sect in Detroit, he mysteriously disappeared. Some adherents believed he had returned to Mecca; others suspected he had been disposed of by the disciple into whose hands leadership of his little religion fell: Robert Poole, now calling himself Elijah Muhammad.\n\nIn 1952, after serving about six and a half years of his sentence, Malcolm was released on parole. He emerged from prison with his hair shorn close to his skull, in the Muslim fashion, and with only a ten-dollar suit; on his first day of freedom, he bought a new pair of eyeglasses, a wristwatch, and a suitcase. He passed more or less directly from prison into the community of the Nation of Islam, which must have seemed to him, after the ferocities of his life up to that point, like arriving in a paradise of calm and order.\n\nIts leader might have appeared, at first glance, a somewhat improbable mighty messenger of Allah. An elfin man of a delicate amber hue-a fragile bronchial asthmatic-Elijah had a peculiar daintiness of manner, with prim tightenings of the mouth, and he was usually dressed in a dull black suit with a black rubber-shiny bow tie and, on his head, a pillbox cap twinkling with a scimitar moon and radiant orbs and stars. But behind his wistful little demure smiles there lurked an unmistakable wiliness, and a cool deadliness of purpose: he reigned, after all, as the source and center of the Muslims' radioactive field of racial menace. Nevertheless, his message of a black Islamic elect of righteousness had effected wonders of regeneration among numerous souls lost, like Malcolm, in the spiritual desolation of America's ghettos. For his part, Malcolm would insist up to his end that he \"believed in Mr. Muhammad more than [Mr. Muhammad] believed in himself.\" His slave name of Little was now replaced by a symbol for his long-lost and unknown African family name: he became Malcolm X.\n\nOwing to his own rapt, consuming intensity, Malcolm was soon inducted into the Muslim ministry, and he was ultimately anointed by Elijah Muhammad to serve as a kind of peripatetic national missionary for the Muslims. Under his unflagging evangelism, the Nation of Islam swiftly expanded from a baroque and tiny variant of Islam, confined to about four hundred faithful who gathered mostly in storefront mosques, into, by 1960, a truly national congregation, of perhaps ten thousand registered followers, with some forty temples and missions spread across the country and a network of more than thirty radio stations. It formed a separate interior culture, with its own school system, its own economic complex of shops and service businesses, and its own religious militia of solemn, dark-suited centurion guards, called the Fruit of Islam.\n\nIn Harlem alone, where Malcolm now presided over the Nation's major mosque, he was addressing street rallies of fifteen thousand for up to four hours. One of his converts from the early years, Benjamin Karim, recalls, \"He held me spellbound. Listening to him, I began to understand how empty I was. And he put in me, in place of that emptiness, knowledge. And out of that came self-discovery, and pride.\" Malcolm moved ebulliently along Harlem's teeming sidewalks, a rangily tall, overcoated figure, talking with everybody-one of Harlem's own now returned, purged, to prophesy to his people. There was, indeed, with his glinting eyeglasses, a certain priestly quality about him. He lived modestly, in a succession of residences in Queens (they were provided him by the Muslims), drove a blue Oldsmobile, and dressed in staid funeral-director suits, with a tie clip of a leaping sailfish, and unfailingly polished plain black shoes. He was scrupulously-almost fanatically-punctual, and ceaselessly entered notations with a red ballpoint pen in a red pocket notepad. He had about him a tightly machined self-containment. His only betrayal of excitement or anger, at some moment of confrontation, was a rosy tinge rising, under his brassy hue, from neck to face. \"I was with him for seven or eight years,\" Karim, who became one of Malcolm's assistant ministers, told me. \"I was as close as anybody could get to him without burning up. But It was impossible to really know him. Nobody could really get close to him.\" When one of Malcolm's brothers-the very one who had first introduced him to Islam in prison-later defected from the faith and then lapsed, like his mother, into insanity, Malcolm commented, with a strangely chill detachment, that \"it was meant, for Reginald to be used for one purpose only: as a bait, as a minnow to reach into the ocean of blackness where I was, to save me.\"\n\nIndeed, he could take on at times the grimness of a Torquemada. He fervently observed the Muslim strictures against not only the common carnal vagaries like fornication but also dating, dancing, smoking, drinking, movies, gambling, sports, and eating more than one meal a day. He usually slept just four hours a night. About the only indulgences he allowed himself were coffee and, late at night, tea. He permitted himself to watch only newscasts on television. There was a fastidious priggishness about him. He abstained from profanity and also from slang, once reproving Alex Haley for referring to children as \"kids\": \"Kids are goats! \"\n\nHe was yet more forbidding when it came to the daughters of Eve. \"All women, by their nature, are fragile and weak: they are attracted to the male in whom they see strength,\" he declared in the \"Autobiography.\" Moreover, \"you never can fully trust any woman. . . . Whatever else a woman is, I don't care who the woman is, it starts with her being vain.\" Karim remembers that Malcolm would admonish women about how to dress, telling them, \"If you walking down the street with a piece of fresh meat in your hand, you can't blame a dog for snatching the meat. If you exposing meat, you either selling it or giving it away.\" At the same time, though, he would assure the women in his audiences that \"the black man never will get anybody's respect until he first learns . . . to shelter and protect and respect his black women!\"\n\nFor that matter, Malcolm kept himself an ascetic bachelor until, in 1956, he began to notice in the congregation at his mosque in Harlem a tall, dark-brown young woman named Betty Sanders. Born in Detroit, she had been an education major at Tuskegee Institute, in Alabama, and was now studying nursing at a New York hospital. She had not yet converted to Islam, but what struck her about Malcolm, she told me recently, was \"his intensity.\" She said, \"I thought, You can't play with this guy-he's serious.\" He also had what she calls \"a high civility,\" and, she recalls, \"When he used this high civility, a lot of girls took it to mean that he was interested in them. I was not going to be one of those fickle-hearted little females.\" She carefully maintained a sober tone in their first encounters, at a nearby restaurant. \"However, there came a time when I thought\"-and here she gave a girlish flip at the back of her hair with her hand-\"I was on to something.\" When she indicated that she might do a lot of partying after graduating from nursing school, Malcolm reacted with an instant, visible alarm. When she eventually introduced him to her parents, who were Methodists, he struck them as \"a marvellous young man-clean-cut, and he knows so much,\" but when she asked them if they would like him as a son-in-law \"it was a little different,\" she says. In fact, they were horrified by the possibility that he might take her, their only child, away from them forever into the mysterious and alien world of the Muslims. Just over a year later, after Betty's conversion, and in accordance with a carefully and gravely deliberated arrangement sanctioned by Mr. Muhammad, they were married. Malcolm was then thirty-two. Betty's parents became estranged from her, and reconciled themselves to Malcolm only after she began bearing his children. \"They finally accepted his 'difference,' \" she says.\n\nBut marriage hardly mellowed the fury of Malcolm's obsessive pentecostalisms against America's devil rule: that mission had become the total meaning of his life. According to F.B.I. files, he declared, with an air of celebration, \"We, the black men of the world, created the white man and we will also kill him. . . . Only in this way can there be peace on the earth.\" He named his first daughter Attilah, he later explained, for the Hun who \"sacked Rome.\"\n\nWith the narrowed stare of his eyes giving Malcolm himself a vaguely Tatar aspect, he took on, for many whites, a sulfurous malevolence. Indeed, it does no service, either to the reality of Malcolm or to history, to try to moderate in memory the racial vituperativeness of his oratory then. \"We don't want to integrate with that ole pale thing!\" he would cry to black audiences, light flashing blankly off his glasses. \"The dog is their closest relative. They got the same kind of hair, the same kind of skin, and the same kind of smell . Oh, yeaaah! \"\n\nIt was a racial invective that was only an inverse, in fact, of that to be heard whinnying from the flatbed loudspeakers at any cow-pasture Klan rally of the time. Malcolm insisted this was only reflexive to four hundred years of white racism, but it captured him in the same cramped, bleak mentality, which placed a racial construction on all life. Malcolm readily professed that he shared the Southern whites' aversion to integration, as a sure prelude to miscegenation. As he declared, integrationists \"want your wife and your daughter and your sister and-and your mother .\"\n\nIt is not, then, quite so bizarre as it might first seem that one night in 1961 Malcolm held a clandestine meeting with Klan chieftains in Atlanta to solicit their support for the Muslim ambition to establish a separate country within the United States. He told the assembled Klansmen that the Muslims were as deeply committed to segregation as they were, and, according to an F.B.I. report, assured them that \"the Jew is behind the integration movement, using the Negro as a tool.\"\n\nTwo years earlier, he had pronounced the Jews \"one of the worst of the devils,\" claiming, \"He does more to take advantage of the so-called black people than any other and yet poses as being a friend.\" He averred at one rally, Peter Goldman reports, that \"everybody talks about the six million Jews. But I was reading a book the other day that showed that one hundred million of us were kidnapped and brought to this country- one hundred million . Now everybody's wet-eyed over a handful of Jews who brought it on themselves.\"\n\nIn general, his fulminations seemed to carry an unappeasable malignance, which impossibly outraged white sensibilities. He declared that because of the genetically determined iniquity of all whites, in any race war it would be imperative to slay even their children. In 1962, not long after seven unarmed Muslims were shot, one of them fatally, in an altercation with the Los Angeles police, it happened that at Orly Airport, near Paris, a chartered jet bearing many of Atlanta's cultural élite crashed during takeoff. \"I would like to announce a very beautiful thing that has happened,\" Malcolm told a Muslim rally in Los Angeles, according to the F.B.I. \"As you know, we have been praying to Allah. . . . And I got a wire from God today.\" Allah \"really had answered our prayers . . . in one whop,\" he went on. \"He dropped an airplane out of the sky with over one hundred and twenty white people on it.\" And \"we will continue to pray and we hope that every day another plane falls out of the sky.\" He could be just as pitiless about the deaths of white civil-rights workers. Goldman reports that when a white minister perished under the tracks of a bulldozer during a demonstration at a construction site in Cleveland, Malcolm told an audience in New York, \"What he did-good, good, great. What he did-good. Hooray, hooray, hooray. . . . It's time some white people started dying in this thing.\"\n\nIn all, Malcolm was still operating from his old, street hustler's cynicisms. He contemplated the gathering civil-rights struggle, and its leaders, with the deepest disdain. The whole appeal for integration seemed to him craven, a spectacle of the abused who, out of some perverse compulsion, were \"trying to unite\" with their abusers. All that the movement was achieving anyway, as in Birmingham, was \"promises that they will be able to sit down and drink some coffee with some crackers in a cracker restaurant,\" as an F.B.I. report quoted him. \"Now, what kind of advancement is that. They still don't have a job.\" He particularly deplored the principle of nonviolence. \"I believe it's a crime for anyone who is being brutalized to continue to accept that brutality without doing something to defend himself,\" he told Haley. \"If that's how 'Christian' philosophy is interpreted, if that's what Gandhian philosophy teaches, well, then, I will call them criminal philosophies.\" He held a special contempt for King. Charles Kenyatta, who is now a Baptist minister in Harlem, remembers that, in private, \"Malcolm had always said, when he met King, he was gonna hit him in the jaw and see just how nonviolent he really was.\"\n\nAlthough, as some have pointed out, Malcolm never directly urged in public the initiation of any specific act of outright violence, his oratory fairly reeled with exultant anticipation of an impending racial Armageddon, some \"maximum retaliation against racist oppressors\" in a \"racial conflict . . . that could easily escalate into a violent, worldwide, bloody race war.\" Kenyatta recalls, \"I thought, the way Malcolm was talking, just had to be some unhidden guns and armies somewhere. He preached once, 'Anybody lays a hand on you when you go out of here, think five times.' And I told him, 'You done brought me all the way up here ready to kill somebody, what you mean 'Wait five times'?\"\n\nKing, for his part, in an interview with Playboy did not conceal his misgivings about Malcolm's \"demagogic oratory,\" saying of Malcolm's \"litany of articulating the despair of the Negro without offering any positive, creative alternative\" that he felt that \"Malcolm has done himself and our people a great disservice.\" It was as if they were talking two different languages. While King refused to engage Malcolm in any open confrontation, he did occasionally indicate privately that he might like to have a conversation with him at some point. In fact, they encountered each other only once, and only glancingly-when both happened to be in the corridors of the Capitol during the debate on the 1964 civil-rights bill. Malcolm pounced to King's side. They exchanged amenities and briefly clasped hands, King's smile faint and tentative, Malcolm's a wide grin, in a flaring of flashbulbs. But that was it. They quickly parted and returned to their separate realms.\n\nWhen Malcolm's startling separation from the Nation of Islam came about, in late 1963, the pretext initially given was that Elijah Muhammad had been dismayed by remarks of Malcolm's about the assassination of President Kennedy. Kennedy's slaying was \"the chickens coming home to roost,\" Malcolm had said, and it made him \"glad.\" He maintained that he had in mind, among other things, Kennedy's allowing the death, in a coup, of South Vietnam's dictator Ngo Dinh Diem. At the headquarters of the Nation of Islam, in Chicago, the day after he made these remarks, he was told by Elijah Muhammad, \"That was a very bad statement. . . . I'll have to silence you for the next ninety days-so that the Muslims everywhere can be disassociated from the blunder.\" Malcolm initially submitted to this discipline, but he later asserted in his autobiography, \"I hadn't hustled in the streets for years for nothing. I knew when I was being set up.\"\n\nCharles Kenyatta, who was given the name Charles 37X, recalls, \"Malcolm had become the money-maker. He had taken them out of the wilderness and brought them into the Promised Land, where all of a sudden they were being looked on as a very powerful organization.\" But tensions had been developing for some time, among those around Messenger Muhammad, over Malcolm's growing national conspicuousness. To be sure, Malcolm did seem to have become fascinated by his reflection in the media, white devils' instrument or no. He would willingly sit for three-hour interviews with the press. While he grumbled in the \"Autobiography\" that the media had \"somehow\" managed to filch his home phone number, he had actually slipped it to journalists himself. Kenyatta later lamented to Goldman that the media's bright mirror \"really destroyed him,\" and went on to say, \"He got drunk off it. He used to sit by the TV set and watch himself, and you could see how much he liked it.\" Increasingly, in the national eye, Malcolm himself became the Muslims. He had first attracted the attention of the F.B.I. in 1953, when it was informed that he might be a Communist sympathizer. But what sustained the Bureau's continued surveillance was a curiosity about him as an exotic racial incendiary. In any case, according to one F.B.I. undercover report, Elijah Muhammad finally complained to Malcolm that he had been constantly \"hearing about MALCOLM this and MALCOLM that and even MALCOLM being called leader.\" Malcolm must never forget that he was \" ELIJAH'S property.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Malcolm, as his engagement with the world around him expanded, had been growing restive within the confines of the Black Muslims' righteous ghetto, the isolation of its millennial racial mythos. Despite all his berating of the civil-rights movement, he found himself increasingly stirred by the spectacle it presented, as the most powerful mass drama then unfolding in the black community. As many blacks saw it, he said, \"Muslims talk tough, but they never do anything.\"\n\nBut there was more to his restiveness than that. Elijah Muhammad, he had heard earlier in 1963, had engaged in dalliances with a succession of young secretaries, and some of them were pregnant or had already borne what members of Muhammad's court delicately referred to as \"divine babies.\" This news left Malcolm profoundly stunned. \"I had discovered Muslims had been betrayed by Elijah Muhammad himself,\" he told Haley, and he described its effect on him in almost Shakespearean terms: \"I felt as though something in nature had failed, like the sun, or the stars.\"\n\nWhen word of Malcolm's reaction got back to the Muslims' inner councils, he was called to a session with Elijah Muhammad, beside the swimming pool of Muhammad's home in Phoenix, which had been acquired for him out of solicitude for his bronchial disorder. An implausibly frail and wheezy gnome to have disported himself so briskly with teen-age nymphs, Elijah explained that these activities had been an exercise Biblically imposed upon him. \"You recognize that's what all of this is-prophecy,\" he said, according to Malcolm. \"I'm David. When you read about how David took another man's wife, I'm that David. You read about Noah, who got drunk-that's me. You read about Lot, who went and laid up with his own daughters. I have to fulfill all of those things.\" Charles 37X was with Malcolm at this last session with Elijah Muhammad. \"The old man told Malcolm\"-at this point, Kenyatta stood and wagged his forefinger-\" 'Son, go back and put that fire out. Or my followers are gonna hurt you.' But Malcolm had too much pride to do that.\"\n\nMalcolm still viewed a final excision from the Muslim faithful with considerable reluctance and trepidation, however, and for some months he kept up a kind of furtive scrimmaging to ease himself back into a family whose elders had already effectively disowned him. Yet, at the same time, he began industriously distributing word of the Messenger's indecorous frolickings to others within the Nation of Islam, among them the future Louis Farrakhan, a natty and bright-eyed former calypso singer who was then presiding over the Boston mosque. He, along with others, relayed the tidings of Malcolm's betrayal back to Chicago. Then Malcolm, in escalating desperation, disclosed the matter publicly. Journalists hesitated to run the story at first, because of libel considerations. (One reporter told him, though, according to an F.B.I. wiretap, that he \"wished to God he could print the bit about the divine babies.\") Finally, Malcolm managed to persuade three of Muhammad's former secretaries to furnish affidavits, and two of them to file paternity suits.\n\nIn due time, Malcolm received a telegram from a captain of the Fruit of Islam in Chicago, stating, \"Mr. Malcolm: We hereby officially warn you that the Nation of Islam shall no longer tolerate your scandalizing the name of our leader and teacher the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.\" A few months earlier, an F.B.I. wiretap had picked up a call to Malcolm's home by an unidentified person who instructed the woman who answered, \"Just tell him he is as good as dead.\" Malcolm himself was confident that someone in the Muslim ranks would \"take it upon himself to kill me as a 'religious duty,' \" as he put it to Haley. But, he declared, what to him was worse than death \"was the betrayal.\" Even at that point, \"I could conceive death. I couldn't conceive betrayal.\" Indeed, when it became plain that he was now permanently cast out from the Muslims' midst, he wept.\n\nThe previous spring, perhaps not coincidentally, Malcolm set out alone on a pilgrimage to Mecca, and afterward he claimed to have discovered that the Black Muslim racial dogma had all along been an eccentric aberration, and no part of true, classical Islamic theology. At the airport in Cairo, among a multitude of other pilgrims headed for Mecca, he removed his Western apparel and wrapped his waist and shoulders in two white cloths, his long rusty-skinned legs now extending bare and ostrichlike below, and he had shoved his large feet into sandals. On the flight to Jedda, he told Haley, he was awed to find the plane crammed with \"white, black, brown, red, and yellow people, blue eyes and blond hair, and my kinky red hair-all together, brothers.\" On the verge, as it were, of a second release from a captivity-this one a release he had never anticipated-he was filled with exhilaration to note that \"the whole atmosphere was of warmth and friendliness.\" He said, \"The feeling hit me that there really wasn't any color problem here.\" Upon reaching Mecca, he found himself eating \"from the same plate . . . with fellow Muslims, whose eyes were the bluest of blue, whose hair was the blondest of blond, and whose skin was the whitest of white.\" In all his life, he said afterward, it was \"the first time I had ever stood before the Creator of All and felt like a complete human being.\"\n\nHis wonder and elation over such commonplace cordialities somehow hinted at the childlike simplicity-innocence, even-that had lurked all along under the ferocities of his racial exhortations back in America. Exorbitant or not, this euphoria-\"Why, the men acted as if they were brothers of mine!\"-now prompted in him, he declared, \"the start of a radical alteration in my whole outlook about 'white' men.\" If there seemed an oddly poignant naïveté in his jubilation, a part of that naïveté was also a capacity for belief so instant and total, as the actor Ossie Davis would tell Peter Goldman, that \"when he saw something, he embraced it. . . . It was wow! a truth! and he grabbed it.\"\n\nHe returned to New York-with a scanty goatee, and wearing an Astrakhan hat-no longer the Malcolm X of his Black Muslim years but with a new name, honoring his completion of the pilgrimage: he was now El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz. He held a press conference at Kennedy Airport-a pandemonious convocation-at which he announced his enlightenment and his transformation. \"In the past, yes, I have made sweeping indictments of all white people,\" he said, but, after what he had experienced in Mecca, \"I never will be guilty of that again,\" and he added, \"A blanket indictment of all white people is as wrong as when whites make blanket indictments against blacks.\"\n\nOver the following months, it did seem that he had moved significantly beyond his old simple racial fixations toward what he described in his autobiography as \"a new insight\": that \"the white man is not inherently evil, but America's racist society influences him to act evilly.\" And it was less a matter of economics than a \"historical neurotic pathology-the abiding and almost limitlessly complex permeation of society by the legacy of slavery, a \"political, economic, and social atmosphere .\" His mission now was \"to help create a society in which there could exist honest white-black brotherhood,\" and in which \"both races, as human beings, had the obligation, the responsibility, of helping to correct America's human problem\" and, ultimately, \"to change this miserable condition that exists on this earth.\"\n\nIt is easy to make a bit too much of this development in Malcolm: it was, at most, only the beginning of a transmutation. He never became able, for instance, to accept the ethic of nonviolence; in fact, in the very press conference in which he proclaimed his new racial illumination he had also recommended that blacks form rifle clubs and otherwise arm themselves in case of attack. Neither had he lost his essential mistrust of the whole concept of integration. Even in Mecca, he contended in the \"Autobiography,\" there was \"a color pattern to the huge crowds. . . . I saw that people who looked alike drew together and most of the time stayed together.\" More dismally, there continued to gutter in him the old, acrimonious suspicions that \"so many Jews actually were hypocrites.\" As for whites: \"Let sincere whites go and teach nonviolence to white people!\"\n\nBut now, in his striving to free himself from other thralls in his past, he found that, in contrast to his almost immediate and total new birth in prison, he had to develop and define this regeneration extemporaneously and on his own. Peter Goldman, in a recent conversation, spoke of Malcolm at that time as being in \"a period of explosive and chaotic growth, re-creating himself on the run.\" Benjamin Karim, his longtime associate, whose own memoir is shortly to be published, said that at the time he \"saw a person who was trying to remake himself into another image, one that was not racially inclined-not to like or dislike a person according to his race. Committed to brotherhood , you know. Some of the people with him-because of ignorance, he had to deal with them about that.\" Malcolm even went so far as to propose what once, when he was a Black Muslim, would have been heresy-that blacks might use the vote to achieve political power. But he had wandered into a kind of thematic no man's land, caught between the simple clear rancors of his past and his still unformed mission for a more hopeful future. Charles Kenyatta says he cautioned Malcolm, \"You can't tamper with another person's God if you don't have another to give them.\" Karim, who left the Muslims with Malcolm, says, \"He had to shift into another gear he didn't know about. He never found that gear. He never came into focus. And that was right down to the last day.\" Malcolm had lost the simple certitude that is vital for any leader, and he was balked on every side: the civil-rights movement rejected him as too militant, and the militants discounted him as too moderate. He once blurted to Haley, \"They won't let me turn the corner! I'm caught in a trap!\"\n\nNow that he was outside the society of the Muslims, he found that, for the first time since emerging from prison, he no longer had any real place. He improvised two organizations of his own-Muslim Mosque, Inc., and a more secular operation, which he called the Organization of Afro-American Unity. A good two years before the widely heard calls for \"black power\" and the eventual, now commonplace invocations of \"community control,\" he called for a form of black nationalism that was his own variation on the Muslims' concept of self-contained black neighborhoods, taking their own economies and politics into their own hands. Beyond that, he sought to develop an active bond between the black society in America and the Mother Continent-a sort of Pan-African black Zionism promising a massive liberation of spirit for America's black minority as it identified with the world's overwhelming dark majority. In turn, he exhorted African nations to call the United States to account before the United Nations, for the oppression of its black population-as they had called South Africa to account in November of 1961, in the wake of the Sharpeville massacre. This was all an inspiration that had evolved from two journeys he made through Africa in the months following his pilgrimage to Mecca. To him, those journeys had seemed the ultimate spiritual homecoming, a return at last to the lost Eden of the Old Country. In those visits, as he forged about, looped in cameras and ceaselessly, greedily taking pictures, he was welcomed by governments there with much pomp and celebration, as if he were a visiting ex-officio head of state.\n\nAt the same time, though, some Africans were a bit disconcerted by the pallor of his skin, and assumed he was an albino. He tended to be considered more an American than an African. Most of all, the African governments he had entreated to indict the United States before the United Nations later proved singularly reluctant to oblige him, and thereby jeopardize the considerable American aid they were receiving.\n\nIn a sense, then, in moving beyond the Muslims-\"the only group that really cares about you,\" he had been taught-Malcolm found that he had moved into a kind of void. Benjamin Karim remembers that at the time \"he was living on the edge. Before that, he had everything set up for him. Now he had to do it on his own. For the first time, he became very edgy, very sensitive.\" What was particularly painful, Malcolm was repudiated by Muhammad Ali, whom he had tutored in the Muslim faith over a period of three years, while Ali was still Cassius Clay. In the first days of Malcolm's suspension by Elijah Muhammad from public speaking, Ali had invited him and his family down to his training camp in Miami Beach before his heavyweight title fight with Sonny Liston-a kindness for which Malcolm remained passionately grateful. But at the time of Malcolm's final, open break with the Muslims, Ali told Haley, \"You just don't buck Mr. Muhammad and get away with it. I don't want to talk about him no more.\" When their paths happened to cross in Africa, Malcolm addressed Ali as \"Brother,\" but Ali, according to an F.B.I. report, remarked to his entourage afterward, \"Man, did you get a look at him? Dressed in that funny white robe and wearing a beard and walking with a cane that looked like a prophet's stick? Man, he's gone so far out he's out completely. . . . Nobody listens to that Malcolm anymore.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the high pageantry of the civil-rights movement continued to sweep past, oblivious of him. He became, in fact, a familiar figure looming tall and alone at the margins of its rallies and demonstrations, again thickly hung with cameras and earnestly taking pictures of the proceedings. \"He wanted so much to come on in, to be a part of it,\" Kenyatta remembers. \"He had always this dream to belong.\" From abroad, he had directed an aide to write letters to leaders of the movement, offering his hope that his \"new position\" might be \"attractive to you.\" Back home, he made blurting attempts to reach out to them more directly. Once, when I was covering King's campaign in St. Augustine, Florida, in which his marchers were undergoing Walpurgis Nights of Klan mayhem, I learned that Malcolm had sent a telegram to King, assuring him that, on his word, \"we will immediately dispatch some of our brothers there to organize our people into self defense units . . . and the Ku Klux Klan will receive a taste of its own medicine.\" King's reaction to this overture was, as I recall it, one of appalled dismay.\n\nWhile King was in jail during the Selma demonstrations, Malcolm was invited by Snick partisans, for their own mischievous designs, to address a mass meeting in a Selma church. Malcolm wound up seated on the podium beside Coretta Scott King. At one point, he leaned close and whispered to her-with what seemed an apologetic and wistful urgency, Coretta later recalled-\"to let Martin know he was not causing trouble or making it difficult, but that he was trying to make it easier,\" that he simply wanted to confront whites with \"an alternative\" to King's appeal. In his address, he made no equivocation about his own aversion to nonviolence but pointed out that whites \"better be glad Martin Luther King is rallying the people because other forces are waiting to take over if he fails.\"\n\nBut his past would not turn him loose. He began to see everywhere, he said, on the streets and in elevators and in passing cars, \"the faces of Muslims whom I knew, and I knew that any of them might be waiting for the opportunity to try and put a bullet into me.\" Of this period Kenyatta remembers, \"We were on the move, one place to another, trying to dodge the bullets.\" Malcolm was also floundering financially, sustaining himself on loans and lecture fees and the less than imposing collections at his services, and finally, toward the end, on advances on his autobiography. Furthermore, a court had found for a claim by the Muslims that they were the legal owners of a house in East Elmhurst, Queens, occupied by Malcolm and his family-a house, Betty Shabazz still insists, that had been given to her by Elijah Muhammad himself as a wedding gift. And there now drew close the harrowing near-certainty that Malcolm, his pregnant wife, and their four daughters would be evicted from their home.\n\nMalcolm had often claimed that his earliest memory was of waking up, when he was four, amid the flames and chaos of the fire at his home in Lansing and of his father shooting at two white men fleeing into the night. Now, some thirty-five years later, he found himself on the eve of a virtually inevitable court denial, in a Monday-morning hearing, of his last appeal to prevent the Muslims from flushing him and his family out of their home and repossessing it. And in the black early-morning hours of that Sunday there was a boom and a glare of flames around the house, and once again he was standing amid his family, in pajamas, with children crying, out in the yard, watching his home burn. Dawn showed that about half of it was scorched and spottily charred, from two fires-one that had exploded in the front parlor, the other at a back window.\n\nIn a service at the Audubon Ballroom, in Harlem, two evenings later, Malcolm declared, \"My house was bombed by the Muslims! . . . I wouldn't care for myself if they would not harm my family!\" However, it is not readily apparent why members of the Nation of Islam, whatever their general balefulness, might have wished to terrorize Malcolm out of the house by burning it, on the eve of the almost certain affirmation of an eviction order that they had already obtained. \"We own this place, man,\" a Muslim chieftain protested. \"We have money tied up here.\" The Nation of Islam asserted that the fire had been Malcolm's own handiwork-what might seem a manifestly absurd suggestion, since his four small daughters were sleeping in the house at the time.\n\nNevertheless, close scrutiny of some of the evidence does make it appear at least a peculiar affair. An F.B.I. summary of police and Fire Department reports states that while Betty told the firemen that she had been the first to awaken and had roused Malcolm, he stated that he awoke himself and discovered the fire. According to the summary, the only alarms came from two chance witnesses, a neighbor and a passing taxi-driver, who heard the window glass shatter but saw no one outside the house either in front or in back. Shortly after the fire was extinguished, investigators found the neck of a whiskey bottle containing a scorched cloth wick in the back yard, about fifteen feet from a broken bedroom window with a scorched venetian blind. Oddly, though, as Bruce Perry noted in \"Malcolm,\" the window glass had scattered only into the yard, not into the room, and a fan pattern of burned weeds suggested that the bottle had actually been thrown from inside the house. A whiskey bottle containing a small amount of gasoline was found on the unburned front porch, which led firemen to suspect that gasoline from the bottle had been first splashed around the parlor and set afire, and the bottle left broken on the porch. Even more suspicious, the summary reported that \"a quart whiskey bottle filled with gasoline was located standing upright on the dresser\" in a rear bedroom, and that \"this bottle had a screw cap which was intact and did not have rags attached to it.\" Malcolm afterward attested that it was his wife who had first called the firemen's attention to the bottle. And, according to Perry, when a fireman picked up the bottle it left a clear circle amid the soot from the fire which had settled on the dresser top-evidence that the bottle had been set there before the fire. After stories appeared about the discovery of this gasoline-filled bottle, Malcolm maintained that it had been planted in the house, and postulated a conspiracy between the police, the Fire Department, the press, and the Black Muslims. The question is how the police or the firemen could have deposited in the room precisely the same sort of bottle that had been used to fire the house. It seems inescapable that the hand that set the bottle on the dresser was the one that had poured the contents of the others about the house and flung them out the windows. The difficulty with such a conclusion, of course, is that it assumes that Malcolm would knowingly put his children at risk.\n\nMalcolm's mood at the time had become one of cornered frenzy. He told Haley that when he concluded that Elijah Muhammad had sanctioned his extermination \"my head felt like it was bleeding inside.\" Some of the people close to him began to fear that he was approaching a psychic shattering. He seemed given more and more to a kind of blindly barging, barely contained berserkness, in which his resorting to such a personal scorched-earth recourse would not be wholly inconceivable-allowing him then to call down on the Muslims the vengeance at least of a public outrage and condemnation. As he declared afterward, \"I'm waking up America to the great Muslim menace.\"\n\nMoreover, Bruce Perry has discovered that the Lansing fire that traumatized Malcolm as a child-the fire he had always avowed to be the work of white racists-may have been set by his father, who, Perry found, had also faced eviction, and was briefly jailed for arson: a two-gallon oilcan that had contained kerosene was found under a bedspring in the basement; Earl Little had purchased kerosene only hours before the fire. Both the Lansing fire and the East Elmhurst fire occurred at 2:30 A.M. ,and during the days following the East Elmhurst fire rumor had it that Malcolm's wife appeared visibly enraged at him. When I asked her about the fire recently, she said, \"I'm not gonna talk about all that now.\"\n\nThe week after the fire was the last week of Malcolm's life. His protégé Louis Farrakhan had announced in a Muslim newspaper, with the scorpion vigor for which he later became more widely noted, \"The die is set, and Malcolm shall not escape. . . . Such a man as Malcolm is worthy of death.\" The Chicago elect, Goldman reports, issued a tape-recorded statement, to be played for other temple memberships, that Malcolm was due to be \"blasted clear off the face of the earth.\" Malcolm said that in the Nation of Islam \"any death-talk for me could have been approved of-if not actually initiated-by only one man.\" What confronted him now was like the most primal of dreads-that the man who had been his soul's true father wanted to kill him. Kenyatta recalls that, even after all that had happened, Malcolm \"missed the old man more than the old man missed him. He was so close to a breakdown that he wanted death, that's how close he was.\" Malcolm declared, \"Black men are watching every move I make, awaiting their chance to kill me. . . . Anyone who chooses not to believe what I am saying doesn't know the Muslims in the Nation of Islam.\" He seemed to move sluggishly, fitfully, in a trance of doom. \"Each day I live as if I am already dead,\" he told Haley, and kept assuring others, \"I'm a dead man.\" And the irony of this inevitability did not escape him: that the Muslim faithful could be trusted to deliver on their threats \"because I taught them myself.\" It was as if he were ambushed from the past by his own hand. In the end, for all Malcolm's apostleship of wrath over the years, the only violence his message ever demonstrably precipitated was upon himself.\n\nThe Audubon Ballroom in Harlem was on the second floor of a building with an arcing roof that looked from outside like an airplane hangar or a civic gymnasium. A frumpish, musty relic from the dance-hall years of Malcolm's past, it had been converted into an auditorium for his post-Nation of Islam ministry, with folding chairs for a congregation of four hundred. On the mild afternoon of Sunday, February 21, 1965, it was filled with a wan wintry light.\n\nAs had become Malcolm's policy, despite the miasma of threats surrounding him now, those entering the ballroom were not searched at the door. Moreover, the New York City Police, who had provided a twenty-man uniformed guard detail, were asked to post all but two of them outside. Charles Kenyatta was standing in the back of the ballroom and noticed the absence of police. \"I said to two or three of the brothers, 'What is this? What's goin' on?' They said, 'This is the way he wanted it, didn't want any security.' He had come to long to die. That's the reason he pulled those guards. Seemed he was just asking for it. I told him, 'We can't keep on goin' like this. Got to be some fightin' back. You lost your street knowledge.' But Malcolm said, 'You have lost your faith in Allah.' Thing was, Malcolm felt under a stroke of fate.\" Kenyatta paused for a moment, and continued, \"Listen, he was lonely. That's why he wanted to die. He wanted to be a martyr. He knew.\"\n\nEarlier that morning, in his room, at the midtown Hilton, where he had stayed overnight, Malcolm put on a dark-brown suit over, despite the unusual balminess of that February day, long-john underwear. He talked to Betty on the phone, telling her not to come to the rally. But before leaving he called her back, saying that he did want her there. Malcolm had also asked several community notables and ministers, and also the Ossie Davises and Martin Luther King's attorney, to join him on the platform for the afternoon's service, but when he arrived at the Audubon he learned that none of them would be coming. In a small anteroom offstage, he barked sharply at a young woman there, an O.A.A.U. assistant, and then, according to Haley, a little before going out to speak he apologized to her, saying, \"I'm just about at my wit's end.\"\n\nBenjamin Karim was chosen to introduce him. As they waited in the anteroom, Karim recalls, \"it was absolutely weird. Standing there looking at him, I felt he really couldn't go any further. But he had come to a point where he still couldn't see his goal. I didn't know he was going to be assassinated, but it was like looking at a man who had been physically lifting logs, and had lifted the last log he could lift. The burden had become too much. He was very drawn. He looked like he had already begun moving out of life.\"\n\nAppearing on the platform to an explosion of cheering and applause-that familiar tall and gangling figure, his face wrapped in one of his spacious grins-he waited for silence, and then offered the Islamic greeting \" As-salaam alaikum , brothers and sisters,\" and the audience chorused in turn, \" Wa-alaikum salaam .\" At that instant, about eight rows back in the crowd below him, a man leaped to his feet crying, \"Get your hand out of my pocket!\" As heads turned and Malcolm's security guards at the foot of the platform began moving toward the distraction, Malcolm lifted both arms and called, \"Hold it! Hold it! Don't get excited. Let's cool it, brothers.\" But now a man was scrambling toward him, hunched forward over a long glint of metal. And, with Malcolm's arms still lifted in that becalming gesture, a shotgun blast blew him backward with a perfectly circular seven-inch pattern of holes over his heart. He toppled, with blood spattered across his face and shirt, down through two empty chairs to the platform, his head hitting with a loud thunk, and the shotgun, a sawed-off double-barrel twelve-gauge, blasted him again where he lay. Now two other men, in overcoats, at the foot of the platform, were clattering away at him with pistols-a 9-millimetre and a .45 automatic. \"It looked like a firing squad,\" one witness recalled. Betty, sitting near the stage with her daughters, saw the original disturbance out of the side of her vision, and when she heard the shots, she says, she had an instant certainty: \"I knew there was no one else in there they'd be shooting at.\" She turned to see Malcolm falling, and immediately threw the children under some chairs and covered them with her body. \"They never actually saw it, what had happened,\" she says.\n\nThe auditorium had become a storm of howling people floundering for cover in a tumble of chairs, some of which were flung through the air as two of the gunmen fled for the door. In a continuing clangor of gunfire, some of it now from Malcolm's guards, the two gunmen made it down the stairway to the street, but there one of them, who had been shot in the leg, was overhauled by the crowd, and came close to being beaten to death before he was claimed by hastily arriving police.\n\nMeanwhile, back inside the ballroom, Betty, crying, \"They're killing my husband!,\" attempted to rush forward to where Malcolm lay. \"I wanted to give him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but a person was holding me back,\" she says. A stretcher was finally brought from a nearby hospital, and Malcolm was borne away, his face fixed, in death, in a fierce grimace of bared teeth-almost as if he had been at last reclaimed by the old, irreconcilable rage of the Malcolm X who had been pursuing him all these many months.\n\nToday, recalling that Sunday afternoon at the Audubon Ballroom, Betty Shabazz says, \"I still carry it with me all the time. I prayed for years for it to be taken away, not to be able to remember it.\" She had even refused to take the children to the funeral, for fear \"they'd see him there prone, not moving.\" She says, \"But my consciousness expanded, so I can live with it.\" In fact, she has become, like Coretta King, the public keeper of her husband's memory. (According to her, it was Malcolm who suggested to Haley that he look into his ancestors' past in Africa-a suggestion that led to \"Roots.\")\n\nAfter Malcolm's death, Betty earned a doctoral degree in education, and she is now an administrator at Medgar Evers College, in Brooklyn. She is an imposing dowager of a woman, with a round, full face that has a stately impassiveness. During a recent conversation, she began by declaring, with a forefinger spearing upward, much in Malcolm's old preacherly manner, \"To understand Malcolm, you must understand his mission\"-which she is now constantly explaining to audiences across the country. \"He's called a racist-no, no, no! Sometimes you have to exaggerate in order to get people to see. What did he do? He held up a mirror. Sometimes you don't like what you see in a mirror.\" She added, quietly, \"When he's away, he's here. I still feel his presence. He still lives with me. The guy was so strong .\"\n\nNot long after Malcolm's death, Elijah Muhammad consented to receive the press-even those members with blue eyes and chalky skins-in a vast chamber of his mansion in Chicago. Tiny and solemn amid walls hung with white silk, he declared, in a fluting voice, \"We have not, as I said, never resorted to no such thing as violence. Way I see it, Malcolm is the victim of his own preachin'. He preached violence, and so he becomes a victim of it.\" But Peter Goldman reports that to a gathering of his believers four days later he said, between coughings and wheezings, \"He tried to make war against me. . . . It's wrong to even stand beside the grave of a hypocrite. . . . Malcolm got what he was preaching.\" Two of Malcolm's brothers were presented, to denounce him one last time as \"a man who was no good.\"\n\nThree black men-all Muslims, as it eventually proved-were arrested, and in a two-month trial nearly a year later were found guilty of the slaying and sentenced to life in prison. Two of them are now out on parole. The third, Talmadge Hayer, who was the gunman apprehended immediately outside the ballroom, confessed at the trial but declared that the two others had not been involved. They have continued to maintain that they had nothing to do with the shooting. In prison, Hayer admitted to Goldman that Malcolm's execution had been plotted by five Muslim street regulars, under the inspiration of the Muslim leadership, as retribution for the discomfort that Malcolm had afforded Elijah Muhammad. The message in comments heard by the faithful from some of Muhammad's close courtiers, such as \"If you knew what Malcolm said about the Dear Holy Apostle, you'd kill him yourself,\" was as unmistakable as Henry II's legendary complaint about Thomas Becket.\n\nNorman Butler is one of those convicted of Malcolm's murder who still denies he participated in it, but he nevertheless told Goldman that, beforehand, \"security people rolled in from everywhere-captains from all over the country. . . . And New York was made to look bad,\" and he quoted one of them as saying, \"What we got to do-bring in people from all over to take care of your business?\" These words came, Butler said, from a member of Elijah Muhammad's own household in Chicago, who elaborated, \"Cut the nigger's tongue out and put it in an envelope and send it to me, and I'll stamp it approved and give it to the Messenger.\" Butler told Goldman, \"And that, at that time, was death . Back then, that was an order .\" It was not as if defectors and apostates from the Nation of Islam hadn't been killed before, and for considerably tamer affronts than Malcolm's. Charles Kenyatta says today, \"They were nothing but a Mafia operation.\" As Elijah Muhammad's somewhat more benign son, Wallace, was later appalled to discover, at least ten believers who were simply restless about the overbearing manner of the Fruit of Islam had also been killed. All those who investigated Malcolm's assassination were convinced that, beyond the three convicted, at least one person and possibly three more people were involved.\n\nOther speculations have since swarmed: suspicions-invigorated by subsequent disclosures about police operations against other perceived menaces, like the Black Panthers-that swiftly turned into certainties about complicity by the C.I.A., the F.B.I., the New York police, or all the engines of the state combined, choreographed from Washington, and including a possible betrayal by one or several of Malcolm's own. Malcolm's film biographer, Spike Lee, has written, \"We all live in a wicked country where the government can and will do anything to keep people in check. . . . I see the F.B.I., C.I.A. and the police departments around this country as one and the same. They are all in cahoots and along with the Nation of Islam, they all played a part in the assassination of Malcolm X. Who else? King? Both Kennedys? Evers?\" It testifies to a curious superstition about the omniscience of federal agencies to maintain, as Lee does, that \"the Bureau knew Malcolm's every move, knew he was being hunted down, but stood back.\"\n\nIn reality, Malcolm was warned by the F.B.I. of threats against his life, and was assured that the F.B.I. would supply witnesses if he wished to take the Muslims to court. And he was repeatedly offered protection by New York's police. One was a formal offer of a twenty-four-hour police guard, and he had received as many as seventeen offers to station uniformed officers at his rallies at the Audubon Ballroom-offers made, to be sure, with the anticipation that Malcolm would almost certainly refuse them, as he mostly did. The only probable complicity of the F.B.I. and the police in what happened would have been that, knowing a strike at Malcolm to be almost certainly impending, they chose not to intervene any more actively to avert it.\n\nThe case for some larger official conspiracy to execute Malcolm proceeds from the supposition that at that time he presented a serious concern to the custodians of the national interest, both internally and abroad. Evidence cited for such a conspiracy includes the claim that, during a journey of Malcolm's to Cairo to try to persuade the African Unity Organization to take America's racial policy before the United Nations, he was, while staying at the Nile Hilton, \"poisoned.\" But, having partaken of the fare of Cairo, including that of the Nile Hilton, on several visits of my own there, I can say that I have been poisoned on at least two occasions myself. The truth is, the notion that the national authorities had become so hoodooed by Malcolm that they would actually engage in a plot to eliminate him rather exaggerates the perception of his threat at the time. Though he did eventually attract more interest from the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. with his transmutation from a Black Muslim isolationist into a militant advocate of a Pan-African black nationalism, that interest never seems to have ranged much further than his potential for embarrassment. What unease about black militancy had gathered in government agencies was focussed principally on King, with his incomparably larger following. Malcolm's true danger to the nation's management-that he was creating a radical new consciousness of pride and assertiveness in the nation's black community-was a phenomenon still inherently beyond the institutional imagination.\n\nTo be sure, Malcolm himself once said to Haley, \"The more I keep thinking about this thing, the things that have been happening lately, I'm not all that sure it's the Muslims. I know what they can do, and what they can't, and they can't do some of the stuff recently going on.\" Nevertheless, his expectation of assassination was fixed, for the most part, on the Muslims alone. One Muslim operation to exterminate him, he reported afterward, went awry only when one of the participants had second thoughts and came to warn him.\n\nIn the end, much of the speculation about a conspiracy arises, as in the case of Kennedy's death, from a reluctance to accept the absurd disparity that so much could have been destroyed through any circumstance so paltry and mundane. In Malcolm's case, an obscure internal religious war on the fringes of the black community seems impossibly out of proportion to his life and its meaning now. But one should always be wary of explanations that are far more arabesque and fantastical in detail than the paradoxes they're trying to explain.\n\nIn the years after Malcolm's assassination, and Elijah Muhammad's serene expiration, in 1975, Elijah's son, Wallace, diverged with some Muslims into a far milder and more conventional version of Islam, in the process quietly discarding his father's claim to have been Allah's Messenger. He even began restoring Malcolm as a venerated figure of the faith, and eventually renamed the Harlem mosque in Malcolm's honor. (There has also survived a straighter line of doctrinal descent, from Elijah Muhammad to Louis Farrakhan, who now occupies Elijah's mansion in Chicago.)\n\nBut beyond the singular personal testament of his autobiography, Malcolm, to all appearances, left little behind him that was measurable. Both of his organizations had already fallen into ramshackle disarray, on the verge of dwindling away altogether. His grand Pan-African political offensive had evaporated against the cold calculations prevailing at the United Nations. He remained little more than a kind of garish rogue figure on the edge of the ongoing surge of the civil-rights movement. But Malcolm's true epitaph has turned out to be much like a fulfillment of that old invocation of his father's great hero, Marcus Garvey: \"I shall come back to you. . . . Look for me in the whirlwind or the storm, look for me all around you.\"\n\nShortly after his death, as the civil-rights movement shifted to the urban North, speculations arose that Malcolm would become an increasingly formidable figure in the black consciousness and that King would be forced to adapt to Malcolm's message. The suggestion, though, that Martin and Malcolm were actually converging, in their widening campaigns against poverty and the dehumanization of American policies, seems ultimately illusory: they held two profoundly different understandings of humankind. King was animated by a vision of how things could and should be; Malcolm operated within a flat, rancorous acceptance of things as they were. \"This is an era of hypocrisy,\" he declaimed. \"You pretend that you're my brother and I pretend that I really believe you believe you're my brother.\"\n\nBut the duality between their visions is an abiding one, reaching beyond both Martin and Malcolm, and it has become, if anything, even more pertinent in what seems now yet another quickening of America's old racial travail. Specifically, the government's-and the society's-bland obliviousness of the plight of the poor in the last decade seems only to have placed more pressure on the racial fault line in the national community. Beyond that, there are those who have even proposed that racial turmoil may well be the coming theme of international history, as the world contracts into an ever more intimate neighborhood: that ethnic or tribal conflicts like those today in the remnants of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, in Sri Lanka and Somalia, to say nothing of the Middle East, will replace the long historical kinetic force of state nationalism and ideology and economic contention-that the real conflicts that will occupy governments and their armies will be as primitive a matter as the clashings of races.\n\nIn this country, at least, the implications of the increasing bitter estrangement of the children of Malcolm (in his latter days he noted, \"Thicker each year in these ghettos is the kind of teen-ager that I was\") can be nothing less than a deepening dissolution of the old dream of a common, egalitarian American neighborhood. To an extent, Malcolm incontestably emancipated a form of black pride: he himself claimed, with considerable fairness, that he had acted \"to revolutionize the American black man's thinking, opening his eyes until he would never again look in the same fearful, worshipful way at the white man.\" Jesse Jackson, who as a college student once drove from North Carolina to Harlem hoping to meet with Malcolm, remembers that \"he was able to cut down the enemy with his tongue-that was his excitement for black people. Martin's liberation was his public movement, opening up the system to blacks. But Malcolm's was personal-he somehow removed the fear in blacks' personal encounters with whites.\" Ossie Davis proclaimed in his eulogy at Malcolm's funeral, \"Malcolm was our manhood, our living, black manhood . . . Our own black shining prince!\" He is still hailed by many as the most authentic voice of America's vast black underclass. In this he was actually ahead of King. Virtually by his oratory alone, he helped call forth the dawning of black consciousness in America; a cultural decolonization of the black spirit.\n\nBut it has been his earlier incarnation to which his posterity has somehow clung: to Malcolm's own slayer, in effect. On book covers, and on posters that have proliferated throughout the black community-in university black-student unions and inner-city bookstores-it is the image of Malcolm during his Muslim days that glares out, in his old finger-spearing racial judgment and malediction; it is, as the myriad profusion of \"X\"s shows, still Malcolm from his Nation of Islam years. For that matter, most of Malcolm's children may now have only a dim impression of him, as a fearsome black orator who was once the nemesis of white America.\n\nIt was his own hope, he told Haley, that \"one day, history may even say that my voice-which disturbed the white man's smugness, and his arrogance, and his complacency-that my voice helped save America from a grave, possibly even a fatal catastrophe.\" But the true tragedy of Malcolm's life would be if, along with his inner emancipation of blacks, his gift to his people should also become, from that grimmer evangelism which finally claimed him in the Audubon Ballroom, the lurid liberation of their anger in the moral nihilism most recently beheld in the firestorm of Los Angeles. The rage after the acquittals of the Los Angeles police officers who had been seen on video systematically beating Rodney King was much in the spirit of the old Malcolm X. It is a matter of some irony, then, that Rodney King himself, around whom the rage of the children of Malcolm had billowed, turned out to be consummately one of the children of Martin when he appeared before cameras and, pained and stunned, ventured the appeal, in a halting, stumbling voice that yet had an eloquence beyond all the roaring of those days, \"Can we all get along?\"\n\nIt was toward that simple but ultimately civilized sentiment that Malcolm was making his last pilgrimage. He undertook it against fearful odds-odds that, after all these years, still confront his people. For the rest of us, then, the parable of Malcolm X should serve as an urgent warning. We must at last come by the recognition, the conscience, and the will to somehow make it possible for Malcolm's children-the still dispossessed descendants of America's aboriginal crime of slavery-to continue the journey that he began. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "More Money More Problems in Kenya Barris's \"#blackAF\"\n\nThink of the hashtag #blackAF as a millennial remix of mantras of self-love-\"Black is beautiful,\" \"I'm black and I'm proud.\" The phrase, printed on T-shirts and stamped on skin, has become a kind of shorthand for a politics of affirmation. But does it also veil a prickly insecurity? \"Black as fuck\" is the kind of thing an artist or a businessman might say about his work or his behavior in order to foreclose critique. After all, who is anyone to question anyone else's blackness? Employed earnestly, the phrase makes some people wary: Why the fuck do you feel that you have to proclaim your blackness? On the other hand: Why the fuck is it such big deal to you if I do?\n\nThe forty-five-year-old showrunner, producer, and writer Kenya Barris wants to be the commercial auteur of this identity paranoia. He is best known for the show \" black-ish ,\" which débuted on ABC in 2014, garnered a wave of hosannas from critics, and spawned two spinoffs. In 2018, he signed a potentially hundred-million-dollar deal with Netflix, a boon to his long-term project to make risky television about the black bourgeoisie. In \"#blackAF,\" Barris's inaugural Netflix series, he stars as Kenya, the filthy-rich creator of a successful show, called \"black-ish,\" who lives in a McMansion in Los Angeles with his six children and his lawyer wife, Joya (a very funny and liberated Rashida Jones). \"black-ish\" fans will get the most out of \"#blackAF,\" which is like its rawer, foulmouthed twin. As the Hollywood producer Tim Story, playing himself, puts it, in a brutal rib midway through the season, \" 'black-ish' seems to tap into the hearts and minds of fifty-five-year-old white women.\"\n\n\"#blackAF\" has alienated some black critics, who have argued that it simply retreads passé conversations about race and authenticity. The trap of seeking to be representative is one of the show's subjects; still, Kenya's personal dysphoria inevitably says something about the state of the black race. Non-critics seem to have a higher tolerance for the show's flaws, perhaps because it's funny. Barris isn't trying to make his magnum opus-he just wants to blow off some steam. One of the show's strengths is its filleting of stale network-sitcom character silhouettes. The Barris family is a picture of caustic dysfunction. One son is a \"pathological fucking liar\"; Kenya berates another for being \"soft.\" The youngest, a baby, toddles into the expansive kitchen and declares, \"I shit my diaper, Mommy.\" It's nothing for Kenya to call his daughter a \" THOT ,\" or for her to retort that he is a \"dick.\"\n\nKenya's garish Balenciaga tracksuits cloak a miser who worries that, in moving on up, from Inglewood to Encino, he's become a fraud, artistic and otherwise, and that he's passed the trait on to his privileged children. In \"black-ish,\" Barris sublimated his creative fear-that he was a glorified barrow boy who had benefitted from the hunger of the \"black wave\" in Hollywood-into the character of Dre, the head of the \"urban division\" at an advertising agency. In \"#blackAF,\" you wonder, and worry more than a bit, about whether Barris is acting at all.\n\nThe obvious corollary to \"#blackAF\" is \" Curb Your Enthusiasm ,\" but Barris is no Larry David , not yet-his writing doesn't do enough to distinguish the viewpoint of the show from that of its repellent protagonist. \"#blackAF\" also contains shades of \" The Bernie Mac Show \" and \"Real Husbands of Hollywood,\" Kevin Hart 's prescient, self-skewering series for BET. But Kenya's nouveau-riche anxieties belong most clearly to a broader tradition of black-male complaint: his wild swings from pomposity to soul-deadness and self-doubt recall comedians like Richard Pryor and Chris Rock , and rappers from Future to Jay-Z . His identity crisis is represented by a fat gold chain, which he makes plans to sell-\"am I a coon?\" he asks himself-but which stays on his neck all season long, an albatross.\n\nI was raised by nineties black television. UPN, Fox, and the WB were flush with sitcoms that featured black characters living in all-black worlds who didn't seem to emit a whiff of self-consciousness: \"Martin,\" \"The Wayans Bros.,\" \"Sister, Sister,\" \"Living Single,\" \"A Different World.\" It's said that only now are we living in the golden age of black film and TV, but that judgment hinges on a thirst for universal appeal. The rupture between nineties sitcoms and the current mode of autobiographical black television reflects the fact that black artists have joined the ranks of TV producers, showrunners, and writers. It also owes something to the investment of the white critical establishment in black culture. Today's satirical series can feel like extravagant forms of therapy made by power brokers who are dealing with the fact that they are no longer broke or powerless. Issa Rae has \" Insecure \"; Lena Waithe has \"Twenties,\" a fictionalization of her early life as a screenwriter. Hattie, Waithe's avatar, wants to work for the showrunner of \"My Bae,\" a series that she considers pandering and cynical. Her boss, folding her arms-a gesture of encouragement disguised as one of contempt-suggests that Hattie make her own show.\n\nWhereas \"black-ish\" was shot like a mockumentary, the framing device of \"#blackAF\" comes from Drea (Iman Benson), Kenya's second-oldest daughter and his intellectual rival. She is making a documentary about her family for her application to the film program at N.Y.U., and Kenya outfits her with a film crew. (\"They shot 'The Revenant' with less than this, O.K.?\" she says.) \"#blackAF\" is a messy show about the mess of making television; Barris's casting of some of the \"black-ish\" actors, and his recycling of the Greek-chorus motif (in the earlier show, a team of demographically diverse people at the advertising company; in the new one, a TV writers' room) gives \"#blackAF\" a television-for-television-writers appeal. Barris is responding, in part, to the curdling of the Zeitgeist since the Obama era, a period in which any art that seemed to analyze the performance of blackness was immediately deemed resonant. On each episode of \"black-ish,\" Barris used a trademark monologue to link a character's personal crisis to structural racism. In \"#blackAF,\" he parodies the speciousness of that device. \"Being dripped is literally part of who we are,\" Kenya says, unironically invoking slavery to justify his Mr. Porter addiction. The show's treatment of Juneteenth performs a similar function, reminding us of the way in which \"black-ish\" commemorated the holiday with a soaring piece of edutainment. In this series, perhaps truer to life, Juneteenth is just an excuse to drink brown liquor and bake a \"freedom cake.\"\n\nIn the fifth episode, which stands out for its surge of contained conflict, Kenya is asked to speak on a panel about a film, which he loathes, made by an up-and-coming black director. Everyone else, white and black, seems to love it. In advance of the event, he assembles a black-Hollywood counsel, including Tim Story, Will Packer, Ava DuVernay , and Issa Rae-who play themselves-over FaceTime. \"We do it all the time with white stuff,\" Kenya says, after he realizes that his peers are holding back from giving their true opinion of the film. \"Why can't we do it with our stuff?\" He is roundly dismissed by everyone except Waithe, who agrees to sit on the panel with him and to back him up on his critiques of the movie. But, when the time comes, she sells him out onstage, praising the film and babbling on about the power of representation. Barris and Waithe are impressively willing to parody themselves, but the result feels like self-defense masquerading as satire.\n\nThe other seven episodes blur into one another, lacking story or situation. I couldn't get enough of Jones as a loving, self-absorbed, rich-bitch mom, and I will never complain about a Nia Long cameo, especially one in which she's playing a hustler publicist. But \"#blackAF\" desperately needs fewer riffs and an expanded character universe to leaven its atmosphere of crushing self-indulgence. At the end of the season, Kenya has a pat, sitcom-style epiphany while watching a rerun of \"black-ish\" on a family vacation to Fiji. \"Such a good show,\" he says to himself. One kind of innocence allowed Barris to make \"black-ish.\" It was another kind that led to \"#blackAF.\" ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Blacks More Likely to Die of Severe Sepsis\n\nMar.  23 -- FRIDAY, Feb. 8 (HealthDay News) -- Black Americans are almost twice as likely to develop severe sepsis than whites and are more likely to die of severe sepsis than either whites or Hispanics, new research shows.\n\nSevere sepsis is an overwhelming infection of the bloodstream accompanied by acute organ dysfunction. The study, which analyzed data on more than 71 million people, also found that Hispanics had a lower incidence of severe sepsis than whites.\n\n\"The difference in incidence was evident by age 20 and continued throughout the adult life span. After accounting for differences in poverty and geography, black race remained independently associated with higher severe sepsis incidence,\" wrote Dr. Amber E. Barnato, of the Center for Research on Health Care at the University of Pittsburgh, and colleagues.\n\n\"Blacks do indeed have a higher rate of severe sepsis -- almost double that of whites. Some, but not all, of this increase was explained by blacks' more frequent residence in ZIP codes with higher poverty rates, suggesting that social, rather than biological determinants, such as health behavior and access to primary care, may contribute to this disparity,\" the researchers noted.\n\n\"In contrast, Hispanic ethnicity appeared to be protective, conditional on similar regional urbanicity and poverty.\" they added.\n\nThe type of hospital facilities in which patients received care was a major factor that clearly differed among the racial groups. Compared to whites, blacks were more likely to be treated at hospitals with poorer outcomes for severe sepsis.\n\n\"If a black and white patient with the same clinical characteristics were treated at the same hospital, they would have identical case survival rates,\" wrote Barnato and colleagues. \"Therefore, it may be that the hospitals that treat most black patients see black and white patients who are sicker than we can measure using these data sources, and/or that these hospitals are providing lower quality care.\"\n\nThe study was published in the first issue for February of the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine .\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "20-year-old med student hopes his book helps doctors identify conditions on dark skin\n\nMalone Mukwende recognized symptoms may look different depending on skin tone.\n\nUpon arriving at medical school at St. George's, University of London, 20-year-old Malone Mukwende was often taught to look for symptoms that only pertain to white skin.\n\nFor instance, Kawasaki disease, which is inflammation of the body's arteries and is mostly found in children, is often associated with a red rash. But as Mukwende, who is originally from Zimbabwe, sat in class, he was disturbed by the fact that a simple red rash was not how the symptom would appear on his own dark skin.\n\nIn fact, beyond Kawasaki disease, there were a whole host of images in Mukwende's textbooks and slides in his classes that didn't accurately describe the way symptoms would appear on dark skin.\n\n\"When flagging to tutors, it was clear that they didn't know of any other way to describe these conditions,\" Mukwende said. \"And I knew that I had to make a change to that.\"\n\nMukwende continued asking questions, but he was often sent to go and look for the answers himself.\n\n\"It was clear there was a major gap in the current medical education,\" he said.\n\nEnter \"Mind the Gap: A Handbook of Clinical Signs in Black and Brown Skin,\" a book Mukwende is set to publish along with two lecturers at St. George's: Dr. Peter Tamony, a senior lecturer in clinical skills who also works to improve inclusivity and diversity in medical education, and Margot Turner, a lecturer on diversity in medical education.\n\nThe three received a student-staff partnership grant and the project took off. The resource will feature images to help medical workers identify conditions on darker skin, as well as suggested language for them to adopt while describing the symptoms.\n\n\"I am excited to see the change in the curriculum and learn medicine to be able to treat a wide range of patients,\" Mukwende said of his efforts, which have come with their own set of challenges. \"Many people rejected the work initially, stating that it is common sense or it is stuff that everybody knows.\"\n\n\"I knew that I had to make a change as I wasn't happy with the way things were currently being taught,\" he said.\n\nDoctors, and especially doctors of color, have been flagging gaps in medical education for years. It appears now, underscored by the work of Mukwende, that their concerns are gaining a wider audience.\n\nThis comes as the world continues to reel from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which has shined a spotlight on the ways systemic racism has disproportionately affected health and social inequality of racial and ethnic minority groups. In the United States, Black people are dying at 2.5 times the rate of white people. They're more likely to be working front-line jobs, experience poverty, and, as a result, have the pre-existing medical conditions that lead to more dire outcomes should they contract covid-19.

      "text": "Aspiring NASCAR driver Rajah Caruth discusses his journey and why Bubba Wallace is a role model\n\nThe 18-year-old also is planning to attend Winston-Salem State University.\n\nAt 18, Rajah Caruth already has a trophy case filled with medals and awards from competitive driving, from races all over the country.\n\nHe's just getting started.\n\nThe soon-to-be Winston-Salem State University freshman already has his NASCAR license, and he has big dreams to become one of the sport's top drivers like Bubba Wallace , whom he considers a role model.\n\nBut the journey for Caruth, like for most African American drivers, hasn't been easy. Caruth didn't grow up in a racing family, had no connections and didn't know much about how to make his dream a reality. Most of what he knew about racing came from being a fan of cartoon characters like Lighting McQueen and Speed Racer.\n\nCaruth attended his first race in middle school.\n\n\"That really flipped the switch,\" he said. \"That was the point where I realized that this is what I want to do, this is what I want to put my life and my career into.\"\n\nNASCAR currently has just one Black driver in the top flight: Wallace.\n\nIn recent weeks, he's emerged as a new face of the franchise because he has \"Black Lives Matter\" on his car and initial reports of a noose found in his garage, which led to an FBI investigation .\n\nIn the wake of that story, many in the NASCAR community stepped up and supported Wallace, embracing Black Lives Matter and giving young drivers like Caruth hope for the future.\n\n\"He's been a good role model, a really good role model, and an ambassador for the sport,\" Caruth said of Wallace. \"He's been a really good person for me to look up to, just in terms of how to carry myself, online and at the racetrack, how to treat people, how to deal with criticism and just mean people.\"\n\nDuring the Honor QuikTrip 500 race at Atlanta Motor Speedway, NASCAR President Steve Phelps had drivers shut down their cars so he could read the following message over the public address system:\n\n\"The Black community and all people of color have suffered in our country, and it has taken far too long for us to hear their demands for change. Our sport must do better. Our country must do better. The time is now to listen, to understand and to stand against racism and racial injustice.\"\n\nCaruth said that while he's personally faced issues regarding his race, it's been on a \"much smaller\" scale than Wallace's battles with online trolls and attacks via social media.\n\n\"I'm definitely not going to act like, you know, I had the worst time possible, but I definitely had my fair share of interactions that were not of the positive sort,\" Caruth added.\n\nSeeing more people who look like him in and around racing, even if not behind the wheel, has been encouraging, he said.\n\n\"There aren't really many of us drivers, but there are a lot of us behind the scenes,\" said Caruth. \"It's good to be on pit road and see Mike Metcalf and Tigger and everybody on pit road, you know, people of color that you know got my back. And it's cool to see them whenever I go to a cup race.\"\n\nIn 2010, NASCAR launched its Drive for Diversity Development Program , which includes Caruth now and, previously, Wallace. And in 2017, the program hired Jusan Hamilton , the first Black race director.\n\nCaruth said he knows how to become a champion driver: \"You can't take 'no' for an answer.\"\n\n\"People will say, 'Oh, you don't have experience, or, you know, you're this, that, and the other,'\" he continued. \"You really just have to stay focused. If you know you can drive, then go show it. If you stay true to yourself and make sure you surround yourself with your family, with good people, you'll be able to do great things.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Boy booted from Cub Scouts after tense exchange with Colorado senator over gun control, race\n\nA boy was kicked out of the Cub Scouts after a tense exchange with a senator.\n\n&#151; -- An 11-year-old Cub Scout was reportedly kicked out of the program allegedly for asking a Colorado state senator some tough questions during a meeting organized by the Boy Scouts of America .\n\nAmes Mayfield was booted last week following an Oct. 9 discussion hosted by his Cub Scout den in Broomfield, Colorado, with Republican Sen. Vicki Marble, his mother, Lori Mayfield, told ABC affiliate KMGH in Denver.\n\nLori Mayfield recorded the tense exchanges between her fifth-grade son and Marble and later posted the videos on YouTube . At one point in the videos, Ames asks the Fort Collins-area senator about controversial remarks she reportedly made at a legislative meeting on poverty at the Colorado State Capitol Building in 2013.\n\n\"I was astonished that you blamed black people for poor health and poverty because of all the chicken and barbecue they eat,\" Ames says.\n\n\"I didn't; that was made up by the media,\" Marble responds in a quiet, measured tone. \"So, you want to believe it? You believe it. But that's not how it went down. I didn't do that. That was false. Get both sides of the story.\"\n\nAccording to KMGH, Marble in 2013 said, \"When you look at life expectancy, there are problems in the black race. Sickle-cell anemia is something that comes up. Diabetes is something that's prevalent in the genetic makeup, and you just can't help it.\"\n\nThe senator continued at the time, \"Although I've got to say, I've never had better barbecue and better chicken and ate better in my life than when you go down South and you, I mean, I love it. Everybody loves it.\"\n\nWhile responding to Ames' question, Marble told the Cub Scouts, \"I have a multicultural family and I'm very proud of it.\"\n\n\"I have blacks in my family. I have blacks and Mexican -- they aren't Latino, they're Mexican. I have Jew. Oh, and I have Native American too. And we talk about our genetics and what we're predisposed to so we can take care of each other, and we eat everything and we exercise,\" Marble said in the videos, later adding that her cultural background includes the \"lousy Irish,\" generating some chuckles from the audience.\n\n\"We have multicultural foods within the United States and we are very blessed to have it. And we all love it and we all eat it. And we just better figure out our genetics,\" the senator said.\n\nBut it was Ames' pointed question about gun control that got him removed from the Cub Scouts, his mother told KMGH.\n\n\"I was shocked that you co-sponsored a bill to allow domestic violence offenders to continue to own a gun,\" Ames asks Marble. \"Why on earth would you want someone who beats their wife to have access to a gun?\"\n\nAn adult facilitating the discussion then cuts off the boy, saying, \"OK, Ames, that is a really thorough question.\"\n\nLori Mayfield told KMGH her son was booted from the scouting program a few days after the meeting. Ames was just three months away from advancing to a Boy Scout, she said.\n\n\"My son was praised for [the question] during and after the meeting,\" she told KMGH in an email. \"He is heartbroken his den leader kicked him out ...

Foreman says Woodson's goals went far beyond documenting Black heritage.\n\n\"He and others noticed that there was a significant disparity in the educational system in the United States,\" Foreman said.\n\nWoodson overcame that disparity, and in 1912 became the second Black person to earn a PhD from Harvard University, and the first whose parents were slaves.\n\nWoodson's most well known book, \"Miseducation of the Negro,\" is still studied in classrooms.

      "text": "Black History Is Our History: New York City Marathon Director Remembers Trailblazing Long-Distance Runner Ted Corbitt\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nFebruary 16, 2021 / 5:57 PM EST / CBS New York\n\nNEW YORK (CBSNewYork) -- As Black History Month continues, we take a look back at a true pioneer in sports.\n\nTed Corbitt is known as \"the father of distance running,\" taking a not-so-popular sport and paving the way around so many obstacles and thousands of miles so many could follow.\n\n\"It is an inspiration. It's a spark. It's a light. It is an opening of a door. It is being a trailblazer. Those are all the things that Ted Corbitt was and is, still,\" said Ted Metellus, vice president of the New York Road Runners and director of the New York City Marathon .\n\nCorbitt, the grandson of slaves, was born on a cotton farm in South Carolina. He passed away in 2007. But as the saying goes, \"heroes get remembered, but legends never die.\"\n\nMetellus is the first Black race director of any of the World Marathon Majors and he knows how much he owes to Corbitt.\n\n\"He is history. He is legacy. He is Black excellence in its purest sense,\" said Metellus.\n\nSome may have never heard of Corbitt, but it would be hard to find a serious runner who hasn't. Every December, avid runners even participate in the annual Ted Corbitt 15K held in his honor in Central Park.\n\nSomebody once said, \"For distance running, he was like Jackie Robinson, Lou Gehrig and Bill Russell.\"\n\nThose men played popular sports at the time. Corbitt took on long distance running way before it was as popular or inclusive as it is today.\n\n\"He had faced various issues. Discrimination issues, Jim Crow type issues,\" said Gary Corbitt, Ted Corbitt's son.\n\nIn 1952, Corbitt became the first African American to represent the U.S. in the Olympic Marathon. He completed 223 marathons and ultra-marathons, winning the first Philadelphia Marathon in 1954.\n\nBut his biggest obstacles were not on the racing course.\n\n\"You look at it from a sense of perspective of what we get to do now as runners. I have the ability to travel to a race and not have to be in a white only or a Black only kind of environment,\" said Metellus. \"He had to deal with that.\"\n\n\"Actually participating in an event without having any fear or concern of verbal abuse or physical abuse while you're out there running. Completing an event and saying, 'I can go home now without a problem.' There's stories of Ted having to run extra distances to get home or needing a transport to get home or to find transport home that was safe,\" Metellus continued. \"So we've come a long way.\"\n\nCorbitt's training regimes were legendary. On four occasions, he completed 300 mile plus training weeks. That's an average of almost 43 miles a day. One marathon is 26.2 miles.\n\nIn fact, while most of us drive or take mass transit to work, Corbitt ran from Riverdale in the Bronx to lower Manhattan.\n\n\"He would do 200 mile weeks regularly, and that included running 20 miles to work and sometimes running 20 miles home. So he was experimenting with the goal of winning these races,\" said Gary Corbitt.\n\nTed Corbitt was better known for his actions than his words. But because of the paths he cleared, he became the first president of the New York Road Runners club in 1958.\n\nCorbitt helped bring the New York City Marathon to all five boroughs and invented the methods and guidelines for accurate measurement of courses.\n\nHe was a pioneer, a trailblazer, and an inspiration.\n\n\"He was out there when no one else was and said, 'You can do this as well.' And there's been many times where I was the only African American out at an event site working, and I know folks looked and said, 'Wow, there's maybe an opportunity for me to do this,'\" said Metellus.\n\n\"No different than you, Otis,\" Metellus told Livingston. \"Somebody's looking at home, watching this saying, 'I can do this as well, he looks just like me.'\"\n\n© 2021 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

      "text": "Melvin Van Peebles, godfather of Black cinema, dies at 89\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  September 22, 2021 / 11:40 PM EDT / AP\n\nMelvin Van Peebles, the groundbreaking filmmaker, playwright and musician whose work helped usher in the \"blaxploitation\" wave of the 1970s and influenced filmmakers long after, has died. He was 89.\n\nIn statement, his family said that Van Peebles, father of the actor-director Mario Van Peebles, died Tuesday evening at his home in Manhattan.\n\n\"Dad knew that Black images matter. If a picture is worth a thousand words, what was a movie worth?\" Mario Van Peebles said in a statement Wednesday. \"We want to be the success we see, thus we need to see ourselves being free. True liberation did not mean imitating the colonizer's mentality. It meant appreciating the power, beauty and interconnectivity of all people.\"\n\nSometimes called the \"godfather of modern Black cinema,\" the multitalented Van Peebles wrote numerous books and plays, and recorded several albums - playing multiple instruments and delivering rap-style lyrics. He later became a successful options trader on the stock market.\n\nBut he was best known for \"Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song,\" one of the most influential movies of its time. The low-budget, art-house film, which he wrote, produced, directed, starred in and scored, was the frenzied, hyper-sexual and violent tale of a Black street hustler on the run from police after killing white officers who were beating a Black revolutionary.\n\nWith its hard-living, tough-talking depiction of life in the ghetto, underscored by a message of empowerment as told from a Black perspective, it set the tone for a genre that turned out dozens of films over the next few years and prompted a debate over whether Black people were being recognized or exploited.\n\n\"All the films about Black people up to now have been told through the eyes of the Anglo-Saxon majority in their rhythms and speech and pace,\" Van Peebles told Newsweek in 1971, the year of the film's release.\n\n\"I could have called it 'The Ballad of the Indomitable Sweetback.' But I wanted the core audience, the target audience, to know it's for them,\" he told The Associated Press in 2003. \"So I said 'Ba-ad Asssss,' like you really say it.\"\n\nMade for around $500,000 (including $50,000 provided by Bill Cosby), it grossed $14 million at the box office despite an X-rating, limited distribution and mixed critical reviews. The New York Times, for example, accused Van Peebles of merchandizing injustice and called the film \"an outrage.\"\n\nVan Peebles, who complained fiercely to the Motion Picture Association over the X-rating, gave the film the tagline: \"Rated X by an all-white jury.\"\n\nBut in the wake of the its success, Hollywood realized an untapped audience and began churning out such box office hits as \"Shaft\" and \"Superfly\" that were also known for bringing in such top musicians as Curtis Mayfield, Marvin Gaye and Isaac Hayes to work on the soundtracks.\n\nMany of Hollywood's versions were exaggerated crime dramas, replete with pimps and drug dealers, which drew heavy criticism in both the white and Black press.\n\n\"What Hollywood did - they suppressed the political message, added caricature - and blaxploitation was born,\" Van Peebles said in 2002. \"The colored intelligentsia were not too happy about it.\"\n\nIn fact, civil rights groups like the NAACP and the Congress of Racial Equality coined the phrase \"blaxploitation\" and formed the Coalition Against Blaxploitation. Among the genre's 21st century fans was Quentin Tarantino, whose Oscar-winning \"Django Unchained\" was openly influenced by blaxploitation films and spaghetti Westerns.\n\nOn Wednesday, a younger generation of Black filmmakers mourned Van Peebles' death. Barry Jenkins, the \"Moonlight\" director, said on Twitter: \"He made the most of every second, of EVERY single damn frame.\"\n\nAfter his initial success, Van Peebles was bombarded with directing offers, but he chose to maintain his independence.\n\n\"I'll only work with them on my terms,\" he said. \"I've whipped the man's ass on his own turf. I'm number one at the box office - which is the way America measures things - and I did it on my own. Now they want me, but I'm in no hurry.\"\n\nVan Peebles then got involved on Broadway, writing and producing several plays and musicals like the Tony-nominated \"Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death\" and \"Don't Play Us Cheap.\" He later wrote the movie \"Greased Lighting\" starring Richard Pryor as Wendell Scott, the first Black race car driver.\n\nIn the 1980s, Van Peebles turned to Wall Street and options trading. He wrote a financial self-help guide entitled \"Bold Money: A New Way to Play the Options Market.\"\n\nBorn Melvin Peebles in Chicago on August 21, 1932, he would later add \"Van\" to his name. He graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University in 1953 and joined the Air Force, serving as a navigator for three years.\n\nAfter military service, he moved to Mexico and worked as a portrait painter, followed by a move to San Francisco, where he started writing short stories and making short films.\n\nVan Peebles soon went to Hollywood, but he was only offered a job as a studio elevator operator. Disappointed, he moved to Holland to take graduate courses in astronomy while also studying at the Dutch National Theatre.\n\nEventually he gave up his studies and moved to Paris, where he learned he could join the French directors' guild if he adapted his own work written in French. He quickly taught himself the language and wrote several novels.\n\nOne he made into a feature film. \"La Permission/The Story of the Three Day Pass\" was the story of an affair between a Black U.S. soldier and a French woman. It won the critic's choice award at the San Francisco film festival in 1967, and Van Peebles gained Hollywood's attention.\n\nThe following year, he was hired to direct and write the score for \"Watermelon Man,\" the tale of a white bigot (played by comic Godfrey Cambridge in white face) who wakes up one day as a Black man.\n\nWith money earned from the project, Van Peebles went to work on \"Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song.\"\n\nVan Peebles' death came just days before the New York Film Festival is to celebrate him with a 50th anniversary of \"Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song.\" Next week, the Criterion Collection is to release the box set \"Melvin Van Peebles: Essential Films.\" A revival of his play \"Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death\" is also planned to hit Broadway next year, with Mario Van Peebles serving as creative producer.\n\n© 2021 The Associated Press.

American Indian/Alaskan Native (69%), Asian (68%) and Hispanic (66%) men fell in between.\n\nThe study also showed that men of color were more likely to have melanoma diagnosed at an advanced stage, making it more difficult to treat. Even when adjusted for factors like income level and insurance coverage, Black race alone increased mortality risk compared to the White population, the study found.\n\nMelanoma causes more than 9,000 deaths per year in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CDC data also show rates of male mortality for melanoma, of all races, are more than double that of females of all races.\n\n\"We know that men may be less likely to seek medical care than women, so they can be diagnosed with melanoma at later stages,\" dermatologist and co-author of the study Ashley Wysong, founding chair of the Department of Dermatology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, said in a news release . \"However, even after accounting for later stages at diagnosis, men still have worse overall survival rates than women with melanoma, so we suspect that there are some unmeasured social, genetic, tumor-specific and potentially biological factors at play, such as hormones and the way the immune system responds to melanoma tumors.\"\n\nDr. Alix Charles, chairman of dermatology at Duly Health and Care, told CBS News, \"Unfortunately Black Americans are less likely to carry private insurance. They're less likely to be able to have access to quality healthcare in their neighborhoods and in their communities.\"\n\nIf detected early, the five-year survival rate for melanoma is 99%, according to the American Cancer Society. But that figure drops down to 32% once the melanoma has spread to other organs.\n\nWhile it has been known that skin cancer is increasing among all Americans , with specific rises in men and people of color, this is the largest study to date to look specifically at the role of race among men with melanoma.\n\n\"We hope our research can lay the foundation for future studies to determine why there's such a gap in survival rates, and to make headway to reduce these survival rate gaps,\" Wysong said.\n\nThe American Academy of Dermatology says to reduce your risk, wear sunscreen and sun-protective clothing and watch for changes to your skin.\n\n\"If you have a spot on your skin that has looked the same your whole life and suddenly the edges might look different or the color changes, if the size changes, that's an important factor,\" Dr. Maral Kibarian Skelsey, dermatologist and director of the Dermatologic Surgery Center of Washington, previously told CBS News.\n\nIt's also recommended that everyone above age 18 get an annual skin examination.\n\nDetroit Lions defensive lineman Josh Paschall was a sophomore playing for the University of Kentucky when he saw a strange mark on the bottom of his foot. It turned out to be a rare form of melanoma, and Paschall needed multiple surgeries and immunotherapy to remove it.\n\n\"If you see anything that's abnormal, get that checked out,\" he told CBS News.\n\n\"The thing that's unique about skin cancer - it's so common, but it's also so preventable,\" Dr. Elizabeth Hale, associate professor of dermatology at NYU Langone and senior vice president of the Skin Cancer Foundation previously told CBS News.\n\nAbout 90% of skin cancers are associated with sun exposure, which makes protection important, Hale added.\n\n\"We recommend a broad spectrum SPF 30 or higher, and it's important to think about sunscreen every single day. It's not just enough when going to the beach or pool because we know that some damage is cumulative,\" she says. \"When you're outside, you want to reapply every two hours - even more if you're sweating or swimming. Getting people to wear it every day is the real goal.\"\n\n- Errol Barnett contributed reporting.\n\nSara Moniuszko is a health and lifestyle reporter at CBSNews.com.

      "text": "Amid George Floyd protests, black police officers are caught between their job and their identity\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nJune 9, 2020 / 12:13 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nAbout 11.5% of full-time police officers in local departments in the United States are black, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics . More than 71% are white. Recent Census data says about 13.5% of the American population is black.\n\nAs protests over the death of George Floyd and police brutality continue, black officers are facing complicated feelings.\n\nLieutenant Greacia Herdsman, who has been with the NYPD for nearly 28 years, told CBS News correspondent Errol Barnett that she was called \"anti-cop\" by a white colleague for suggesting the officers who failed to intervene during Floyd's death should be held accountable.\n\n\"It's complex,\" Herdsman said about being a black officer right now.\n\nAt a recent protest, people came up to her asking how she felt \"being black and knowing what's happening\" and if she believes in protests.\n\n\"And I was like, 'Yes, I believe it's your right to protest peacefully. ... My son is probably here right now,'\" she recalled.\n\nLaw enforcement officials like Herdsman are trying to find a balance between their duty to their jobs and their identity as black Americans.\n\n\"I was excited to be able to say, 'I want to be a part of the protest.' I want to walk with the community,\" said Fayetteville, North Carolina Police Chief Gina V. Hawkins. \"And then we had the violence come up ... I had to do my job, which is protect the community.\"\n\nSergeant Jami Jones is one of 19 black officers out of roughly 130 people in the Decatur Police Department in Alabama.\n\n\"I think that if you don't study one's culture or know someone else's background that you're dealing with, then you can see them as a threat when they're not even a threat,\" Jones told Barnett.\n\nHe believes that does happen, he said. \"You know, there have been times when I've been out of uniform where I have been treated differently,\" he said. \"I keep those stories at home, or, you know, away from work.\"\n\nWhen he's not in uniform, he's \"just another guy,\" Jones said.\n\n\"I'm a black man first. All right? And if they've had any issues with, you know, the black race, or what they see on TV ... then they may feel threatened a little bit by just the sight of me or being in close proximity of me,\" he said.\n\nBlack officers often don't speak about what's happening in the black community with white officers, Herdsman said.\n\n\"I think it's an underlying fear of what will it mean about my relationships? Because the policing relationship can be a close one,\" she said. \"When you're on the streets, you need each other.\"\n\nJones said he believes some of his white colleagues would sympathize with him if he shared his experiences with them.\n\n\"But like I said, it's just personal preference,\" he said.\n\nIn 2016, a Pew Research study found that 92% of white officers believe the U.S. has made the necessary changes to assure equal rights for African Americans, while only 29% of their black colleagues agreed.\n\nThe same study found 86% of officers felt high-profile fatal encounters between police and black people made their jobs more difficult.\n\nHawkins acknowledged that it's challenging but said she's unwavering in her position as a black member of law enforcement.\n\n\"If they are not in this profession, who will we leave it up to?\" she said. \"It's a hard position to be in, to know what I stand for and to know what it should be like and to know what it's going to take to eradicate the ones that should not be in this uniform. ... But I need the good ones to stay strong. I need the good ones to speak up. I need the good ones to know we are going to change the world with George Floyd. So yeah, it's hard, but it was never promised to be easy.\"\n\nHawkins believes she can do more from inside the police force than outside, she said.\n\nShe also said one way to build trust is to make it mandatory for police agencies to report use of force, disciplinary actions and crime statistics. Right now, all that data is voluntary.\n\nShe said she believes local communities should decide how they want to be policed.\n\n© 2020 CBS Interactive Inc.

True liberation did not mean imitating the colonizer's mentality. It meant appreciating the power, beauty and interconnectivity of all people.\"\n\nSometimes called the \"godfather of modern Black cinema,\" the multitalented Van Peebles wrote numerous books and plays, and recorded several albums - playing multiple instruments and delivering rap-style lyrics. He later became a successful options trader on the stock market.\n\nBut he was best known for \"Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song,\" one of the most influential movies of its time. The low-budget, art-house film, which he wrote, produced, directed, starred in and scored, was the frenzied, hyper-sexual and violent tale of a Black street hustler on the run from police after killing white officers who were beating a Black revolutionary.\n\nWith its hard-living, tough-talking depiction of life in the ghetto, underscored by a message of empowerment as told from a Black perspective, it set the tone for a genre that turned out dozens of films over the next few years and prompted a debate over whether Black people were being recognized or exploited.\n\n\"All the films about Black people up to now have been told through the eyes of the Anglo-Saxon majority in their rhythms and speech and pace,\" Van Peebles told Newsweek in 1971, the year of the film's release.\n\n\"I could have called it 'The Ballad of the Indomitable Sweetback.' But I wanted the core audience, the target audience, to know it's for them,\" he told The Associated Press in 2003. \"So I said 'Ba-ad Asssss,' like you really say it.\"\n\nMade for around $500,000 (including $50,000 provided by Bill Cosby), it grossed $14 million at the box office despite an X-rating, limited distribution and mixed critical reviews. The New York Times, for example, accused Van Peebles of merchandizing injustice and called the film \"an outrage.\"\n\nVan Peebles, who complained fiercely to the Motion Picture Association over the X-rating, gave the film the tagline: \"Rated X by an all-white jury.\"\n\nBut in the wake of the its success, Hollywood realized an untapped audience and began churning out such box office hits as \"Shaft\" and \"Superfly\" that were also known for bringing in such top musicians as Curtis Mayfield, Marvin Gaye and Isaac Hayes to work on the soundtracks.\n\nMany of Hollywood's versions were exaggerated crime dramas, replete with pimps and drug dealers, which drew heavy criticism in both the white and Black press.\n\n\"What Hollywood did - they suppressed the political message, added caricature - and blaxploitation was born,\" Van Peebles said in 2002. \"The colored intelligentsia were not too happy about it.\"\n\nIn fact, civil rights groups like the NAACP and the Congress of Racial Equality coined the phrase \"blaxploitation\" and formed the Coalition Against Blaxploitation. Among the genre's 21st century fans was Quentin Tarantino, whose Oscar-winning \"Django Unchained\" was openly influenced by blaxploitation films and spaghetti Westerns.\n\nOn Wednesday, a younger generation of Black filmmakers mourned Van Peebles' death. Barry Jenkins, the \"Moonlight\" director, said on Twitter: \"He made the most of every second, of EVERY single damn frame.\"\n\nAfter his initial success, Van Peebles was bombarded with directing offers, but he chose to maintain his independence.\n\n\"I'll only work with them on my terms,\" he said. \"I've whipped the man's ass on his own turf. I'm number one at the box office - which is the way America measures things - and I did it on my own. Now they want me, but I'm in no hurry.\"\n\nVan Peebles then got involved on Broadway, writing and producing several plays and musicals like the Tony-nominated \"Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death\" and \"Don't Play Us Cheap.\" He later wrote the movie \"Greased Lighting\" starring Richard Pryor as Wendell Scott, the first Black race car driver.\n\nIn the 1980s, Van Peebles turned to Wall Street and options trading. He wrote a financial self-help guide entitled \"Bold Money: A New Way to Play the Options Market.\"\n\nBorn Melvin Peebles in Chicago on Aug. 21, 1932, he would later add \"Van\" to his name. He graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University in 1953 and joined the Air Force, serving as a navigator for three years.\n\nAfter military service, he moved to Mexico and worked as a portrait painter, followed by a move to San Francisco, where he started writing short stories and making short films.\n\nVan Peebles soon went to Hollywood, but he was only offered a job as a studio elevator operator. Disappointed, he moved to Holland to take graduate courses in astronomy while also studying at the Dutch National Theatre.\n\nEventually he gave up his studies and moved to Paris, where he learned he could join the French directors' guild if he adapted his own work written in French. He quickly taught himself the language and wrote several novels.\n\nOne he made into a feature film. \"La Permission/The Story of the Three Day Pass,\" was the story of an affair between a Black U.S. soldier and a French woman. It won the critic's choice award at the San Francisco film festival in 1967, and Van Peebles gained Hollywood's attention.\n\nThe following year, he was hired to direct and write the score for \"Watermelon Man,\" the tale of a white bigot (played by comic Godfrey Cambridge in white face) who wakes up one day as a Black man.\n\nWith money earned from the project, Van Peebles went to work on \"Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song.\"\n\nVan Peebles' death came just days before the New York Film Festival is to celebrate him with a 50th anniversary of \"Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song.\" Next week, the Criterion Collection is to release the box set \"Melvin Van Peebles: Essential Films.\" A revival of his play \"Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death\" is also planned to hit Broadway next year, with Mario Van Peebles serving as creative producer.\n\n(© Copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Black or 'Other'? Doctors may be relying on race to make decisions about your health\n\nEditor's Note: CNN's \"History Refocused\" series features surprising and personal stories from America's past to bring depth to conflicts still raging today.\n\nWhen she first learned about race correction, Naomi Nkinsi was one of five Black medical students in her class at the University of Washington.\n\nNkinsi remembers the professor talking about an equation doctors use to measure kidney function. The professor said eGFR equations adjust for several variables, including the patient's age, sex and race. When it comes to race, doctors have only two options: Black or \"Other.\"\n\nNkinsi was dumbfounded.\n\n\"It was really shocking to me,\" says Nkinsi, now a third-year medical and masters of public health student, \"to come into school and see that not only is there interpersonal racism between patients and physicians ... there's actually racism built into the very algorithms that we use.\"\n\nAt the heart of a controversy brewing in America's hospitals is a simple belief, medical students say: Math shouldn't be racist.\n\nThe argument over race correction has raised questions about the scientific data doctors rely on to treat people of color. It's attracted the attention of Congress and led to a big lawsuit against the NFL.\n\nWhat happens next could affect how millions of Americans are treated.\n\nCarolyn Roberts, a historian of medicine and science at Yale University, says slavery and the American medical system were in a codependent relationship for much of the 19th century and well into the 20th .\n\n\"They relied on one another to thrive,\" Roberts says.\n\nIt was common to test experimental treatments first on Black people so they could be given to White people once proven safe. But when the goal was justifying slavery, doctors published articles alleging substantive physical differences between White and Black bodies - like Dr. Samuel Cartwright's claim in 1851 that Black people have weaker lungs, which is why grueling work in the fields was essential (his words) to their progress.\n\nThe effects of Cartwright's falsehood, and others like it, linger today.\n\nIn 2016, researchers asked White medical students and residents about 15 alleged differences between Black and White bodies. Forty percent of first-year medical students and 25% of residents said they believed Black people have thicker skin, and 7% of all students and residents surveyed said Black people have less sensitive nerve endings. The doctors-in-training who believed these myths - and they are myths - were less likely to prescribe adequate pain medication to Black patients.\n\nTo fight this kind of bias, hospitals urge doctors to rely on objective measures of health. Scientific equations tell physicians everything from how well your kidneys are working to whether or not you should have a natural birth after a C-section. They predict your risk of dying during heart surgery, evaluate brain damage and measure your lung capacity.\n\nBut what if these equations are also racially biased?\n\nRace correction is the use of a patient's race in a scientific equation that can influence how they are treated. In other words, some diagnostic algorithms and risk predictor tools adjust or \"correct\" their results based on a person's race.\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine article \" Hidden in Plain Sight \" includes a partial list of 13 medical equations that use race correction. Take the Vaginal Birth After Cesarean calculator, for example. Doctors use this calculator to predict the likelihood of a successful vaginal delivery after a prior C-section. If you are Black or Hispanic, your score is adjusted to show a lower chance of success. That means your doctor is more likely to encourage another C-section, which could put you at risk for blood loss, infection and a longer recovery period.\n\nCartwright, the racist doctor from the 1800s, also developed his own version of a tool called the spirometer to measure lung capacity. Doctors still use spirometers today, and most include a race correction for Black patients to account for their supposedly shallower breaths.\n\nTurns out, second-year medical student Carina Seah wryly told CNN, math is as racist as the people who make it.\n\nThe biggest problem with using race in medicine? Race isn't a biological category. It's a social one.\n\n\"It's based on this idea that human beings are naturally divided into these big groups called races,\" says Dorothy Roberts, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Pennsylvania, who has made challenging race correction in medicine her life's work. \"But that's not what race is. Race is a completely invented social category. The very idea that human beings are divided into races is a made-up idea.\"\n\nAncestry is biological. Where we come from - or more accurately, who we come from - impacts our DNA. But a patient's skin color isn't always an accurate reflection of their ancestry.\n\nLook at Tiger Woods, Roberts says. Woods coined the term \"Cablinasian\" to describe his mix of Caucasian, Black, American Indian and Asian ancestries. But to many Americans, he's Black.\n\n\"You can be half Black and half White in this country and you are Black,\" says Seah, who is getting her medical degree and a PhD in genetics and genomics at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. \"You can be a quarter Black in this country - if you have dark skin, you are Black.\"\n\nSo it can be misleading, Seah says, even dangerous, for doctors to judge a patient's ancestry by glancing at their skin. A patient with a White mother and Black father could have a genetic mutation that typically presents in patients of European ancestry, Seah says, but a doctor may not think to test for it if they only see Black skin.\n\n\"You have to ask, how Black is Black enough?\" Nkinsi asks. And there's another problem, she says, with using a social construct like race in medicine. \"It also puts the blame on the patient, and it puts the blame on the race itself. Like being Black is inherently the cause of these diseases.\"\n\nAfter she learned about the eGFR equation in 2018, Nkinsi began asking questions about race correction. She wasn't alone - on social media she found other students struggling with the use of race in medicine. In the spring of 2020, following a first-year physiology lecture, Seah joined the conversation. But the medical profession is nothing if not hierarchical; Nkinsi and Seah say students are encouraged to defer to doctors who have been practicing for decades.\n\nThen on May 25, 2020, George Floyd was killed by police in Minneapolis.\n\nHis death and the growing momentum around Black Lives Matter helped ignite what Dr. Darshali A. Vyas calls an \"overdue reckoning\" in the medical community around race and race correction. A few institutions had already taken steps to remove race from the eGFR equation. Students across the country demanded more, and hospitals began to listen.\n\nFour days after Floyd's death, the University of Washington announced it was removing race correction from the eGFR equation. In June, the Boston-based hospital system Mass General Brigham where Vyas is a second-year Internal Medicine resident followed suit. Seah and a fellow student at Mount Sinai, Paloma Orozco Scott, started an online petition and collected over 1600 signatures asking their hospital to do the same.\n\nStudies show removing race from the eGFR equation will change how patients at those hospitals are treated. Researchers from Brigham and Women's Hospital and Penn Medicine estimated up to one in every three Black patients with kidney disease would have been reclassified if the race multiplier wasn't applied in earlier calculations, with a quarter going from stage 3 to stage 4 CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease).\n\nThat reclassification is good and bad, says Dr. Neil Powe, chief of medicine at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. Black patients newly diagnosed with kidney disease will be able to see specialists who can devise better treatment plans. And more patients will be placed on kidney transplant lists.\n\nOn the flip side, Powe says, more African Americans diagnosed with kidney disease means fewer who are eligible to donate kidneys, when there's already a shortage. And a kidney disease diagnosis can change everything from a patient's diabetes medication to their life insurance costs.\n\nPowe worries simply eliminating race from these equations is a knee-jerk response - one that may exacerbate health disparities instead of solve them. For too long, Powe says, doctors had to fight for diversity in medical studies.\n\nThe most recent eGFR equation, known as the CKD-EPI equation , was developed using data pooled from 26 studies, which included almost 3,000 patients who self-identified as Black. Researchers found the equation they were developing was more accurate for Black patients when it was adjusted by a factor of about 1.2. They didn't determine exactly what was causing the difference in Black patients, but their conclusion is supported by other research that links Black race and African ancestry with higher levels of creatinine, a waste product filtered by the kidneys.\n\nPut simply: In the eGFR equation, researchers used race as a substitute for an unknown factor because they think that factor is more common in people of African descent.\n\nLast August, Vyas co-authored the \"Hidden in Plain Sight\" article about race correction. Vyas says most of the equations she wrote about were developed in a similar way to the eGFR formula: Researchers found Black people were more or less likely to have certain outcomes  and decided race was worth including in the final equation, often without knowing the real cause of the link.\n\n\"When you go back to the original studies that validated (these equations), a lot of them did not provide any sort of rationale for why they include race, which I think is appalling.\" That's what's most concerning, Vyas says - \"how willing we are to believe that race is relevant in these ways.\"\n\nVyas is clear she isn't calling for race-blind medicine. Physicians cannot ignore structural racism, she says, and the impact it has on patients' health.\n\nPowe has been studying the racial disparities in kidney disease for more than 30 years. He can spout the statistics easily: Black people are three times more likely to suffer from kidney failure, and make up more than 35% of patients on dialysis in the US. The eGFR equation, he says, did not cause these disparities - they existed long before the formula.\n\n\"We want to cure disparities, let's go after the things that really matter, some of which may be racist,\" he says. \"But to put all our stock and think that the equation is causing this is just wrong because it didn't create those.\"\n\nIn discussions about removing race correction, Powe likes to pose a question: Instead of normalizing to the \"Other\" group in the eGFR equation, as many of these hospitals are doing, why don't we give everyone the value assigned to Black people? By ignoring the differences researchers saw, he says, \"You're taking the data on African Americans, and you're throwing it in the trash.\"\n\nPowe is co-chair of a joint task force set up by the National Kidney Foundation and the American Society of Nephrology to look at the use of race in eGFR equations. The leaders of both organizations have publicly stated race should not be included in equations used to estimate kidney function. On April 9, the task force released an interim report that outlined the challenges in identifying and implementing a new equation that's representative of all groups. The group is expected to issue its final recommendations for hospitals this summer.\n\nRace correction is used to assess the kidneys and the lungs. What about the brain?\n\nIn 2013, the NFL settled a class-action lawsuit brought by thousands of former players and their families that accused the league of concealing what it knew about the dangers of concussions. The NFL agreed to pay $765 million, without admitting fault, to fund medical exams and compensate players for concussion-related health issues, among other things. Then in 2020, two retired players sued the NFL for allegedly discriminating against Black players who submitted claims in that settlement.\n\nThe players, Najeh Davenport and Kevin Henry, said the NFL race-corrected their neurological exams, which prevented them from being compensated.\n\nAccording to court documents, former NFL players being evaluated for neurocognitive impairment were assumed to have started with worse cognitive function if they were Black. So if a Black player and a White player received the exact same scores on a battery of thinking and memory tests, the Black player would appear to have suffered less impairment. And therefore, the lawsuit stated, would be less likely to qualify for a payout.\n\nRace correction is common in neuropsychology using something called Heaton norms, says Katherine Possin, an associate professor at the University of California San Francisco. Heaton norms are essentially benchmark average scores on cognitive tests.\n\nHere's how it works: To measure the impact of a concussion (or multiple concussions over time), doctors compare how well the patient's brain works now to how well it worked before.\n\n\"The best way to get that baseline was to test you 10 years ago, but that's not something we obviously have for many people,\" Possin says. So doctors estimate your \"before\" abilities using an average score from a group of healthy individuals, and adjust that score for demographic factors known to affect brain function, like your age.\n\nHeaton norms adjust for race, Possin says, because race has been linked in studies to lower cognitive scores. To be clear, that's not because of any biological differences in Black and White brains, she says; it's because of social factors like education and poverty that can impact cognitive development. And this is where the big problem lies.\n\nIn early March, a judge in Pennsylvania dismissed the players' lawsuit and ordered a mediator to address concerns about how race correction was being used. In a statement to CNN, the NFL said there is no merit to the players' claim of discrimination, but it is committed to helping find alternative testing techniques that do not employ race-based norms.\n\nThe NFL case, Possin wrote in JAMA , has \"exposed a major weakness in the field of neuropsychology: the use of race-adjusted norms as a crude proxy for lifelong social experience.\"\n\nThis happens in nearly every field of medicine. Race is not only used as a poor substitute for genetics and ancestry, it's used as a substitute for access to health care, or lifestyle factors like diet and exercise, socioeconomic status and education. It's no secret that racial disparities exist in all of these. But there's a danger in using race to talk about them, Yale historian Carolyn Roberts says.\n\nRelated article This device is crucial in the fight against Covid. It may not work on dark skin\n\nWe know, for example, that Black Americans have been disproportionally affected by Covid-19. But it's not because Black bodies respond differently to the virus. It's because, as Dr. Anthony Fauci has noted , a disproportionate number of Black people have jobs that put them at higher risk and have less access to quality health care. \"What are we making scientific and biological when it actually isn't?\" Roberts asks.\n\nVyas says using race as a proxy for these disparities in clinical algorithms can also create a vicious cycle.\n\n\"There's a risk there, we argue, of simply building these into the system and almost accepting them as fact instead of focusing on really addressing the root causes,\" Vyas says. \"If we systematize these existing disparities ... we risk ensuring that these trends will simply continue.\"\n\nNearly everyone on both sides of the race correction controversy agrees that race isn't an accurate, biological measure. Yet doctors and researchers continue to use it as a substitute. Math shouldn't be racist, Nkinsi says, and it shouldn't be lazy.\n\n\"We're saying that we know that this race-based medicine is wrong, but we're going to keep doing it because we simply don't have the will or the imagination or the creativity to think of something better,\" Nkinsi says. \"That is a slap in the face.\"\n\nShortly after Vyas' article published in The New England Journal of Medicine, the House Ways and Means Committee sent letters to several professional medical societies requesting information on the misuse of race in clinical algorithms. In response to the lawmakers' request, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality is also gathering information on the use of race-based algorithms in medicine. Recently, a note appeared on the Maternal Fetal Medicine Units Network's website for the Vaginal Birth After Cesarean equation - a new calculator that doesn't include race and ethnicity is being developed.\n\nThe Capitol riot was an eerie repeat of a tense era in American history How the KKK's failures became lessons for White Power This 15-year-old was the original Rose Parks Doctors may be relying on race to make decisions about your health\n\nThe Capitol riot was an eerie repeat of a tense era in American history How the KKK's failures became lessons for White Power This 15-year-old was the original Rose Parks Doctors may be relying on race to make decisions about your health\n\nDorothy Roberts is excited to see change on the horizon. But she's also a bit frustrated. The harm caused by race correction is something she's been trying to tell doctors about for years.\n\n\"I've taught so many audiences about the meaning of race and the history of racism in America and the audiences I get the most resistance from are doctors,\" Roberts says. \"They're offended that there would be any suggestion that what they do is racist.\"\n\nNkinsi and Seah both encountered opposition from colleagues in their fight to change the eGFR equation. Several doctors interviewed for this story argued the change in a race-corrected scores is so small, it wouldn't change clinical decisions.\n\nIf that's the case, Vyas wonders, why include race at all?\n\n\"It all comes from the desire for one to dominate another group and justify it,\" says Roberts. \"In the past, it was slavery, but the same kinds of justifications work today to explain away all the continued racial inequality that we see in America... It is mass incarceration. It's huge gaps in health. It's huge differences in income and wealth.\"\n\nIt's easier, she says, to believe these are innate biological differences than to address the structural racism that caused them.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Panel of South Carolina black voters give their take on Democratic race\n\nA group of black Democratic voters from South Carolina shared their thoughts on the 2020 Democratic field with CNN ahead of the state's primary in late February.\n\n\"The bottom line, in simple terms, we want to elect a Democratic candidate that can beat Trump,\" Cassandra Williams Rush told CNN's Alisyn Camerota during a voter panel segment that aired Friday.\n\nA recent Washington Post-Ipsos poll showed former Vice President Joe Biden with a double digit lead among black Democratic voters, and the six panelists acknowledged Biden's foreign policy experience, electability, and tenure in the Obama administration.\n\nBut of the six voters who spoke to CNN, only one raised his hand when asked if they'd vote for Biden in the primary.\n\n\"Biden is the person I think that will pull in white voters, black voters, men, women. He's that candidate,\" Darion McCloud of Columbia, the lone Biden supporter, said when asked why Biden appeals to black voters.\n\nTwo of the panelists said they planned to vote for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Another panelist, Jennifer Winston of Charleston, said she's leaning toward Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders because of how he's addressed college tuition and student loans.\n\nAsked about Pete Buttigieg, who's been polling low with black voters, McCloud said the former mayor is short of experience, but a \"gifted politician.\"\n\n\"He's got some well-publicized issues with the black community. I don't know if he can right that mid-campaign,\" he added.\n\nWilliams Rush, who's from Williamsburg County, is leaning toward California billionaire Tom Steyer because of his environmental standpoints. Alex Belk, a undecided voter from Columbia, South Carolina, said he also likes Steyer's philanthropy efforts.\n\nCharleston native Vanity Deterville said she feels like Steyer has pander to the black vote, citing his use of a HBCU marching band at Charleston County Democratic Party's annual Blue Jamboree.\n\n\"I thought that the notion was disingenuous and ever since then it's put a bad taste in my mouth,\" she said.\n\nAs the race gets closer to the primaries, the thinning field of candidates has become less and less diverse, with Sen. Cory Booker the latest person of color to drop out. One of the panelists said it was \"insulting\" to suggest that black voters vote for black candidates because of race.\n\n\"We don't agree with you just because of the color of your skin. That's one thing America has to understand about the black race. ... It's almost like you're saying we don't have our own ideas and views, which we do, beyond race,\" Belk said.\n\n\"I need to see that you're thinking about me, and I need a candidate who can speak to race, not just class,\" another panelist, Benny Starr of Columbia, told CNN.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Former NBA player and analyst Stephen Jackson defends DeSean Jackson's anti-Semitic posts, promotes Jewish stereotypes\n\nFormer NBA player and analyst Stephen Jackson perpetuated Jewish stereotypes and conspiracy theories while defending anti-Semitic posts made by Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver DeSean Jackson .\n\nDeSean Jackson on Tuesday apologized for posting a quote on Instagram that he attributed to Adolf Hitler saying Jewish people will \"blackmail\" and \"extort\" America. The Eagles denounced the post, calling it \"appalling,\" but did not punish DeSean.\n\nLater on Tuesday, Stephen Jackson, who had been highly involved in Black Lives Matter protests and racial justice following the death of his friend George Floyd in Minnesota, said DeSean was \"speaking the truth.\"\n\n\"So I just read a statement that the Philadelphia Eagles posted regarding DeSean Jackson's comments,\" Stephen Jackson said in a video on Instagram, according to ESPN . \"He was trying to educate himself, educate people, and he's speaking the truth. Right? He's speaking the truth. You know he don't hate nobody, but he's speaking the truth of the facts that he knows and trying to educate others.\"\n\n\"But y'all don't want us to educate ourselves. If it's talking about the Black race, y'all ain't saying nothing about it. They killing us, police killing us, and treating us like s---, racism at an all-time high, but ain't none of you NFL owners spoke up on that, ain't none of you teams spoke up on that.\"\n\nJackson referred to former Eagles wide receiver Riley Cooper, who was caught on camera using the n-word in 2013. The Eagles fined Cooper, but he later got a contract extension with the Eagles in 2014.\n\nJackson later deleted the video but posted to Instagram appearing to respond to the backlash.\n\nProud Black Man Speaking.

Jackson said he didn't support DeSean Jackson's message or Hitler, and that he was trying to show a difference in the Eagles' response to DeSean Jackson versus Riley Cooper.\n\n\"You want me to denounce Hitler? F--- Hitler,\" Jackson said.\n\nHowever, Jackson then perpetuated Jewish stereotypes, saying that Jewish people control the banks. When his co-host on the Instagram Live said Jewish people aren't trying to divide the Black community, Jackson responded, \"You know that for a fact?\"\n\n\"You know who the Rothschilds are? They control all the banks. They own all the banks,\" Jackson said.\n\nWhen the co-host said that the Rothschilds aren't reflective of the entire Jewish community, Jackson said, \"That's correlated to money. I haven't said one thing that's not true yet.\"\n\nWhen the co-host argued that Jackson could denounce the idea that the Jewish community is trying to divide the Black community, Jackson continually responded that it wasn't his \"job\" to say what other people want.\n\nJackson, who has appeared frequently on ESPN and hosts a podcast run by Showtime, was criticized in the sports media world for perpetuating stereotypes. Many felt that the important work Jackson did in the wake of Floyd's death was hurt by his comments on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\n\"Stephen Jackson, I think his passion, his heart is in the right place, but he's veering away from what the ultimate goal is,\" ESPN's Stephen A. Smith said.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Blacks struggle with 72 percent unwed mothers rate\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nOne recent day at Dr. Natalie Carroll's OB-GYN practice, located inside a low-income apartment complex tucked between a gas station and a freeway, 12 pregnant black women come for consultations. Some bring their children or their mothers. Only one brings a husband.\n\nThings move slowly here. Women sit shoulder-to-shoulder in the narrow waiting room, sometimes for more than an hour. Carroll does not rush her mothers in and out. She wants her babies born as healthy as possible, so Carroll spends time talking to the mothers about how they should care for themselves, what she expects them to do - and why they need to get married.\n\nSeventy-two percent of black babies are born to unmarried mothers today, according to government statistics. This number is inseparable from the work of Carroll, an obstetrician who has dedicated her 40-year career to helping black women.\n\n\"The girls don't think they have to get married. I tell them children deserve a mama and a daddy. They really do,\" Carroll says from behind the desk of her office, which has cushioned pink-and-green armchairs, bars on the windows, and a wooden \"LOVE\" carving between two African figurines. Diamonds circle Carroll's ring finger.\n\nAs the issue of black unwed parenthood inches into public discourse, Carroll is among the few speaking boldly about it. And as a black woman who has brought thousands of babies into the world, who has sacrificed income to serve Houston's poor, Carroll is among the few whom black women will actually listen to.\n\n\"A mama can't give it all. And neither can a daddy, not by themselves,\" Carroll says. \"Part of the reason is because you can only give that which you have. A mother cannot give all that a man can give. A truly involved father figure offers more fullness to a child's life.\"\n\nStatistics show just what that fullness means. Children of unmarried mothers of any race are more likely to perform poorly in school, go to prison, use drugs, be poor as adults, and have their own children out of wedlock.\n\nThe black community's 72 percent rate eclipses that of most other groups: 17 percent of Asians, 29 percent of whites, 53 percent of Hispanics and 66 percent of Native Americans were born to unwed mothers in 2008, the most recent year for which government figures are available. The rate for the overall U.S. population was 41 percent.\n\nThis issue entered the public consciousness in 1965, when a now famous government report by future senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan described a \"tangle of pathology\" among blacks that fed a 24 percent black \"illegitimacy\" rate. The white rate then was 4 percent.\n\nMany accused Moynihan, who was white, of \"blaming the victim:\" of saying that black behavior, not racism, was the main cause of black problems. That dynamic persists. Most talk about the 72 percent has come from conservative circles; when influential blacks like Bill Cosby have spoken out about it, they have been all but shouted down by liberals saying that a lack of equal education and opportunity are the true root of the problem.\n\n'Nobody talks about it' Even in black churches, \"nobody talks about it,\" Carroll says. \"It's like some big secret.\" But there are signs of change, of discussion and debate within and outside the black community on how to address the growing problem.\n\nResearch has increased into links between behavior and poverty, scholars say. Historically black Hampton University recently launched a National Center on African American Marriages and Parenting. There is a Marry Your Baby Daddy Day, founded by a black woman who was left at the altar, and a Black Marriage Day, which aims \"to make healthy marriages the norm rather than the exception.\"\n\nIn September, Princeton University and the liberal Brookings Institution released a collection of \"Fragile Families\" reports on unwed parents. And an online movement called \"No Wedding No Womb\" ignited a fierce debate that included strong opposition from many black women.\n\n\"There are a lot of sides to this,\" Carroll says. \"Part of our community has lost its way.\"\n\nThere are simple arguments for why so many black women have children without marriage.\n\nThe legacy of segregation, the logic goes, means blacks are more likely to attend inferior schools. This creates a high proportion of blacks unprepared to compete for jobs in today's economy, where middle-class industrial work for unskilled laborers has largely disappeared.\n\nThe drug epidemic sent disproportionate numbers of black men to prison, and crushed the job opportunities for those who served their time. Women don't want to marry men who can't provide for their families, and welfare laws created a financial incentive for poor mothers to stay single.\n\nIf you remove these inequalities, some say, the 72 percent will decrease.\n\n\"It's all connected. The question should be, how has the black family survived at all?\" says Maria Kefalas, co-author of \"Promises I Can Keep: Why Poor Women Put Motherhood Before Marriage.\"\n\nThe book is based on interviews with 162 low-income single mothers. One of its conclusions is that these women see motherhood as one of life's most fulfilling roles - a rare opportunity for love and joy, husband or no husband.\n\n'My children are what keep me going' Sitting in Carroll's waiting room, Sherhonda Mouton watches all the babies with the tender expression of a first-time mother, even though she's about to have her fourth child. Inside her purse is a datebook containing a handwritten ode to her children, titled \"One and Only.\" It concludes:\n\n\"You make the hardest tasks seem light with everything you do.\n\n\"How blessed I am, how thankful for my one and only you.\"\n\nMouton, 30, works full time as a fast-food manager on the 3 p.m. to 1 a.m. shift. She's starting classes to become a food inspector.\n\n\"My children are what keep me going, every day,\" she says. \"They give me a lot of hope and encouragement.\" Her plans for them? \"College, college, college.\"\n\nOn Mouton's right shoulder, the name of her oldest child, Zanevia, is tattooed around a series of scars. When Zanevia was an infant, Mouton's drug-addled fiance came home one night and started shooting. Mouton was hit with six bullets; Zanevia took three and survived.\n\n\"This man was the love of my life,\" Mouton says. He's serving a 60-year sentence. Another man fathered her second and third children; Mouton doesn't have good things to say about him. The father of her unborn child? \"He's around. He helps with all the kids.\"\n\nShe does not see marriage in her future.\n\n\"It's another obligation that I don't need,\" Mouton says. \"A good man is hard to find nowadays.\"\n\nMouton thinks it's a good idea to encourage black women to wait for marriage to have children. However, \"what's good for you might not be good for me.,\" Yes, some women might need the extra help of a husband. \"I might do a little better, but I'm doing fine now. I'm very happy because of my children.\"\n\n\"I woke up today at six o'clock,\" she says. \"My son was rubbing my stomach, and my daughter was on the other side. They're my angels.\"\n\n'I want better for us' Christelyn Karazin has four angels of her own. She had the first with her boyfriend while she was in college; they never married. Her last three came after she married another man and became a writer and homemaker in an affluent Southern California suburb.\n\nIn September, Karazin, who is black, marshaled 100 other writers and activists for the online movement No Wedding No Womb, which she calls \"a very simplified reduction of a very complicated issue.\"\n\n\"I just want better for us,\" Karazin says. \"I have four kids to raise in this world. It's about what kind of world do we want.\"\n\n\"We've spent the last 40 years discussing the issues of how we got here. How much more discussion, how many more children have to be sacrificed while we still discuss?\"\n\nThe reaction was swift and ferocious. She had many supporters, but hundreds of others attacked NWNW online as shallow, anti-feminist, lacking solutions, or a conservative tool. Something else about Karazin touched a nerve: She's married to a white man and has a book about mixed-race relationships coming out.\n\nBlogger Tracy Clayton, who posted a vicious parody of NWNW's theme song, said the movement focuses on the symptom instead of the cause.\n\n\"It's trying to kill a tree by pulling leaves off the limbs. And it carries a message of shame,\" said Clayton, a black woman born to a single mother. \"I came out fine. My brother is married with children. (NWNW) makes it seem like there's something immoral about you, like you're contributing to the ultimate downfall of the black race. My mom worked hard to raise me, so I do take it personally.\"\n\nDemetria Lucas, relationships editor at Essence, the magazine for black women, declined an invitation for her award-winning personal blog to endorse NWNW. Lucas, author of the forthcoming book \"A Belle in Brooklyn: Advice for Living Your Single Life & Enjoying Mr. Right Now,\" says plenty of black women want to be married but have a hard time finding suitable black husbands.\n\n70 percent of professsional black women are unmarried Lucas says 42 percent of all black women and 70 percent of professional black women are unmarried. \"If you can't get a husband, who am I to tell you no, you can't be a mom?\" she asks. \"A lot of women resent the idea that you're telling me my chances of being married are like 1 in 2, it's a crapshoot right now, but whether I can have a family of my own is based on whether a guy asks me to marry him or not.\"\n\nMuch has been made of the lack of marriageable black men, Lucas says, which has created the message that \"there's no real chance of me being married, but because some black men can't get their stuff together I got to let my whole world fall apart. That's what the logic is for some women.\"\n\nThat logic rings false to Amy Wax, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, whose book \"Race, Wrongs and Remedies: Group Justice in the 21st Century\" argues that even though discrimination caused blacks' present problems, only black action can cure them.\n\n\"The black community has fallen into this horribly dysfunctional equilibrium\" with unwed mothers, Wax says in an interview. \"It just doesn't work.\"\n\n\"Blacks as a group will never be equal while they have this situation going on, where the vast majority of children do not have fathers in the home married to their mother, involved in their lives, investing in them, investing in the next generation.\"\n\n\"The 21st century for the black community is about building human capital,\" says Wax, who is white. \"That is the undone business. That is the unmet need. That is the completion of the civil rights mission.\"\n\n'You owe them something better than you got' All the patients are gone now from Carroll's office - the prison guard, the young married couple, the 24-year-old with a 10-year-old daughter and the father of her unborn child in jail. The final patient, an 18-year-old who dropped out of college to have her first child, departs by taxi, alone.\n\n\"I can't tell you that I feel deep sadness, because I don't,\" says Carroll, who has two grown children of her own. \"And not because I'm not fully aware of what's happening to them. It's because I do all that I can to help them help themselves.\"\n\nCarroll is on her second generation of patients now, delivering the babies of her babies. She does not intend to stop anytime soon. Her father, a general practitioner in Houston, worked right up until he died.\n\nEach time she brings a child into this world, she thinks about what kind of life it will have.\n\n\"I tell the mothers, if you decide to have a baby, you decide to have a different kind of life because you owe them something. You owe them something better than you got.\"\n\n\"I ask them, what are you doing for your children? Do you want them to have a better life than you have? And if so, what are you going to do about it?\"\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Hayden Swank, called a race car driving wunderkind, navigates college and racism\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nA year ago, Hayden Swank sold his beloved car so he could drive faster cars.\n\nThe 19-year-old was running out of money to support his fledgling career in race car driving that he hopes will one day land him a spot in NASCAR. So he did the unfathomable for a teenager and unloaded his 2004 Mercury Grand Marquis.\n\nFrom the Atlanta-area town of Woodstock, Swank has been considered by many a wunderkind of race car driving. So far, he has racked up more than 20 wins since he first eased behind a steering wheel of a quarter midget car when he was 7 years old.\n\nFulfilling his promise, though, was precarious until he and his team gained sponsorships from Overtime, the sports brand and basketball league, and the men's grooming brand Old Spice.\n\nThe relief Swank felt was palpable, played out during an enlightening eight-part Overtime series called Race that chronicles his challenges and triumphs, from financial concerns to car malfunctions, to dealing with volatile fans and opposition, to his parents' support, to balancing college and racing.\n\n\"This sport has a history that is not diverse,\" said Swank, who is studying business at the University of Georgia. \"The sport has a lot of work to do. I have accepted that. My job is not to win people over, just to win races.\"\n\nNot that anything has come easy. The teenager said he has heard his fair share of ugly remarks from drivers and teams, as well as fans. In the Overtime series, a crew member urged him not to reveal his face - and racial identity - before a race: \"Don't not take off your helmet, no matter what.\"\n\nPoised and thoughtful, Swank said participating in a sport that has historically had very few Black drivers at the highest level of the profession - Bubba Wallace follows Wendell Scott, who broke NASCAR's race barrier in the 1960s - tests his patience, but grows his resolve.\n\n\"I cope,\" he said. \"When I show up, I'm not only the only mixed or Black person racing, but I'm the only minority in the whole place of maybe 2,000 people. So, sure, I feel like an outsider, like I don't belong. There's added pressure.\n\n\"Some people claim I'm there because I'm a token, that we paid our way. That's not close to true. For the most part, I think they respect me. But there are a few drivers I won't be friends with. And there are certain tracks that are not fans of mine. But I accept it.\"\n\nIn 2004, NASCAR instituted the NASCAR Diversity Pit Crew Internship Program, which has produced at least 55 Black graduates working in NASCAR, including Brehanna Daniels. The former basketball player at the historically Black Norfolk State University made history in 2018 as the first Black woman to work on a pit crew in NASCAR's top series.\n\nDaniels excelled and  in 2019 she became the first African American woman to serve on a pit crew at the Daytona 500.\n\nRaynard Revels II, also a Norfolk State graduate, took advantage of the Drive for Diversity Program in 2019 and has used the last two years to work as a pit crew member for hire as he seeks to elevate onto a premier team. The former linebacker for the football team who lives in Charlotte had never been to a NASCAR race before entering the program.\n\nBlack men who worked or work in pit crews - Dion \"Rocko\" Williams, Phil Horton, Ernest Holden and Lamar Neal - serve as either mentors or a support system for Revels.\n\n\"It's a predominantly white sport, but I look at it as being on a team,\" Revels, 27, said. \"And when you're on a team, you do all you can to win.\"\n\nOther HBCUs like Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte are encouraging students to pursue a career in the sport. And while the efforts have worked out for Davis and others, there are still only three nonwhite drivers: Wallace, who is Black, Kyle Larson, who is Japanese American, and Daniel Suárez, who is Mexican.\n\nLast summer, the world Swank wants to compete in came into full light during the Black Lives Matter demonstrations. Wallace had publicly supported BLM and called for the removal of Confederate flags at races. Soon after, a noose was found hanging in his garage at Talladega Raceway in Alabama - a clear threat that harkens to the days when Black people were openly lynched.\n\nAn FBI investigation found that the rope may have looked like a noose, it was actually a garage pull rope. By then, the drivers had lined up behind Wallace on pit road as a show of solidarity.\n\nMahogany Boss, a Black woman who said she loves NASCAR and used to race cars in low-level competition, said she \"definitely experienced racism at the track. There have been moments when I lashed back out, and moments I've just shaken it off. . . I have been around many other Black people who have a serious love for the sport. . . But I hope to see more Black race car drivers, male and female.\"\n\nSwank watches it all play out, and is bothered by some of what he sees and experiences, but not deterred.\n\n\"I was always drawn to NASCAR,\" he said. \"Growing up, I didn't have a Bubba Wallace to look up to, anyone who looks like me. Lots of people like the idea of cars going fast, but the lack of diversity turns Black people away from the sport\n\n\"There's a long way to go. Unfortunately, dealing with some stuff is part of the job. I recognize I have to face obstacles a lot of other racers won't have to face. I won't let it discourage me.\"\n\nStill, the environment before he squeezes into his No. 4 car is not exactly welcoming. \"The idea of 'You don't belong there' creeps into your mind a little,\" he said. \"I feel added pressure to represent for Black people every time I go out.\"\n\nThe weight on his shoulders, he said, can be taxing. \"I'm a big proponent of helping people and understanding people. But I have had to compartmentalize things. I realize I'm not going to change anyone's minds out here.\"\n\nWallace's career changed when he became the driver of the NASCAR team purchased last year by Michael Jordan. The NBA legend and Charlotte Bobcat owner became the first Black principal owner of a racing team on the top level since Wendell Scott owned and drove his car almost 50 years ago.\n\nSwank's team and the backing of Overtime and Old Spice have bolstered his aspirations, even as he begins his third year of college. Swank started out racing in quarter midget cars and then moved into Bandolero and Legend cars when he was older. He now races in the Late Models division, with an eye on elevating to the ARCA series next. Right now, he if focusing on college until his next race near the end of the summer.\n\n\"I have a great team of people around me that supports me,\" he said. \"It was rough before Overtime and Old Spice came in. But that's the challenge in racing-funding. You have to have the right partners, some luck and a great group of people around you.\"\n\nThose people include his mother, Jennifer, who is Black and works in medical billing. She fears for her son's safety, but is encouraging. \"When they put you in the back, race your way to the front,\" she tells Hayden in the series.\n\nHis dad, Bob, is white and a high school football coach. He bought his son his first car and \"I've been driving ever since,\" Swank said.\n\nHarvey Holmes, a Black NASCAR fan, said, \"It would be great to see more Black drivers. There is money to be made and you don't have to be a certain type of athlete, just talented. We have to stop putting ourselves in a box, and learn new sports.

      "text": "Black gay community concerned monkeypox response is inadequate\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nIn July, a 35-year-old Black man from the Washington, D.C. area went from experiencing Covid-like symptoms to watching his body be overtaken by the aggravating, blistering boils of monkeypox. And yet, as he endured the agony and uncertainty that came with the disease, he said he had other, more pressing concerns.\n\nThe man, who asked to remain anonymous because of concerns related to the stigma associated with the disease, said he was alarmed by how difficult it was to find information on monkeypox and his doctor's seeming dismissal of his concerns about his symptoms.\n\nHe said his case is an example of the concerning public health response to monkeypox, and, for the Black population in particular, follows a historical pattern of medical malfeasance and shortcomings.\n\nThe man said when he visited urgent care in early July, the doctor didn't appear to take him seriously. \"I asked if she was up on the latest CDC guidelines on monkeypox and she wasn't,\" he recalled. \"So, she had to call the CDC to even get approval to administer me a test. She went on about how it would take an hour of paperwork and other stuff, so most doctors weren't excited about giving the tests.\"\n\nThe man, who is gay, said, \"it was like a repeat performance\" of some of the issues that came with the Covid pandemic, when Black people in many parts of the country had less access to treatment and vaccines, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\n\nNow with monkeypox, health care officials face the challenge of effectively communicating information about the spread of the outbreak without  stigmatizing gay men. Public health officials interviewed by NBC News said managing that balance is critical to gaining public confidence to offset the intense mistrust of the medical establishment in the Black community. The poor response by health officials, the disparities in the vaccine rollout and the stigma associated with monkeypox have contributed to men questioning how the virus is spread - despite the data, experts say.\n\nData from the CDC found that, through July 22, 99% of cases were among men, 94% of whom reported recent sexual contact with males. The World Health Organization added that 98.7% of confirmed cases globally are in males, with 97.2% of those men reporting that they had sex with other men.\n\nBlack men across the country have been hit especially hard by the outbreak. Although Blacks make up roughly 12% of the population, they make up 38% of the most recent monkeypox cases, according to the CDC . In Atlanta, 71% of people with the infection, which can cause painful and irritating skin lesions, are Black men who have sex with men and about two-thirds of those men have HIV, according to the Georgia Health Department .\n\nIn North Carolina, one of the few states reporting on the monkeypox spread, 70% of those infected are Black men, with nearly all of the cases affecting men who have sex with men. However, only 24% of the vaccines in the state have gone to Black North Carolinians.\n\nThose numbers worry Black gay men, as well as public health experts like Dr. Jayne Morgan, director of Piedmont HealthCare in Atlanta who hosts educational podcasts on monkeypox. She said the messaging has to be clear about who is at risk of contracting monkeypox and what preventive measures are available, all while being careful not to stigmatize specific groups of people.\n\n\"We have the tools and enough information to stem this tide,\" Dr. Morgan told NBC News. \"Public health, like Covid, is about behavior. Monkeypox is being driven by behavior. And so behavior can also drive it in the opposite direction also.\"\n\nHealth care experts believe that sex between men - both anal and oral intercourse - is likely the main driver of global monkeypox transmission . The skin contact that comes with sex, these experts say, is probably much less of a risk factor, citing studies published in peer-reviewed journals, as well as reports from national , regional and global health authorities , as previously reported by NBC News .\n\nThe statistics, misinformation and mistakes in the vaccine rollout have Black gay men worried they could be seeing a repeat of the response and stigma that came with the HIV/AIDS epidemic of the 1980s.\n\nThe 35-year-old D.C. resident, who no longer has monkeypox symptoms, called it \"dangerous.\"\n\nDavid J. Johns, the executive director of the National Black Justice Coalition, a civil rights organization committed to empowering the Black LGBTQ community and people living with HIV/AIDS, said the attention monkeypox is receiving now is happening only because non-Black people are also impacted.\n\n\"The sad reality is that monkeypox isn't new,\" Johns said, adding that it has existed in Africa since the 1970s . \"But because privileged white men from Western societies - in  particular America - are now being impacted by something that otherwise only impacted disposable Africans, there is a now shift in the way that people are thinking about and talking about and are responding to a virus that has been impacting people for a lot longer than we otherwise want to acknowledge.\"\n\nThe man from the D.C. area said that after a weekend of activities and attending \"a crowded party\" on July 10, he woke up the next day, \"not feeling my best.\" He was fatigued and had a fever of 102 and had trouble focusing. He left work early, believing he had contracted Covid.\n\nHe took a home test that came back negative. A test at urgent care confirmed he did not have the coronavirus. His fever eventually broke but he had a throbbing headache for days. And he said he experienced \"rectal discomfort\" and his blood pressure was elevated. Several days later, he began to feel better - but he noticed bumps on his face and arms.\n\nAfter some resistance, the doctor finally swabbed the blisters on his face and wrists and sent him home with 800 milligrams of ibuprofen and a prescription for his anal pain. At his residence, he said he isolated himself in the attic. In the morning, he woke up to extreme throat soreness. He returned to urgent care, where the doctor again had to call the CDC to see how to treat him since he had been tested positive for monkeypox.\n\nThe physician was advised by the CDC to administer an antibiotic shot, which alleviated some of the throat pain. Meanwhile, the sores spread to other parts of his body - arms, legs, in particular.\n\nBut \"it was kind of shocking,\" he said, that his issues were not immediately addressed. He added he was given eight different numbers to call for assistance. \"They dragged their feet the entire time.\"\n\nThe man said he gave a list of the friends he had been in close contact with to the health department for contact tracing. He had already advised them to seek medical attention by the time the health department contacted them two weeks later. \"And when they finally got someone, they were basically forced to say they had sex in order to get the vaccine,\" he added, noting that his friends felt pressured to say they had sexual contact with him - even when some didn't - in order to get immediate attention from health care professionals.\n\n\"When we talk about high-risk communities, we're really talking about people who are sort of disaffected from the health care system,\" Morgan said. \"Stigma and discrimination for people in the LBGTQ community are already very high. And then if you add the Black race on top of that, and you have in monkeypox the same as we did with Covid - the black population is always the most vulnerable because we have the least resources, the least outreach and the most discrimination and stigma.\"\n\nIn Los Angeles earlier in July, another Black man who also asked to remain anonymous because of the stigma associated with having the virus, outlined nearly identical concerns as the man in metro D.C. He, too, said he believed he didn't contract the disease through sex. When symptoms occurred, he said he had difficulty finding a place that tested for monkeypox. And when he did locate a health center in downtown Los Angeles, the staff was \"suited and booted as if I had a contagion,\" he said, referring to the protective gear they wore.\n\nMeanwhile, the disparity in those who have contracted monkeypox and those who have access to vaccines is glaring. While Black people account for about a third of monkeypox cases in the U.S., about 10% of vaccines have been administered to the group, according to the CDC .\n\nThe vaccine distribution disparities come as Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the head of the CDC , acknowledged that the agency must make drastic changes to respond better and faster to public health emergencies, following missteps during the Covid pandemic .\n\n\"We have learned less than nothing from Covid,\" Stella Safo, a primary care physician at Mount Sinai who specializes in HIV treatment and is the founder of Just Equity for Health, told STAT News . \"We've gone backwards.\"\n\nDr. Tyeese Gaines, a physician who practices emergency medicine in Illinois and New Jersey, said the more than two years of being on alert from the coronavirus pandemic has created \"panic fatigue,\" exasperating people to the point where they are less apt to protect themselves against monkeypox.\n\n\"We needed to tell people the reality of Covid-19,\" Gaines said. \"But eventually people just don't want to hear it anymore. Some people say: 'Oh, wow, there's another scary virus. Let me be safer.' But there's still a subset of people whose response to fear is not to become more conservative or to follow whatever the rules are, but actually to act like it doesn't exist and do the opposite.\"\n\nIt has not helped that there's been a history of public health issues in the Black community, with the demographic not always receiving equal or adequate health care. \"There're still a lot of areas that need to be improved if we're looking to provide equitable health care that is going to allow everyone a fair shot at being healthy,\" Gaines said. \"I don't think we fixed all those yet.\"\n\nCurtis Bunn is a reporter for NBC BLK.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Multiracial Americans surge in number, voice\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nIf you want a good glimpse of the multiracial experience in America, get inside Louie Gong's skin.\n\n\"I'm Nooksack, I'm Chinese, I'm French and I'm Scottish,\" Gong tells viewers of a multimedia piece he placed on YouTube to help spark discussion of multiracial issues. \"... When I was a kid, I drank my Ovaltine with real milk, and my cousins and I liked our fried rice with salmon.\"\n\nAt the same time that the nation's growing diversity and changing social attitudes are helping to swell the ranks of multiracial Americans at 10 times the rate of the white population, the presidential candidacy of Barack Obama, son of a black man and a white woman, has brought new attention, curiosity and discussion to their experiences.\n\nObama has faced an endless barrage of questions anchored to issues of race and class, from his ties to the Rev. Jeremiah Wright to whether, in his own words, he is \"too black\" or \"not black enough.\" As Gut Check America engaged msnbc.com readers in this re-emerging national conversation on race, it became clear that multiracial Americans offered unique perspectives on the topic and that the nation is far from entering a \"post-race\" era.\n\nGong, 33, is on the leading edge of what he calls the \"modern multiracial movement.\" A founder of the Mixed Heritage Center, a Web-based resource collection for multiracial Americans, Gong is also vice president and a key spokesman for the Mavin Foundation, a Seattle-based advocacy group for mixed-race people and families. As the educational resources director for the Muckleshoot Indian tribe's college near Seattle, he is able to tailor programs to Native Americans of mixed heritage. He teaches classes and workshops on the topic and is helping prepare a museum exhibit on the mixed-race experience set to open in Seattle in the fall.\n\nObama candidacy drives new interest As Gong's schedule attests, it's a busy, exciting time for folks who have worked for years to win understanding and acceptance of the unique path trod by multiracial Americans. \"Barack Obama has stepped into the picture now and is shining a floodlight on these issues,\" Gong told msnbc.com.\n\nWith interracial marriage illegal in 16 states until 1967 and racist sentiments against it remaining to this day in some places, the number of biracial and multiracial Americans is relatively small at less than 5 million. Although it includes a number of high-profile celebrities and athletes like Tiger Woods, Mariah Carey, Derek Jeter, Vin Diesel and Halle Berry, it's well under 2 percent of the nation's current 302 million residents.\n\n\"There's kind of a lot of hype that makes people think there's more, but there aren't,\" said demographer William H. Frey, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution.\n\nOfficially, the number was even a mystery until 2000, the first year the U.S. Census Bureau allowed Americans to say they were of mixed race.\n\nCensus counts vary Even now, there is confusion over various tallies offered by the federal agency. Some surveys, including the 2000 Census, allow respondents to choose \"some other race\" in addition to every possible combination of all recognized races. That inflated the count of multiracial Americans to 6.8 million.\n\nBut the agency's annual Population Estimate Program, considered its most current breakdown, does not include \"some other race\" and results in a count of Americans who claim to be of \"two or more races.\" Based on birth, death and tax records, the figure \"really is our official estimate of total population and population by race,\" said Census spokesman Robert Burnstein.\n\nThe most recent data, released May 1, shows the number of Americans of \"two or more races\" was 4,856,136 as of last July. The headline, though, is growth. Up from 4,711,932 the previous year, the tally indicates a 3 percent gain, which is 10 times the 0.3 percent growth of the white population in the same period and three times the overall U.S. population growth of about 1 percent. It's about the same as the growth rates of the Hispanic and Asian populations.\n\nAmerica's mixed-race population is up 25 percent since it was first calculated in 2000, while the nation's overall population has grown 7 percent in that time. Although still small in real numbers, the multiracial category is larger that the combined total of Native American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.\n\nOne thing in common: marginalization Such statistical exercises bring a warning from Gong.\n\n\"One of the most important things to understand is that the multiracial population is not a racial or ethnic group,\" he said. \"What we are really is a long thread that runs through the spectrum of race.\n\n\"The only thing that bonds us together as a group is the common ways that we're marginalized,\" said Gong, who himself \"had a very dynamic experience with race\" while growing up. Reared on tribal lands by his paternal Chinese grandfather and Nooksack grandmother, his home life was steeped in Native American culture and tradition. At school, \"I was poked and prodded\" into a more Asian identity because of his last name.\n\nAs mixed-race Americans, \"although we don't represent a consistent experience, the way society has tended to respond to us has been consistent,\" Gong said. \"Those are the issues that we rally around.\"\n\nDespite their growing numbers, multiracial Americans and their family members say society's response to them often remains a mixture of ignorance, judgment and downright rudeness.\n\nDr. Maria P.P. Root, a psychologist and researcher on multiracial families who has worked with the Mavin Foundation, has catalogued \"50 Experiences of Racially Mixed People\" as \"a launching point for sharing, discussing, laughing, debriefing, and educating.\" The list covers everything from the ubiquitous, insensitive \"what are you?\" question asked of multiracial people to them being told, \"You have the best of both worlds.\"\n\n\"Gut Check America\" readers shared hundreds of observations and anecdotes via e-mail and interviews with msnbc.com to illustrate their own experiences.\n\nConfusion over racial identity a common issue For many, the confusion of others over their racial identity is the biggest, and thorniest, issue.\n\nTake Sara Dale, a 33-year-old daughter of a black mom from Jamaica and a white dad from Pennsylvania. Caucasian in appearance, Dale said she has often been the recipient of racist comments about African-Americans from white co-workers and classmates. \"People just assume that I'm white when they see me, so they talk freely around me,\" said Dale, a resident of Boynton Beach, Fla. \"As soon as the conversation turns a certain way, I start getting really nervous. I'm not a confrontational person but I feel like I have to say something.\"\n\nOr Evelyn Marie Lewis-Keene, 42, a health-care worker from Huntington, W.Va., whose father is an African-American and whose Hispanic mother was born in Puerto Rico. \"When they ask what race I am, I don't check black or white,\" she said in an interview. \"I can't deny my mother and I can't deny my father.\" But others can and do, often elderly white residents at the care home where she works who plug her neatly into their racist stereotypes. \"When a patient gives me the N-word, you know what I say? I say, 'Wait a minute, if you're going to say it, get it right, because you can't deny my mom.'\" And she insists they add \"Rican\" to the slur.\n\nIt comes from all sides. Lewis-Keene says her mother was disowned for a time by her Puerto Rican parents because she married a black man. And Lewis-Keene believes some members of her father's family treat her mother disrespectfully because her English is hard for them to understand. \"You can't choose your family,\" she said with a sigh.\n\n'You have a choice to be white or not' Non-mixed members of multiracial families face their own special struggles. \"When you're in a biracial family, you have a choice to be white or not,\" said Mary Semela, a white mom of two biracial sons who is married to a black immigrant from South Africa. Semela, who lives in Ellicott City, Md., said some members of multiracial families can grow so weary of stares and questions when they are with their relatives of different colors that they'll intentionally go to public places alone at times. \"You have that choice just to walk away from your family,\" she said, adding that she would not do so herself.\n\nWhile her husband and sons have faced the all-too-familiar trappings of white racism against blacks, Semela, 51, said her sons also are seen by some African-Americans as less than full members of that community because, with their father a recent immigrant, \"they don't have slave heritage.\"\n\nDespite that, her older son, 20, a scholarship student at Colgate, \"feels very anchored as an African-American,\" which is in keeping with the view of Semela and many other American parents of biracial black and white children that \"as soon as your kids are old enough, they are black people in America, they are not half of anything.\"\n\nBut that view is changing, said anthropologist Marion Kilson, who wrote \"Claiming Place: Biracial Young Adults of the Post-Civil Rights Era.\" Kilson, who is white, is also the mother of two biracial daughters and a son. She has been married for nearly 50 years to Martin Kilson Jr., the first black professor to receive full tenure at Harvard.\n\nNew resources, support seen \"I think there's a generational difference,\" Kilson, 72, told msnbc.com. \"My perception, when my kids were little in the '60s, was that biracial Americans didn't have a choice about their racial identity, that the wider society would view them as being African-American.\" Because of that, \"I thought it was important to emphasize that they were African- American.\"\n\n\"Now, people have an opportunity to proclaim all of their racial identities,\" said Kilson, who is at work with colleague and friend Florence Ladd on a new book about rearing biracial children. \"One thing that's different for younger mothers today, there are many more support systems, quite a number of multiracial groups that exist, that involve parents and children, Web sites, clearly there are books that weren't available before. There's a lot more out there to support them today.\"\n\nIndeed, it's a veritable boom time right now, said Gong, who recently attended a Northern California gathering with leaders of 13 groups that work on mixed-race issues. \"There seems to be a sense that it's time for the modern multiracial movement to expand into new fronts,\" he said. \"College campuses in the past have represented the low-hanging fruit\" for those interested in organizing multiracial Americans. Various groups represented at the summit are looking to expand their efforts into other institutions and corporate venues. Gong is particularly interested in multiracial members of low-income communities.\n\nA tricky issue for organizers like Gong is apprehension among some leaders of minority communities that a new focus on multiracial identities could lessen their numbers.\n\n\"If we look at what was important for communities of color during the civil rights movement, it was solidarity,\" he said. \"Solidarity served African-Americans and Native Americans very well in the past so now we see a desire to maintain ethnic solidarity still playing out, especially among older folks. We're worried that we're going to dilute the voice we have if people identify as being black and white or Native American and black.\"\n\nSo while drawing attention to the needs of mixed-race Americans, \"We really need to respect those communities' needs to maintain ethnic solidarity,\" Gong said. \"Those needs are very real.\"\n\nFrey, the Brookings demographer and author of a February paper on \"Race, Immigration and America's Changing Electorate,\" said that while \"race does matter\" in U.S. elections, it's often hard to figure out just how. With the nation's single-race minority groups skewing Democrat but still vastly underrepresented on voter rolls relative to their overall numbers, he said, the impact of multiracial voters is especially hard to divine. \"They're really pretty small numbers,\" he said. \"We're going to have to look down the road quite a bit before they're going to become a major factor.\"\n\nInspiration drawn from Obama candidacy But Americans from multiracial backgrounds and families (some 5 million Americans are married across racial lines and millions more are members of racially blended families) seem universally happy and proud that a biracial man is the front-runner for a major party's presidential nomination. Over and over again, in e-mail and interviews, regardless of whether they agree with his politics or intend to vote for him, \"Gut Check\" respondents said they were heartened by Obama's candidacy.\n\n\"I like Obama,\" said Ken Woodard of Wichita. \"This is something that I've always dreamed of, someone who has the issues down pat, not just running as a black man, but running as a man who is sort of all of America, not just the black race but every race,\" said Woodard, 61, a black man who has a son and daughter with his white wife of 27 years.\n\nLewis-Keene, the West Virginia health-care worker, said she sees Obama as someone who is \"wholly true-hearted in his feelings of unity from the simple fact of where he comes from. ... I feel like he is the kind of person who would be able to solve conflicts with other countries just as well as here in the United States.\"\n\nDespite the positive feelings from the Obama candidacy and other strides, ambiguity and confusion over racial identity will persist for many mixed-race Americans, said Gong, a fact experienced even in families such as his own that have been multiracial for generations. The palette of cultural diversity has often been smudged by outside influences like \"all these federal policies that were designed to deconstruct native identity,\" such as off-reservation boarding schools, the Indian Removal Act and urban relocation programs.\n\nThe ambiguity caused by such policies made planning a recent funeral for one of his aunts a bit of a puzzle, Gong said. \"We did an eclectic ceremony, which is now becoming a family tradition, where everybody had a piece of the ceremony. It was in a Catholic church, based on the reservation, and we had a traditional Coast-Salish funeral song, and also a Shaker Church ceremony.\"\n\nThe lesson is clear, said Gong, whose own excitement and enthusiasm for America's changing colors is indomitable: America's melting pot isn't going to create a bland, homogenous porridge so much as a deeply flavored, spicy stew.\n\n\"Mixed race isn't post race. It's not less race. It's more race,\" Gong said. \"In order to dialog about mixed race, we need more understanding. It's not a dialog to forget about issues of race.\"\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Blacks struggle with 72 percent unwed mothers rate\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nOne recent day at Dr. Natalie Carroll's OB-GYN practice, located inside a low-income apartment complex tucked between a gas station and a freeway, 12 pregnant black women come for consultations. Some bring their children or their mothers. Only one brings a husband.\n\nThings move slowly here. Women sit shoulder-to-shoulder in the narrow waiting room, sometimes for more than an hour. Carroll does not rush her mothers in and out. She wants her babies born as healthy as possible, so Carroll spends time talking to the mothers about how they should care for themselves, what she expects them to do - and why they need to get married.\n\nSeventy-two percent of black babies are born to unmarried mothers today, according to government statistics. This number is inseparable from the work of Carroll, an obstetrician who has dedicated her 40-year career to helping black women.\n\n\"The girls don't think they have to get married. I tell them children deserve a mama and a daddy. They really do,\" Carroll says from behind the desk of her office, which has cushioned pink-and-green armchairs, bars on the windows, and a wooden \"LOVE\" carving between two African figurines. Diamonds circle Carroll's ring finger.\n\nAs the issue of black unwed parenthood inches into public discourse, Carroll is among the few speaking boldly about it. And as a black woman who has brought thousands of babies into the world, who has sacrificed income to serve Houston's poor, Carroll is among the few whom black women will actually listen to.\n\n\"A mama can't give it all. And neither can a daddy, not by themselves,\" Carroll says. \"Part of the reason is because you can only give that which you have. A mother cannot give all that a man can give. A truly involved father figure offers more fullness to a child's life.\"\n\nStatistics show just what that fullness means. Children of unmarried mothers of any race are more likely to perform poorly in school, go to prison, use drugs, be poor as adults, and have their own children out of wedlock.\n\nThe black community's 72 percent rate eclipses that of most other groups: 17 percent of Asians, 29 percent of whites, 53 percent of Hispanics and 66 percent of Native Americans were born to unwed mothers in 2008, the most recent year for which government figures are available. The rate for the overall U.S. population was 41 percent.\n\nThis issue entered the public consciousness in 1965, when a now famous government report by future senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan described a \"tangle of pathology\" among blacks that fed a 24 percent black \"illegitimacy\" rate. The white rate then was 4 percent.\n\nMany accused Moynihan, who was white, of \"blaming the victim:\" of saying that black behavior, not racism, was the main cause of black problems. That dynamic persists. Most talk about the 72 percent has come from conservative circles; when influential blacks like Bill Cosby have spoken out about it, they have been all but shouted down by liberals saying that a lack of equal education and opportunity are the true root of the problem.\n\n'Nobody talks about it' Even in black churches, \"nobody talks about it,\" Carroll says. \"It's like some big secret.\" But there are signs of change, of discussion and debate within and outside the black community on how to address the growing problem.\n\nResearch has increased into links between behavior and poverty, scholars say. Historically black Hampton University recently launched a National Center on African American Marriages and Parenting. There is a Marry Your Baby Daddy Day, founded by a black woman who was left at the altar, and a Black Marriage Day, which aims \"to make healthy marriages the norm rather than the exception.\"\n\nIn September, Princeton University and the liberal Brookings Institution released a collection of \"Fragile Families\" reports on unwed parents. And an online movement called \"No Wedding No Womb\" ignited a fierce debate that included strong opposition from many black women.\n\n\"There are a lot of sides to this,\" Carroll says. \"Part of our community has lost its way.\"\n\nThere are simple arguments for why so many black women have children without marriage.\n\nThe legacy of segregation, the logic goes, means blacks are more likely to attend inferior schools. This creates a high proportion of blacks unprepared to compete for jobs in today's economy, where middle-class industrial work for unskilled laborers has largely disappeared.\n\nThe drug epidemic sent disproportionate numbers of black men to prison, and crushed the job opportunities for those who served their time. Women don't want to marry men who can't provide for their families, and welfare laws created a financial incentive for poor mothers to stay single.\n\nIf you remove these inequalities, some say, the 72 percent will decrease.\n\n\"It's all connected. The question should be, how has the black family survived at all?\" says Maria Kefalas, co-author of \"Promises I Can Keep: Why Poor Women Put Motherhood Before Marriage.\"\n\nThe book is based on interviews with 162 low-income single mothers. One of its conclusions is that these women see motherhood as one of life's most fulfilling roles - a rare opportunity for love and joy, husband or no husband.\n\n'My children are what keep me going' Sitting in Carroll's waiting room, Sherhonda Mouton watches all the babies with the tender expression of a first-time mother, even though she's about to have her fourth child. Inside her purse is a datebook containing a handwritten ode to her children, titled \"One and Only.\" It concludes:\n\n\"You make the hardest tasks seem light with everything you do.\n\n\"How blessed I am, how thankful for my one and only you.\"\n\nMouton, 30, works full time as a fast-food manager on the 3 p.m. to 1 a.m. shift. She's starting classes to become a food inspector.\n\n\"My children are what keep me going, every day,\" she says. \"They give me a lot of hope and encouragement.\" Her plans for them? \"College, college, college.\"\n\nOn Mouton's right shoulder, the name of her oldest child, Zanevia, is tattooed around a series of scars. When Zanevia was an infant, Mouton's drug-addled fiance came home one night and started shooting. Mouton was hit with six bullets; Zanevia took three and survived.\n\n\"This man was the love of my life,\" Mouton says. He's serving a 60-year sentence. Another man fathered her second and third children; Mouton doesn't have good things to say about him. The father of her unborn child? \"He's around. He helps with all the kids.\"\n\nShe does not see marriage in her future.\n\n\"It's another obligation that I don't need,\" Mouton says. \"A good man is hard to find nowadays.\"\n\nMouton thinks it's a good idea to encourage black women to wait for marriage to have children. However, \"what's good for you might not be good for me.,\" Yes, some women might need the extra help of a husband. \"I might do a little better, but I'm doing fine now. I'm very happy because of my children.\"\n\n\"I woke up today at six o'clock,\" she says. \"My son was rubbing my stomach, and my daughter was on the other side. They're my angels.\"\n\n'I want better for us' Christelyn Karazin has four angels of her own. She had the first with her boyfriend while she was in college; they never married. Her last three came after she married another man and became a writer and homemaker in an affluent Southern California suburb.\n\nIn September, Karazin, who is black, marshaled 100 other writers and activists for the online movement No Wedding No Womb, which she calls \"a very simplified reduction of a very complicated issue.\"\n\n\"I just want better for us,\" Karazin says. \"I have four kids to raise in this world. It's about what kind of world do we want.\"\n\n\"We've spent the last 40 years discussing the issues of how we got here. How much more discussion, how many more children have to be sacrificed while we still discuss?\"\n\nThe reaction was swift and ferocious. She had many supporters, but hundreds of others attacked NWNW online as shallow, anti-feminist, lacking solutions, or a conservative tool. Something else about Karazin touched a nerve: She's married to a white man and has a book about mixed-race relationships coming out.\n\nBlogger Tracy Clayton, who posted a vicious parody of NWNW's theme song, said the movement focuses on the symptom instead of the cause.\n\n\"It's trying to kill a tree by pulling leaves off the limbs. And it carries a message of shame,\" said Clayton, a black woman born to a single mother. \"I came out fine. My brother is married with children. (NWNW) makes it seem like there's something immoral about you, like you're contributing to the ultimate downfall of the black race. My mom worked hard to raise me, so I do take it personally.\"\n\nDemetria Lucas, relationships editor at Essence, the magazine for black women, declined an invitation for her award-winning personal blog to endorse NWNW. Lucas, author of the forthcoming book \"A Belle in Brooklyn: Advice for Living Your Single Life & Enjoying Mr. Right Now,\" says plenty of black women want to be married but have a hard time finding suitable black husbands.\n\n70 percent of professsional black women are unmarried Lucas says 42 percent of all black women and 70 percent of professional black women are unmarried. \"If you can't get a husband, who am I to tell you no, you can't be a mom?\" she asks. \"A lot of women resent the idea that you're telling me my chances of being married are like 1 in 2, it's a crapshoot right now, but whether I can have a family of my own is based on whether a guy asks me to marry him or not.\"\n\nMuch has been made of the lack of marriageable black men, Lucas says, which has created the message that \"there's no real chance of me being married, but because some black men can't get their stuff together I got to let my whole world fall apart. That's what the logic is for some women.\"\n\nThat logic rings false to Amy Wax, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, whose book \"Race, Wrongs and Remedies: Group Justice in the 21st Century\" argues that even though discrimination caused blacks' present problems, only black action can cure them.\n\n\"The black community has fallen into this horribly dysfunctional equilibrium\" with unwed mothers, Wax says in an interview. \"It just doesn't work.\"\n\n\"Blacks as a group will never be equal while they have this situation going on, where the vast majority of children do not have fathers in the home married to their mother, involved in their lives, investing in them, investing in the next generation.\"\n\n\"The 21st century for the black community is about building human capital,\" says Wax, who is white. \"That is the undone business. That is the unmet need. That is the completion of the civil rights mission.\"\n\n'You owe them something better than you got' All the patients are gone now from Carroll's office - the prison guard, the young married couple, the 24-year-old with a 10-year-old daughter and the father of her unborn child in jail. The final patient, an 18-year-old who dropped out of college to have her first child, departs by taxi, alone.\n\n\"I can't tell you that I feel deep sadness, because I don't,\" says Carroll, who has two grown children of her own. \"And not because I'm not fully aware of what's happening to them. It's because I do all that I can to help them help themselves.\"\n\nCarroll is on her second generation of patients now, delivering the babies of her babies. She does not intend to stop anytime soon. Her father, a general practitioner in Houston, worked right up until he died.\n\nEach time she brings a child into this world, she thinks about what kind of life it will have.\n\n\"I tell the mothers, if you decide to have a baby, you decide to have a different kind of life because you owe them something. You owe them something better than you got.\"\n\n\"I ask them, what are you doing for your children? Do you want them to have a better life than you have? And if so, what are you going to do about it?\"\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Multiracial Americans surge in number, voice\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nIf you want a good glimpse of the multiracial experience in America, get inside Louie Gong's skin.\n\n\"I'm Nooksack, I'm Chinese, I'm French and I'm Scottish,\" Gong tells viewers of a multimedia piece he placed on YouTube to help spark discussion of multiracial issues. \"... When I was a kid, I drank my Ovaltine with real milk, and my cousins and I liked our fried rice with salmon.\"\n\nAt the same time that the nation's growing diversity and changing social attitudes are helping to swell the ranks of multiracial Americans at 10 times the rate of the white population, the presidential candidacy of Barack Obama, son of a black man and a white woman, has brought new attention, curiosity and discussion to their experiences.\n\nObama has faced an endless barrage of questions anchored to issues of race and class, from his ties to the Rev. Jeremiah Wright to whether, in his own words, he is \"too black\" or \"not black enough.\" As Gut Check America engaged msnbc.com readers in this re-emerging national conversation on race, it became clear that multiracial Americans offered unique perspectives on the topic and that the nation is far from entering a \"post-race\" era.\n\nGong, 33, is on the leading edge of what he calls the \"modern multiracial movement.\" A founder of the Mixed Heritage Center, a Web-based resource collection for multiracial Americans, Gong is also vice president and a key spokesman for the Mavin Foundation, a Seattle-based advocacy group for mixed-race people and families. As the educational resources director for the Muckleshoot Indian tribe's college near Seattle, he is able to tailor programs to Native Americans of mixed heritage. He teaches classes and workshops on the topic and is helping prepare a museum exhibit on the mixed-race experience set to open in Seattle in the fall.\n\nObama candidacy drives new interest As Gong's schedule attests, it's a busy, exciting time for folks who have worked for years to win understanding and acceptance of the unique path trod by multiracial Americans. \"Barack Obama has stepped into the picture now and is shining a floodlight on these issues,\" Gong told msnbc.com.\n\nWith interracial marriage illegal in 16 states until 1967 and racist sentiments against it remaining to this day in some places, the number of biracial and multiracial Americans is relatively small at less than 5 million. Although it includes a number of high-profile celebrities and athletes like Tiger Woods, Mariah Carey, Derek Jeter, Vin Diesel and Halle Berry, it's well under 2 percent of the nation's current 302 million residents.\n\n\"There's kind of a lot of hype that makes people think there's more, but there aren't,\" said demographer William H. Frey, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution.\n\nOfficially, the number was even a mystery until 2000, the first year the U.S. Census Bureau allowed Americans to say they were of mixed race.\n\nCensus counts vary Even now, there is confusion over various tallies offered by the federal agency. Some surveys, including the 2000 Census, allow respondents to choose \"some other race\" in addition to every possible combination of all recognized races. That inflated the count of multiracial Americans to 6.8 million.\n\nBut the agency's annual Population Estimate Program, considered its most current breakdown, does not include \"some other race\" and results in a count of Americans who claim to be of \"two or more races.\" Based on birth, death and tax records, the figure \"really is our official estimate of total population and population by race,\" said Census spokesman Robert Burnstein.\n\nThe most recent data, released May 1, shows the number of Americans of \"two or more races\" was 4,856,136 as of last July. The headline, though, is growth. Up from 4,711,932 the previous year, the tally indicates a 3 percent gain, which is 10 times the 0.3 percent growth of the white population in the same period and three times the overall U.S. population growth of about 1 percent. It's about the same as the growth rates of the Hispanic and Asian populations.\n\nAmerica's mixed-race population is up 25 percent since it was first calculated in 2000, while the nation's overall population has grown 7 percent in that time. Although still small in real numbers, the multiracial category is larger that the combined total of Native American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.\n\nOne thing in common: marginalization Such statistical exercises bring a warning from Gong.\n\n\"One of the most important things to understand is that the multiracial population is not a racial or ethnic group,\" he said. \"What we are really is a long thread that runs through the spectrum of race.\n\n\"The only thing that bonds us together as a group is the common ways that we're marginalized,\" said Gong, who himself \"had a very dynamic experience with race\" while growing up. Reared on tribal lands by his paternal Chinese grandfather and Nooksack grandmother, his home life was steeped in Native American culture and tradition. At school, \"I was poked and prodded\" into a more Asian identity because of his last name.\n\nAs mixed-race Americans, \"although we don't represent a consistent experience, the way society has tended to respond to us has been consistent,\" Gong said. \"Those are the issues that we rally around.\"\n\nDespite their growing numbers, multiracial Americans and their family members say society's response to them often remains a mixture of ignorance, judgment and downright rudeness.\n\nDr. Maria P.P. Root, a psychologist and researcher on multiracial families who has worked with the Mavin Foundation, has catalogued \"50 Experiences of Racially Mixed People\" as \"a launching point for sharing, discussing, laughing, debriefing, and educating.\" The list covers everything from the ubiquitous, insensitive \"what are you?\" question asked of multiracial people to them being told, \"You have the best of both worlds.\"\n\n\"Gut Check America\" readers shared hundreds of observations and anecdotes via e-mail and interviews with msnbc.com to illustrate their own experiences.\n\nConfusion over racial identity a common issue For many, the confusion of others over their racial identity is the biggest, and thorniest, issue.\n\nTake Sara Dale, a 33-year-old daughter of a black mom from Jamaica and a white dad from Pennsylvania. Caucasian in appearance, Dale said she has often been the recipient of racist comments about African-Americans from white co-workers and classmates. \"People just assume that I'm white when they see me, so they talk freely around me,\" said Dale, a resident of Boynton Beach, Fla. \"As soon as the conversation turns a certain way, I start getting really nervous. I'm not a confrontational person but I feel like I have to say something.\"\n\nOr Evelyn Marie Lewis-Keene, 42, a health-care worker from Huntington, W.Va., whose father is an African-American and whose Hispanic mother was born in Puerto Rico. \"When they ask what race I am, I don't check black or white,\" she said in an interview. \"I can't deny my mother and I can't deny my father.\" But others can and do, often elderly white residents at the care home where she works who plug her neatly into their racist stereotypes. \"When a patient gives me the N-word, you know what I say? I say, 'Wait a minute, if you're going to say it, get it right, because you can't deny my mom.'\" And she insists they add \"Rican\" to the slur.\n\nIt comes from all sides. Lewis-Keene says her mother was disowned for a time by her Puerto Rican parents because she married a black man. And Lewis-Keene believes some members of her father's family treat her mother disrespectfully because her English is hard for them to understand. \"You can't choose your family,\" she said with a sigh.\n\n'You have a choice to be white or not' Non-mixed members of multiracial families face their own special struggles. \"When you're in a biracial family, you have a choice to be white or not,\" said Mary Semela, a white mom of two biracial sons who is married to a black immigrant from South Africa. Semela, who lives in Ellicott City, Md., said some members of multiracial families can grow so weary of stares and questions when they are with their relatives of different colors that they'll intentionally go to public places alone at times. \"You have that choice just to walk away from your family,\" she said, adding that she would not do so herself.\n\nWhile her husband and sons have faced the all-too-familiar trappings of white racism against blacks, Semela, 51, said her sons also are seen by some African-Americans as less than full members of that community because, with their father a recent immigrant, \"they don't have slave heritage.\"\n\nDespite that, her older son, 20, a scholarship student at Colgate, \"feels very anchored as an African-American,\" which is in keeping with the view of Semela and many other American parents of biracial black and white children that \"as soon as your kids are old enough, they are black people in America, they are not half of anything.\"\n\nBut that view is changing, said anthropologist Marion Kilson, who wrote \"Claiming Place: Biracial Young Adults of the Post-Civil Rights Era.\" Kilson, who is white, is also the mother of two biracial daughters and a son. She has been married for nearly 50 years to Martin Kilson Jr., the first black professor to receive full tenure at Harvard.\n\nNew resources, support seen \"I think there's a generational difference,\" Kilson, 72, told msnbc.com. \"My perception, when my kids were little in the '60s, was that biracial Americans didn't have a choice about their racial identity, that the wider society would view them as being African-American.\" Because of that, \"I thought it was important to emphasize that they were African- American.\"\n\n\"Now, people have an opportunity to proclaim all of their racial identities,\" said Kilson, who is at work with colleague and friend Florence Ladd on a new book about rearing biracial children. \"One thing that's different for younger mothers today, there are many more support systems, quite a number of multiracial groups that exist, that involve parents and children, Web sites, clearly there are books that weren't available before. There's a lot more out there to support them today.\"\n\nIndeed, it's a veritable boom time right now, said Gong, who recently attended a Northern California gathering with leaders of 13 groups that work on mixed-race issues. \"There seems to be a sense that it's time for the modern multiracial movement to expand into new fronts,\" he said. \"College campuses in the past have represented the low-hanging fruit\" for those interested in organizing multiracial Americans. Various groups represented at the summit are looking to expand their efforts into other institutions and corporate venues. Gong is particularly interested in multiracial members of low-income communities.\n\nA tricky issue for organizers like Gong is apprehension among some leaders of minority communities that a new focus on multiracial identities could lessen their numbers.\n\n\"If we look at what was important for communities of color during the civil rights movement, it was solidarity,\" he said. \"Solidarity served African-Americans and Native Americans very well in the past so now we see a desire to maintain ethnic solidarity still playing out, especially among older folks. We're worried that we're going to dilute the voice we have if people identify as being black and white or Native American and black.\"\n\nSo while drawing attention to the needs of mixed-race Americans, \"We really need to respect those communities' needs to maintain ethnic solidarity,\" Gong said. \"Those needs are very real.\"\n\nFrey, the Brookings demographer and author of a February paper on \"Race, Immigration and America's Changing Electorate,\" said that while \"race does matter\" in U.S. elections, it's often hard to figure out just how. With the nation's single-race minority groups skewing Democrat but still vastly underrepresented on voter rolls relative to their overall numbers, he said, the impact of multiracial voters is especially hard to divine. \"They're really pretty small numbers,\" he said. \"We're going to have to look down the road quite a bit before they're going to become a major factor.\"\n\nInspiration drawn from Obama candidacy But Americans from multiracial backgrounds and families (some 5 million Americans are married across racial lines and millions more are members of racially blended families) seem universally happy and proud that a biracial man is the front-runner for a major party's presidential nomination. Over and over again, in e-mail and interviews, regardless of whether they agree with his politics or intend to vote for him, \"Gut Check\" respondents said they were heartened by Obama's candidacy.\n\n\"I like Obama,\" said Ken Woodard of Wichita. \"This is something that I've always dreamed of, someone who has the issues down pat, not just running as a black man, but running as a man who is sort of all of America, not just the black race but every race,\" said Woodard, 61, a black man who has a son and daughter with his white wife of 27 years.\n\nLewis-Keene, the West Virginia health-care worker, said she sees Obama as someone who is \"wholly true-hearted in his feelings of unity from the simple fact of where he comes from. ... I feel like he is the kind of person who would be able to solve conflicts with other countries just as well as here in the United States.\"\n\nDespite the positive feelings from the Obama candidacy and other strides, ambiguity and confusion over racial identity will persist for many mixed-race Americans, said Gong, a fact experienced even in families such as his own that have been multiracial for generations. The palette of cultural diversity has often been smudged by outside influences like \"all these federal policies that were designed to deconstruct native identity,\" such as off-reservation boarding schools, the Indian Removal Act and urban relocation programs.\n\nThe ambiguity caused by such policies made planning a recent funeral for one of his aunts a bit of a puzzle, Gong said. \"We did an eclectic ceremony, which is now becoming a family tradition, where everybody had a piece of the ceremony. It was in a Catholic church, based on the reservation, and we had a traditional Coast-Salish funeral song, and also a Shaker Church ceremony.\"\n\nThe lesson is clear, said Gong, whose own excitement and enthusiasm for America's changing colors is indomitable: America's melting pot isn't going to create a bland, homogenous porridge so much as a deeply flavored, spicy stew.\n\n\"Mixed race isn't post race. It's not less race. It's more race,\" Gong said. \"In order to dialog about mixed race, we need more understanding. It's not a dialog to forget about issues of race.\"\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Hayden Swank, called a race car driving wunderkind, navigates college and racism\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nA year ago, Hayden Swank sold his beloved car so he could drive faster cars.\n\nThe 19-year-old was running out of money to support his fledgling career in race car driving that he hopes will one day land him a spot in NASCAR. So he did the unfathomable for a teenager and unloaded his 2004 Mercury Grand Marquis.\n\nFrom the Atlanta-area town of Woodstock, Swank has been considered by many a wunderkind of race car driving. So far, he has racked up more than 20 wins since he first eased behind a steering wheel of a quarter midget car when he was 7 years old.\n\nFulfilling his promise, though, was precarious until he and his team gained sponsorships from Overtime, the sports brand and basketball league, and the men's grooming brand Old Spice.\n\nThe relief Swank felt was palpable, played out during an enlightening eight-part Overtime series called Race that chronicles his challenges and triumphs, from financial concerns to car malfunctions, to dealing with volatile fans and opposition, to his parents' support, to balancing college and racing.\n\n\"This sport has a history that is not diverse,\" said Swank, who is studying business at the University of Georgia. \"The sport has a lot of work to do. I have accepted that. My job is not to win people over, just to win races.\"\n\nNot that anything has come easy. The teenager said he has heard his fair share of ugly remarks from drivers and teams, as well as fans. In the Overtime series, a crew member urged him not to reveal his face - and racial identity - before a race: \"Don't not take off your helmet, no matter what.\"\n\nPoised and thoughtful, Swank said participating in a sport that has historically had very few Black drivers at the highest level of the profession - Bubba Wallace follows Wendell Scott, who broke NASCAR's race barrier in the 1960s - tests his patience, but grows his resolve.\n\n\"I cope,\" he said. \"When I show up, I'm not only the only mixed or Black person racing, but I'm the only minority in the whole place of maybe 2,000 people. So, sure, I feel like an outsider, like I don't belong. There's added pressure.\n\n\"Some people claim I'm there because I'm a token, that we paid our way. That's not close to true. For the most part, I think they respect me. But there are a few drivers I won't be friends with. And there are certain tracks that are not fans of mine. But I accept it.\"\n\nIn 2004, NASCAR instituted the NASCAR Diversity Pit Crew Internship Program, which has produced at least 55 Black graduates working in NASCAR, including Brehanna Daniels. The former basketball player at the historically Black Norfolk State University made history in 2018 as the first Black woman to work on a pit crew in NASCAR's top series.\n\nDaniels excelled and  in 2019 she became the first African American woman to serve on a pit crew at the Daytona 500.\n\nRaynard Revels II, also a Norfolk State graduate, took advantage of the Drive for Diversity Program in 2019 and has used the last two years to work as a pit crew member for hire as he seeks to elevate onto a premier team. The former linebacker for the football team who lives in Charlotte had never been to a NASCAR race before entering the program.\n\nBlack men who worked or work in pit crews - Dion \"Rocko\" Williams, Phil Horton, Ernest Holden and Lamar Neal - serve as either mentors or a support system for Revels.\n\n\"It's a predominantly white sport, but I look at it as being on a team,\" Revels, 27, said. \"And when you're on a team, you do all you can to win.\"\n\nOther HBCUs like Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte are encouraging students to pursue a career in the sport. And while the efforts have worked out for Davis and others, there are still only three nonwhite drivers: Wallace, who is Black, Kyle Larson, who is Japanese American, and Daniel Suárez, who is Mexican.\n\nLast summer, the world Swank wants to compete in came into full light during the Black Lives Matter demonstrations. Wallace had publicly supported BLM and called for the removal of Confederate flags at races. Soon after, a noose was found hanging in his garage at Talladega Raceway in Alabama - a clear threat that harkens to the days when Black people were openly lynched.\n\nAn FBI investigation found that the rope may have looked like a noose, it was actually a garage pull rope. By then, the drivers had lined up behind Wallace on pit road as a show of solidarity.\n\nMahogany Boss, a Black woman who said she loves NASCAR and used to race cars in low-level competition, said she \"definitely experienced racism at the track. There have been moments when I lashed back out, and moments I've just shaken it off. . . I have been around many other Black people who have a serious love for the sport. . . But I hope to see more Black race car drivers, male and female.\"\n\nSwank watches it all play out, and is bothered by some of what he sees and experiences, but not deterred.\n\n\"I was always drawn to NASCAR,\" he said. \"Growing up, I didn't have a Bubba Wallace to look up to, anyone who looks like me. Lots of people like the idea of cars going fast, but the lack of diversity turns Black people away from the sport\n\n\"There's a long way to go. Unfortunately, dealing with some stuff is part of the job. I recognize I have to face obstacles a lot of other racers won't have to face. I won't let it discourage me.\"\n\nStill, the environment before he squeezes into his No. 4 car is not exactly welcoming. \"The idea of 'You don't belong there' creeps into your mind a little,\" he said. \"I feel added pressure to represent for Black people every time I go out.\"\n\nThe weight on his shoulders, he said, can be taxing. \"I'm a big proponent of helping people and understanding people. But I have had to compartmentalize things. I realize I'm not going to change anyone's minds out here.\"\n\nWallace's career changed when he became the driver of the NASCAR team purchased last year by Michael Jordan. The NBA legend and Charlotte Bobcat owner became the first Black principal owner of a racing team on the top level since Wendell Scott owned and drove his car almost 50 years ago.\n\nSwank's team and the backing of Overtime and Old Spice have bolstered his aspirations, even as he begins his third year of college. Swank started out racing in quarter midget cars and then moved into Bandolero and Legend cars when he was older. He now races in the Late Models division, with an eye on elevating to the ARCA series next. Right now, he if focusing on college until his next race near the end of the summer.\n\n\"I have a great team of people around me that supports me,\" he said. \"It was rough before Overtime and Old Spice came in. But that's the challenge in racing-funding. You have to have the right partners, some luck and a great group of people around you.\"\n\nThose people include his mother, Jennifer, who is Black and works in medical billing. She fears for her son's safety, but is encouraging. \"When they put you in the back, race your way to the front,\" she tells Hayden in the series.\n\nHis dad, Bob, is white and a high school football coach. He bought his son his first car and \"I've been driving ever since,\" Swank said.\n\nHarvey Holmes, a Black NASCAR fan, said, \"It would be great to see more Black drivers. There is money to be made and you don't have to be a certain type of athlete, just talented. We have to stop putting ourselves in a box, and learn new sports. Jim Brown played Lacrosse.\"\n\nSwank is definitely playing outside the box. The question is: Will he eventually compete inside it?\n\n\"I feel like an outsider sometimes, like I don't belong,\" he said. \"But I'm going to keep going. The path is clear . . . hopefully.\"\n\nFollow NBCBLK on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .\n\nCurtis Bunn is a reporter for NBC BLK.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Black gay community concerned monkeypox response is inadequate\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nIn July, a 35-year-old Black man from the Washington, D.C. area went from experiencing Covid-like symptoms to watching his body be overtaken by the aggravating, blistering boils of monkeypox. And yet, as he endured the agony and uncertainty that came with the disease, he said he had other, more pressing concerns.\n\nThe man, who asked to remain anonymous because of concerns related to the stigma associated with the disease, said he was alarmed by how difficult it was to find information on monkeypox and his doctor's seeming dismissal of his concerns about his symptoms.\n\nHe said his case is an example of the concerning public health response to monkeypox, and, for the Black population in particular, follows a historical pattern of medical malfeasance and shortcomings.\n\nThe man said when he visited urgent care in early July, the doctor didn't appear to take him seriously. \"I asked if she was up on the latest CDC guidelines on monkeypox and she wasn't,\" he recalled. \"So, she had to call the CDC to even get approval to administer me a test. She went on about how it would take an hour of paperwork and other stuff, so most doctors weren't excited about giving the tests.\"\n\nThe man, who is gay, said, \"it was like a repeat performance\" of some of the issues that came with the Covid pandemic, when Black people in many parts of the country had less access to treatment and vaccines, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\n\nNow with monkeypox, health care officials face the challenge of effectively communicating information about the spread of the outbreak without  stigmatizing gay men. Public health officials interviewed by NBC News said managing that balance is critical to gaining public confidence to offset the intense mistrust of the medical establishment in the Black community. The poor response by health officials, the disparities in the vaccine rollout and the stigma associated with monkeypox have contributed to men questioning how the virus is spread - despite the data, experts say.\n\nData from the CDC found that, through July 22, 99% of cases were among men, 94% of whom reported recent sexual contact with males. The World Health Organization added that 98.7% of confirmed cases globally are in males, with 97.2% of those men reporting that they had sex with other men.\n\nBlack men across the country have been hit especially hard by the outbreak. Although Blacks make up roughly 12% of the population, they make up 38% of the most recent monkeypox cases, according to the CDC . In Atlanta, 71% of people with the infection, which can cause painful and irritating skin lesions, are Black men who have sex with men and about two-thirds of those men have HIV, according to the Georgia Health Department .\n\nIn North Carolina, one of the few states reporting on the monkeypox spread, 70% of those infected are Black men, with nearly all of the cases affecting men who have sex with men. However, only 24% of the vaccines in the state have gone to Black North Carolinians.\n\nThose numbers worry Black gay men, as well as public health experts like Dr. Jayne Morgan, director of Piedmont HealthCare in Atlanta who hosts educational podcasts on monkeypox. She said the messaging has to be clear about who is at risk of contracting monkeypox and what preventive measures are available, all while being careful not to stigmatize specific groups of people.\n\n\"We have the tools and enough information to stem this tide,\" Dr. Morgan told NBC News. \"Public health, like Covid, is about behavior. Monkeypox is being driven by behavior. And so behavior can also drive it in the opposite direction also.\"\n\nHealth care experts believe that sex between men - both anal and oral intercourse - is likely the main driver of global monkeypox transmission . The skin contact that comes with sex, these experts say, is probably much less of a risk factor, citing studies published in peer-reviewed journals, as well as reports from national , regional and global health authorities , as previously reported by NBC News .\n\nThe statistics, misinformation and mistakes in the vaccine rollout have Black gay men worried they could be seeing a repeat of the response and stigma that came with the HIV/AIDS epidemic of the 1980s.\n\nThe 35-year-old D.C. resident, who no longer has monkeypox symptoms, called it \"dangerous.\"\n\nDavid J. Johns, the executive director of the National Black Justice Coalition, a civil rights organization committed to empowering the Black LGBTQ community and people living with HIV/AIDS, said the attention monkeypox is receiving now is happening only because non-Black people are also impacted.\n\n\"The sad reality is that monkeypox isn't new,\" Johns said, adding that it has existed in Africa since the 1970s . \"But because privileged white men from Western societies - in  particular America - are now being impacted by something that otherwise only impacted disposable Africans, there is a now shift in the way that people are thinking about and talking about and are responding to a virus that has been impacting people for a lot longer than we otherwise want to acknowledge.\"\n\nThe man from the D.C. area said that after a weekend of activities and attending \"a crowded party\" on July 10, he woke up the next day, \"not feeling my best.\" He was fatigued and had a fever of 102 and had trouble focusing. He left work early, believing he had contracted Covid.\n\nHe took a home test that came back negative. A test at urgent care confirmed he did not have the coronavirus. His fever eventually broke but he had a throbbing headache for days. And he said he experienced \"rectal discomfort\" and his blood pressure was elevated. Several days later, he began to feel better - but he noticed bumps on his face and arms.\n\nAfter some resistance, the doctor finally swabbed the blisters on his face and wrists and sent him home with 800 milligrams of ibuprofen and a prescription for his anal pain. At his residence, he said he isolated himself in the attic. In the morning, he woke up to extreme throat soreness. He returned to urgent care, where the doctor again had to call the CDC to see how to treat him since he had been tested positive for monkeypox.\n\nThe physician was advised by the CDC to administer an antibiotic shot, which alleviated some of the throat pain. Meanwhile, the sores spread to other parts of his body - arms, legs, in particular.\n\nBut \"it was kind of shocking,\" he said, that his issues were not immediately addressed. He added he was given eight different numbers to call for assistance. \"They dragged their feet the entire time.\"\n\nThe man said he gave a list of the friends he had been in close contact with to the health department for contact tracing. He had already advised them to seek medical attention by the time the health department contacted them two weeks later. \"And when they finally got someone, they were basically forced to say they had sex in order to get the vaccine,\" he added, noting that his friends felt pressured to say they had sexual contact with him - even when some didn't - in order to get immediate attention from health care professionals.\n\n\"When we talk about high-risk communities, we're really talking about people who are sort of disaffected from the health care system,\" Morgan said. \"Stigma and discrimination for people in the LBGTQ community are already very high. And then if you add the Black race on top of that, and you have in monkeypox the same as we did with Covid - the black population is always the most vulnerable because we have the least resources, the least outreach and the most discrimination and stigma.\"\n\nIn Los Angeles earlier in July, another Black man who also asked to remain anonymous because of the stigma associated with having the virus, outlined nearly identical concerns as the man in metro D.C. He, too, said he believed he didn't contract the disease through sex. When symptoms occurred, he said he had difficulty finding a place that tested for monkeypox. And when he did locate a health center in downtown Los Angeles, the staff was \"suited and booted as if I had a contagion,\" he said, referring to the protective gear they wore.\n\nMeanwhile, the disparity in those who have contracted monkeypox and those who have access to vaccines is glaring. While Black people account for about a third of monkeypox cases in the U.S., about 10% of vaccines have been administered to the group, according to the CDC .\n\nThe vaccine distribution disparities come as Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the head of the CDC , acknowledged that the agency must make drastic changes to respond better and faster to public health emergencies, following missteps during the Covid pandemic .\n\n\"We have learned less than nothing from Covid,\" Stella Safo, a primary care physician at Mount Sinai who specializes in HIV treatment and is the founder of Just Equity for Health, told STAT News . \"We've gone backwards.\"\n\nDr. Tyeese Gaines, a physician who practices emergency medicine in Illinois and New Jersey, said the more than two years of being on alert from the coronavirus pandemic has created \"panic fatigue,\" exasperating people to the point where they are less apt to protect themselves against monkeypox.\n\n\"We needed to tell people the reality of Covid-19,\" Gaines said. \"But eventually people just don't want to hear it anymore. Some people say: 'Oh, wow, there's another scary virus. Let me be safer.' But there's still a subset of people whose response to fear is not to become more conservative or to follow whatever the rules are, but actually to act like it doesn't exist and do the opposite.\"\n\nIt has not helped that there's been a history of public health issues in the Black community, with the demographic not always receiving equal or adequate health care. \"There're still a lot of areas that need to be improved if we're looking to provide equitable health care that is going to allow everyone a fair shot at being healthy,\" Gaines said. \"I don't think we fixed all those yet.\"\n\nCurtis Bunn is a reporter for NBC BLK.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"
