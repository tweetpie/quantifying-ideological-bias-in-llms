(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Ivanka Trump didn't want to testify. But on the stand Wednesday in her father's civil fraud trial , she took the opportunity to contend the family business has \"overdelivered,\" even as she kept her distance from financial documents that New York state says were fraudulent.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's elder daughter capped a major stretch in the lawsuit that could reshape his real estate empire. She followed her father and her brothers Eric and Donald Trump Jr. to the witness stand, and the New York attorney general's office rested its case after her testimony. The defense gets its turn now.\n\nIvanka Trump has been in her father's inner circle in both business and politics, as an executive vice president at the family's Trump Organization and then as a senior White House adviser. But she testified that she had no role in his personal financial statements, which New York Attorney General Letitia James claims were fraudulently inflated and deceived banks and lenders.\n\n\"Those were not things that I was privy to,\" beyond having seen \"a few documents and correspondence\" that referred to them, Ivanka Trump said.\n\nThe ex-president and Republican 2024 front-runner denies any wrongdoing. He insisted in court Monday that his financial statements actually greatly underestimated his net worth, that any discrepancies were minor, that a disclaimer absolved him of liability anyway and that \"this case is a disgrace.\"\n\nIn even-tempered testimony that provided a counterpoint to her father's caustic turn on the stand , Ivanka Trump touched on some of the same notes that the ex-president has hammered inside court and out - portraying the Trump Organization as a successful developer of big-dollar projects that satisfied its lenders.\n\nThe Doral golf resort in Florida? A \"Herculean\" renovation undertaken to refurbish a faded treasure that Donald Trump had visited in childhood, his daughter testified.\n\nThe company's historic Old Post Office building-turned-hotel in Washington? \"A labor of love\" to turn a dilapidated building into a super-luxury hotel, while navigating approvals from a raft of different government agencies.\n\n\"They were complicated projects, and I believe we overdelivered on every metric,\" she said.\n\nBut when questions about the post office project turned to questions that its government owners raised about some aspects of her father's financial statements, she said she didn't recall that.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump walks out of the courtroom after testifying at New York Supreme Court, Monday, Nov. 6, 2023, in New York. (AP Photo/Eduardo Munoz Alvarez)\n\nThe agency overseeing the bidding flagged those concerns in a December 2011 letter to her, and Trump Organization executives looped her in as they prepared a response ahead of a presentation to officials in Washington. An agency document showed the company addressed the issues in its presentation, which she attended.\n\nBut Ivanka Trump said she didn't recall \"that they discussed financial statements specifically.\" Rather, she remembered talk of \"our vision for the project\" and the company's experience, with her father mentioning his renovation of New York's famous Plaza Hotel.\n\nShe retained a stake in the Washington hotel lease until its 2022 sale, which netted her $4 million.\n\nUnlike her father and his adult sons, Ivanka Trump is no longer a defendant in the case, and her lawyers had tried to prevent her from having to testify.\n\nOrdered to do so, she said she largely didn't recall the documents and details she was asked about. During about four hours of polite answers punctuated by broad smiles, she once thanked a lawyer in Attorney General James' office for bringing up the Old Post Office proposal because it \"brought back a lot of memories.\"\n\n\"Ivanka Trump was cordial, she was disciplined, she was controlled, and she was very courteous,\" James, a Democrat, said outside court. But, she added: \"This case is about fraudulent statements of financial condition that she benefited from. She was enriched. And clearly, you cannot distance yourself from that fact.\"\n\nJames' legal team and Trump defense lawyers repeatedly tangled Wednesday over the scope of Ivanka Trump's questioning, including whether she could be asked about 2013 emails that included her husband, Jared Kushner, in discussions about potential Trump company loans.\n\nKushner - a real estate executive himself - didn't work for the Trump Organization. But he had introduced his wife to a Deutsche Bank banker as the Trumps were seeking financing to buy and overhaul Doral, Ivanka Trump testified. Because he also worked in real estate, they would sometimes exchange ideas and advice, she said.\n\nShe became the point person in establishing a lending relationship with Deutsche Bank's private wealth management arm. It eventually extended the Trump Organization hundreds of millions of dollars in loans, with terms that required Donald Trump to submit his financial statements each year.\n\nAmid such assets as Trump Tower, the Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and Doral, the financial statements included a Trump-owned building on New York's Park Avenue. Ivanka Trump leased and had options to buy two apartments there, and the state's lawyers contend that her father offered her a steep discount while claiming on his financial statements that the apartments were worth far more.\n\nShe testified that she invested over $7.5 million in one of the apartments, a penthouse, but never made it her permanent home because she and her family moved to Washington.\n\nShe stepped away from her Trump Organization job as her father's 2017 inauguration neared, and she became an unpaid senior adviser . After the Trump administration ended, she and her family moved to Florida.\n\nThe non-jury trial will decide allegations of conspiracy, insurance fraud and falsifying business records - but Judge Arthur Engoron already has resolved the lawsuit's top claim by ruling that Trump engaged in fraud . That decision came with provisions that could strip the ex-president of oversight of such marquee properties as Trump Tower, though an appeals court is allowing him continued control of his holdings for now.\n\nJames, a Democrat, is seeking over $300 million in penalties and a ban on Trump doing business in New York.\n\nWith the case now turning to the defense, the Trumps' attorneys plan to argue Thursday that the judge should find in their favor immediately.\n\n\"The attorney general rested their case, and it is very clear that they have failed to prove the essential elements of the case,\" Trump attorney Alina Habba said outside court.\n\nEric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., who are still Trump Organization EVPs, also have professed minimal knowledge of their father's annual financial statements. Donald Trump Jr. testified that he dealt with the documents only in passing; Eric Trump said he relied completely on accountants and lawyers to ensure the documents' accuracy.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - A New York appeals court dismissed Ivanka Trump on Tuesday from a wide-ranging fraud lawsuit brought against her father and his company last year by the state's attorney general.\n\nThe civil lawsuit, brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James, accused former President Donald Trump of padding his net worth by billions of dollars and misleading banks, insurance companies and others about the value of his assets, including golf courses and the Mar-a-Lago estate. It named his three eldest children -- Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric Trump -- as defendants, along with multiple Trump Organization executives.\n\nIn a ruling on Tuesday, the Appellate Division of New York's Supreme Court dismissed the claims against Ivanka Trump, ruling that they were barred by the state's statute of limitations. While claims over alleged wrongdoing after February 2016 were permissible, the court said, Ivanka Trump had stepped back from involvement in the Trump Organization and wasn't accused in the lawsuit of any misconduct during that later time period.\n\nThe panel left it to a lower-court judge to determine whether other parts of the lawsuit would also be barred by the state's statute of limitations.\n\nA representative for Ivanka Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment. James' office said in a statement that it planned to continue to pursue the case.\n\nThe lawsuit is the result of a three-year investigation into Trump and his business by James, a Democrat.\n\nIt details dozens of instances of alleged fraud, many involving claims made on annual financial statements that Trump would give to banks, business associates and financial magazines as proof of his riches as he sought loans and deals.\n\nTrump has dismissed the investigation as a \"politically motivated Witch Hunt.\"\n\nAn attorney for Trump, Christopher Kise, said on Tuesday that the ruling \"represented the first step towards ending a case that should never have been filed.\"\n\n\"Going forward, we remain confident that once all the real facts are known, there will be no doubt President Trump has built an extraordinarily successful business empire and has simply done nothing other than generate tremendous profits for those financial institutions involved in the transactions at issue in the litigation,\" he said.\n\nJames has said her investigation uncovered evidence of potential criminal violations by Trump, including insurance fraud and bank fraud, that would be referred to outside authorities.\n\nShe also said Ivanka Trump, who worked as executive vice president at the Trump Organization, personally participated in the effort to exaggerate her father's wealth and obtain favorable loan terms from banks and real-estate licensing deals.\n\nAttorneys for Ivanka Trump disputed that, arguing that the lawsuit does not contain any evidence that she \"directly or indirectly created, prepared, reviewed, or certified any of her father's financial statements.\"\n\nThe Attorney's General Office is seeking a financial penalty of $250 million, as well as a ban on Trump and his family from doing business in New York. The case is set to go to trial in October.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Ivanka Trump, former President Donald Trump's daughter and one of those closest to him during the insurrection at the Capitol, is testifying before the House panel investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack.\n\nMississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson, the committee's chairman, said Tuesday afternoon that she had been answering investigators' questions on a video teleconference since the morning and was not \"chatty\" but had been helpful to the probe.\n\n\"She came in on her own\" and did not have to be subpoenaed, Thompson said.\n\nIvanka Trump, who was with her father in the White House that day, is one of more than 800 witnesses the committee has interviewed as it works to compile a record of the attack, the worst on the Capitol in more than two centuries. She the first of Trump's children known to speak to the committee and one of the closest people to her father.\n\nWhether she gives the committee new information or not, her decision to cooperate is significant for the panel, which has been trying to secure an interview with her since late January. The nine-member panel is particularly focused on what the former president was doing as his supporters broke into the Capitol and interrupted the certification of President Joe Biden's victory.\n\nIvanka Trump's testimony comes less than a week after her husband, Jared Kushner, testified to the committee in a separate virtual meeting that lasted more than six hours. Members of the panel said his testimony was helpful and were hoping to further fill in the gaps with her help.\n\nThe panel is using the interviews to compile a comprehensive record and will begin to release information in the coming months as it holds public hearings and releases a series of reports on the insurrection. While Congress doesn't have power to charge anyone with a crime, members of the panel say the objective is to create the most comprehensive record possible so nothing like it ever happens again.\n\nLawmakers have said they want to discuss what Ivanka Trump knew about her father's efforts, including a telephone call they say she witnessed , to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence to reject Biden's 2020 election win as part of his ceremonial role overseeing the electoral count. Pence rejected those efforts.\n\nThe committee is also interested in any concerns she may have heard from Pence's staff, members of Congress and the White House counsel's office about Trump's pressure on Pence.\n\nIvanka Trump's cooperation stands in contrast with some of her father's other top advisers, several of whom have refused to cooperate as the former president has fought the probe. Trump has tried to exert executive privilege over documents and interviews, but in many cases has been overruled by courts or Biden, who has that authority as the sitting president.\n\nThe House is expected to vote this week to recommend contempt charges for Trump advisers Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino, both of whom the committee says have been uncooperative. The committee previously voted to recommend contempt charges against longtime Trump ally Steve Bannon, who defied a congressional subpoena, and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, who ceased cooperating with the panel.\n\nBannon was later indicted by a federal grand jury and is awaiting prosecution by the Justice Department. The Justice Department has not taken any action against Meadows.\n\nOther witnesses who are still close to the former president - and several who were in the White House that day - have declined to answer the committee's questions.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Donald Trump is set to testify Nov. 6 at his New York civil fraud trial, following his three eldest children to the witness stand in a case that threatens to disrupt their family's real estate empire, state lawyers said Friday.\n\nIt was already expected that the former president and sons Donald Jr. and Eric would testify. The timing became clear Friday, after Judge Arthur Engoron ruled that daughter Ivanka Trump also must appear, rejecting her bid to avoid testifying.\n\nThe schedule sets up a blockbuster stretch in the trial of New York Attorney General Letitia James' lawsuit. She alleges that the former president, now the Republican front-runner for 2024, overstated his wealth for years on financial statements that were given to banks, insurers and others to help secure loans and deals.\n\nTrump denies any wrongdoing and has called the trial a politically motivated sham. The case could strip Trump of some of his corporate holdings and marquee properties such as Trump Tower. James and Engoron are Democrats.\n\nDonald Trump and the two sons are defendants in the lawsuit, but the state is initially calling them to the stand before the defense begins its case. The defense can then call them again.\n\nIn a surprise preview, Donald Trump ended up briefly testifying Wednesday to answer Engoron's questions about whether an out-of-court comment was aimed at his law clerk. The judge had earlier barred participants in the trial from talking publicly about court staffers.\n\nTrump said his remark wasn't about the clerk; Engoron called that testimony \"not credible\" and fined Trump $10,000, on top of a $5,000 fine imposed days earlier over an online post about the clerk. Trump's lawyers paid both fines on his behalf but still might appeal them, according to a court filing Friday.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. is now set to testify next Wednesday, brother Eric on Thursday and sister Ivanka on Nov. 3, though her lawyers may appeal to try to block her testimony.\n\nAn appeals court dismissed her as a defendant in the lawsuit in June, saying the claims against her were too old. Ivanka Trump announced in January 2017, ahead of her father's inauguration, that she was stepping away from her job as an executive vice president at the family company, the Trump Organization. She soon became an unpaid senior adviser in the Trump White House. After her father's term ended, she moved to Florida.\n\nHer lawyer, Bennet Moskowitz, told the judge Friday that state lawyers \"just don't have jurisdiction over her.\" One of Donald Trump's attorneys, Christopher Kise, maintained that state lawyers \"just want another free-for-all on another of President Trump's children.\"\n\n\"The idea that somehow Ms. Trump is under the control of the Trump Organization or any of the defendants, her father -- anyone who has raised a daughter past the age of 13 knows that they're not under their control,\" Kise said.\n\nHowever, the state's lawyers argued that Ivanka Trump was a key participant in some events discussed in the case and remains financially and professionally intertwined with the family business and its leaders.\n\nEngoron sided with the state, citing documents showing that Ivanka Trump continued to have ties to some businesses in New York and still owns Manhattan apartments.\n\n\"Ms. Trump has clearly availed herself of the privilege of doing business in New York,\" Engoron said.\n\nDuring her years at the Trump Organization, Ivanka Trump was involved in negotiating and securing financing for various properties, including a lease and loan for a Washington hotel and loans for Trump's Doral golf resort near Miami and a Trump-owned hotel and condo skyscraper in Chicago, according to court filings.\n\nAccording to the New York attorney general's office, Ivanka Trump retained a financial interest in the Trump Organization's operations even after leaving for the White House, including through an interest in the now-sold Washington hotel.\n\nIn court papers that included emails and other documents, the state lawyers said the Trump Organization and its staff also have bought insurance for Ivanka Trump and her businesses, managed her household staff and credit card bills, rented her apartment and paid her legal fees.\n\nIn 2021 federal disclosures, she reported $2.6 million in income from Trump entities, including revenue from a vehicle known as TTT Consulting LLC. A company bookkeeper testified that TTT was set up for her and her brothers to reap a share of fees from some licensing agreements.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Michael R.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - The House committee investigating the U.S. Capitol insurrection is asking Ivanka Trump, daughter of former President Donald Trump, to voluntarily cooperate as lawmakers make their first public attempt to arrange an interview with a Trump family member.\n\nThe committee sent a letter Thursday requesting a meeting in February with Ivanka Trump, a White House adviser to her father. In the letter, the committee chairman, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said Ivanka Trump was in direct contact with her father during key moments on Jan. 6, 2021, when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in an effort to halt the congressional certification of Joe Biden's presidential win.\n\nThe riot followed a rally near the White House where Donald Trump had urged his supporters to \"fight like hell\" as Congress convened to certify the 2020 election results.\n\nThe committee says it wants to discuss what Ivanka Trump knew about her father's efforts, including a telephone call they say she witnessed, to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence to reject those results, as well as concerns she may have heard from Pence's staff, members of Congress and the White House counsel's office about those efforts.\n\n\"Ivanka Trump just learned that the January 6 Committee issued a public letter asking her to appear,\" her spokesperson said. \"As the Committee already knows, Ivanka did not speak at the January 6 rally.\"\n\nThe committee cited testimony that Ivanka Trump implored her father to quell the violence by his supporters and investigators want to ask about her actions while the insurrection was underway.\n\n\"Testimony obtained by the Committee indicates that members of the White House staff requested your assistance on multiple occasions to intervene in an attempt to persuade President Trump to address the ongoing lawlessness and violence on Capitol Hill,\" Thompson wrote.\n\nThe letter is the committee's first attempt to seek information from inside the Trump family. Earlier this week, it issued subpoenas to lawyer Rudy Giuliani and other members of Trump's legal team who filed meritless court challenges to the election that fueled the lie that the race had been stolen from Trump.\n\nThe committee is narrowing in on three requests to Ivanka Trump, starting with a conversation alleged to have taken place between Donald Trump and Pence on the morning of the attack. The committee said Keith Kellogg, who was Pence's national security adviser, was also in the room and testified to investigators that Trump questioned whether Pence had the courage to delay the congressional counting of the electoral votes.\n\nThe Constitution makes clear that a vice president's role is largely ceremonial in the certification process, and Pence had issued a statement before the congressional session that laid out his conclusion that a vice president could not claim \"unilateral authority\" to reject states' electoral votes.\n\n\"You were present in the Oval Office and observed at least one side of that telephone conversation,\" the letter to Ivanka Trump said, adding that the committee \"wishes to discuss the part of the conversation you observed\" between the then-president and Pence.\n\nThe letter also mentioned a message, in the days before the scheduled vote certification on Jan. 6, 2021, between an unidentified member of the House Freedom Caucus to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows with an explicit warning: \"If POTUS allows this to occur ... we're driving a stake in the heart of the federal republic.\" POTUS is an abbreviation for president of the United States.\n\nThe other requests in the letter to Ivanka Trump concern conversations after Donald Trump's tweeted, \"Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution.\" The committee said White House staff and even members of Congress requested Ivanka Trump's help in trying to convince her father that he should address the violence and tell rioters to go home.\n\n\"We are particularly interested in this question: Why didn't White House staff simply ask the President to walk to the briefing room and appear on live television - to ask the crowd to leave the capital?\"\n\nBesides the subpoenas issued this week, the committee had a victory Wednesday when the Supreme Court rejected a bid by Trump to block the release of White House records sought by lawmakers.\n\nThe National Archives began to turn over the hundreds of pages of records to the nine-member committee almost immediately. They include presidential diaries, visitor logs, speech drafts and handwritten notes dealing with Jan. 6 from the Meadows' files.\n\nThe committee's investigation has touched nearly every corner of Trump's orbit in the nearly seven months since it was created, from strategist Steve Bannon to media companies such as Twitter, Meta and Reddit.\n\nThe committee says it has interviewed nearly 400 people and issued dozens of subpoenas as it prepares a report set for release before the November elections. Still, the committee has run into roadblocks from some of Trump's allies, including Bannon and Meadows, who have refused to fully cooperate. Their resistance has led the committee to file charges of contempt of Congress.\n\nThe seven Democrats and two Republicans on the committee have also faced defiance from fellow lawmakers. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and GOP Reps. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Jim Jordan of Ohio have denied the committee's requests for voluntary cooperation.\n\nWhile the committee has considered subpoenaing fellow lawmakers, that would be an extraordinary move and could run up against legal and political challenges.\n\nThe committee says the extraordinary trove of material it has collected - 35,000 pages of records so far, including texts, emails and phone records from people close to Trump - is fleshing out critical details of the worst attack on the Capitol in two centuries.\n\nThe next phase of the investigation will include a series of public hearings in the coming months.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Darlene Superville contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump was in the Oval Office with his daughter Ivanka and Vice President Mike Pence's national security adviser on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, when he made yet another push to pressure Pence.\n\nTrump again told Pence that he had a duty to reject Electoral College votes that would formalize Democrat Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election, something the vice president had no authority to do in his ceremonial role in Congress that day.\n\n\"You don't have the courage to make a hard decision,\" Trump told Pence, according to congressional testimony. Even after Trump called him a \"wimp,\" Pence rebuffed the demand, issuing a lengthy statement afterward laying out his conclusion that he had no power to influence the outcome.\n\nWhen the call ended, Ivanka Trump turned to retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg and said, \"Mike Pence is a good man.\"\n\n\"Yes, he is,\" Kellogg replied.\n\nNow the House committee investigating the riot wants to know what else Ivanka Trump heard and saw that day as they try to stitch together the narrative of the riots and the former president's role in instigating them. There was a frantic effort by many of Trump's top supporters to persuade him to intervene, and some directly sought to use his daughter as their conduit.\n\nA committee aide said they are hopeful that she will soon commit to a time to meet.\n\nThroughout her time in the White House, Ivanka Trump was known as a rare voice who could get through to her father and talk him out of bad decisions, though her success was mixed. The former first daughter has kept an extraordinary low profile since her father left office and has distanced herself from him and politics since moving to Florida.\n\nBut her proximity to him on Jan. 6 could provide the committee with direct access to what Trump was doing during those crucial three hours when his supporters violently stormed Capitol.\n\n\"Ivanka Trump has details about what occurred in the lead-up to and on Jan. 6 and about the former president's state of mind as events unfolded,\" Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla, a member of the panel, told The Associated Press.\n\nIt is highly unusual for congressional investigators to target a family member of a president, but as a senior adviser to her father, she also had a perch close to power.\n\nKellogg disclosed the exchange with the committee, but so far Ivanka Trump, who famously guards her image and public profile, has not talked to the panel.\n\nThe answers could have significant repercussions not only for Donald Trump, who is eyeing a political comeback in 2024, but for those in the Republican Party who have downplayed his role in the insurrection.\n\nA spokeswoman for Ivanka Trump did not respond to multiple requests for comment. But in a statement issued in late January, a representative for her noted that Ivanka Trump did not speak at the rally near the White House where the then-president urged his supporters to \"fight like hell\" as Congress convened to certify the 2020 election results, and said she still believed that \"any security breach or disrespect to our law enforcement is unacceptable.\"\n\nMembers of the committee hope to get beyond such vague assertions.\n\nHours after Trump's call to Pence, Ivanka Trump joined brother Donald Trump Jr., Rudy Giuliani and Kimberly Guilfoyle under a large tent at the rally to listen to Trump's speech.\n\nShe reportedly told aides she \"decided to attend only because she had hoped to calm the president and help keep the event on an even keel.\"\n\nAfter Trump's speech, as rioters began to smash through Capitol police barriers and break windows, the former president tweeted: \"Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution ...\"\n\nThat tweet, according to court testimony, only added to the anger fueling the mob.\n\nBack in the White House, as staffers watched in shock at what was unfolding down Pennsylvania Avenue on television screens positioned throughout the West Wing, Trump's attention was so rapt that he hit rewind and watched certain moments again, according to Stephanie Grisham, a former White House press secretary.\n\n\"Look at all of the people fighting for me,\" Trump said, according to Grisham, who also served as chief of staff to first lady Melania Trump. At one point, the president was confused why staffers weren't as excited as he was watching the unrest unfold.\n\nKellogg testified that staff wanted the president to take immediate action to address the violence consuming the Capitol, but Trump refused.\n\n\"Is someone getting to potus? He has to tell protestors to dissipate. Someone is going to get killed,\" Alyssa Farah Griffin, a former White House communications official, texted Ben Williamson, an aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.\n\n\"I've been trying for the last 30 minutes. Literally stormed in outer oval to get him to put out the first one. It's completely insane,\" Williamson wrote back.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., then called Ivanka Trump, pleading that the president \"ask people to leave.\"\n\n\"We're working on it,\" she replied.\n\nAt that point, staffers acknowledged that despite efforts by Meadows, press secretary Kayleigh McEnany and Kellogg, the only person who could get through to him would be his daughter.\n\nIvanka Trump, according to testimony, went on to make at least two \"tenacious\" attempts to reason with her father as staffers were bombarded with messages from Trump allies begging him to quell the violence.\n\n\"Can he make a statement. I saw the tweet. Ask people to leave the (Capitol),\" Fox News host Sean Hannity texted Meadows.\n\nBut inside the West Wing, Kellogg strongly recommended that they not ask the president to appear in the press room, where a group of reporters would be waiting for him.\n\n\"Apparently, certain White House staff believed that a live unscripted press appearance by the President in the midst of the Capitol Hill violence could have made the situation worse,\" lawmakers wrote in their letter to Ivanka Trump.\n\nThe president ultimately agreed to a video statement. Multiple takes were filmed but not used. In each one of the initial takes, according to the committee, he failed to ask rioters to leave.\n\nThe final video was released on Twitter at 4:17 p.m. - nearly two hours after Trump's initial tweet criticizing Pence.\n\n\"This was a fraudulent election, but we can't play into the hands of these people,\" Trump said in the video. \"We have to have peace. So go home. We love you; you're very special.\"\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., the vice chair of the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection, has said it's hard to \"imagine a more significant and more serious dereliction of duty\" than Trump's failure to quell the riots.\n\nTrump's last words that day came at 6:01 p.m. when he tweeted that the 2020 election was \"unceremoniously and viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly and unfairly treated for so long.\"\n\nHe ended with, \"Go home with love and in peace. Remember this day forever.\"\n\nThe committee has been aggressively interviewing witnesses - nearly 500 so far - and has subpoenaed Meadows and Trump's personal lawyer. They are asking Ivanka Trump to cooperate voluntarily.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jill Colvin in New York and Mary Clare Jalonick in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the spelling of the former White House communications official's name is Farah, not Farrah.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Trump is in Morocco promoting a global economic program for women. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nRABAT, Morocco (AP) - Ivanka Trump brushed off criticism that her family has profited off the presidency and said Friday a big difference between her family and Democrat Joe Biden's is that President Donald Trump amassed his fortune before he entered politics while Biden's wealth is \"derivative\" of his time in office.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, she said the two situations were \"completely inverse.\"\n\nIn New Hampshire, Biden responded that the president's daughter should look at his tax returns for evidence he didn't cash in as vice president or a legislator.\n\nIvanka Trump, a White House adviser, pushed back against nearly three years of ethics complaints and lawsuits accusing the Trumps of trying to turn the presidency to their financial advantage. The president and his allies have tried to tarnish Biden by making similar but unfounded claims about Biden's tenure as vice president and his son Hunter's activities in Ukraine during that time.\n\nBiden's son, Hunter, served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company as his father led the Obama administration's diplomatic dealings with Kyiv. Although anti-corruption advocates expressed concern about the timing, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by the former vice president or his son.\n\nBiden spent more than 30 years representing Delaware in the U.S. Senate before serving eight years as vice president and Ivanka Trump said he \"created wealth as a derivative of that.\"\n\nHer father entered politics after making a fortune in real estate.\n\n\"His wealth, and our wealth, collectively and independently, was created prior to government service and prior to anyone in our lives having run for elected office,\" Ivanka Trump said.\n\n\"Most people do create their wealth post service. We created ours prior,\" she added.\n\nMembers of Congress must follow strict rules while in office to avoid financial and other conflicts of interest. Many pursue higher-paying opportunities after they leave office.\n\nBiden was consistently among the poorest members of Congress, relying largely on his lawmaker's salary, according to his annual financial disclosure forms.\n\nBut he has seen his income grow since leaving the White House in 2017. A financial disclosure form Biden released this year shows he and his wife, Jill, took in more than $15 million since leaving the Obama White House, including a lucrative book deal.\n\n\"Tell her to look at my tax returns,\" Biden responded from New Hampshire, where he filed paperwork to appear on the ballot next year. \"I've laid it all out - everything,\" he added before calling on Trump to release his own income tax returns.\n\nGovernment watchdogs have criticized Trump for unethically mixing official business with promotion of his own interests.\n\nTrump is the first president in modern history who has not walled himself off from his business holdings. He makes frequent trips to his for-profit golf clubs, collects dues at his members-only properties and hosts fundraisers and foreign delegations at hotels that bear his family's name.\n\nIvanka Trump spoke in a wide-ranging AP interview as she wrapped up a three-day visit to Morocco, where she promoted U.S. efforts to help empower women in developing countries.\n\nSpeaking about the House impeachment inquiry from half a world away, she echoed her father's view that the investigation is aimed at overturning the 2016 election that put him in the White House.\n\nBut she parted ways with him by saying the identity of the whistleblower whose complaint helped spark the investigation is \"not particularly relevant.\"\n\nPresident Trump and some of his allies lately have been pressing mainstream journalists to publicize the whistleblower's name. The president has also sent tweets calling on the individual to come forward.\n\nBut Ivanka Trump said the person's motives were more important than knowing their identity. She declined to speculate about what led the individual to lodge a formal complaint.\n\n\"The whistleblower shouldn't be a substantive part of the conversation,\" she told AP, saying the person \"did not have firsthand information.\"\n\nShe said the individual's identity is not \"particularly relevant\" to her, \"aside from what the motivation behind all of this was.\"\n\nShe noted that the whistleblower was not among administration officials who heard the president ask Ukraine's leader during a July 25 telephone conversation to investigate Biden, a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination to challenge Trump.\n\nIvanka Trump said her family has faced constant criticism since her father became president and that impeachment is part of that pattern. House Democrats counter that the inquiry is about whether Trump abused his office by putting his political interests first.\n\n\"Rather than wait, under a year, until the people can decide for themselves based on his record and based on his accomplishments, this new effort has, has commenced,\" she said. \"But to us, it's really been like this from the beginning.\"\n\nShe said she has not been reading transcripts of the depositions that current and former administration officials have given impeachment investigators.\n\nAs for the future, Ivanka Trump said she had yet to decide on what role she will play in her father's re-election campaign.\n\nAnd on the question of whether she also wants four more years at the White House, the mother of three said the answer would largely depend on the needs of her children.\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press writer Holly Ramer in Concord, New Hampshire, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Ivanka Trump unveils White House global women initiative\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Ivanka Trump is unveiling an effort aimed at helping 50 million women in the developing world get ahead economically over the next six years.\n\nOn Thursday, the White House will officially launch the Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative, a governmentwide project led by the senior adviser and daughter to President Donald Trump. The initiative will involve the State Department, the National Security Council and other agencies. It aims to coordinate current programs and develop new ones to assist women in areas such as job training, financial support, and legal or regulatory reforms.\n\nThe president previewed the launch during his State of the Union address Tuesday night, describing it as \"part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere.\" He will sign a national security memorandum to officially launch the initiative Thursday, framing it as a way to promote stability around the world.\n\nIvanka Trump, who will attend the Munich Security Conference next week to promote the project, stressed that she sees this as a national security priority. \"We think women are arguably the most under-tapped resource in the developing world for accelerating economic growth and prosperity,\" she told The Associated Press.\n\nThe effort will draw on public and private resources, with the U.S. Agency for International Development initially setting up a $50 million fund, using already-budgeted dollars. As part of the launch, USAID and Pepsi Co. will announce a partnership aimed at women in India, and USAID and UPS will sign an agreement designed to help female entrepreneurs export goods.\n\nTrump has twice tried unsuccessfully to slash USAID's budget by a third, and his \"America first\" foreign policy has sought to limit the United States' role as an international leader. But his daughter said this effort was in keeping with administration goals, arguing it was a strategic investment that promoted security.\n\n\"We're proud of our legacy of being a generous nation, looking to uplift others around the world. But we want to do so in a fiscally responsible way,\" she said, promising \"rigorous\" efforts to track progress. Among those she has consulted for the project is former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.\n\nThe White House launch Thursday will feature a roundtable discussion and presidential signing ceremony. Attendees were to include Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, national security adviser John Bolton, officials from USAID and UNICEF, elected officials and business leaders, as well as women who are the beneficiaries of this type of aid.\n\nThe initiative builds on previous White House efforts to help women internationally. The Obama administration established an Office of Global Women's Issues at the State Department and established an ambassador-at-large for global women's Issues. That position has been vacant since Trump took office - drawing criticism from some advocates - but the White House said it now has a candidate lined up for the job.\n\nSince she joined the administration in early 2017, Ivanka Trump has focused on women's economic issues. She previously led an effort to launch a World Bank fund to help drive women's entrepreneurship. And she recently advocated for the Women's Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act, which bolsters efforts focused on women by USAID.\n\nIvanka Trump said her hope is that this effort has staying power beyond the current administration. Past global initiatives she has studied include the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, started under President George W. Bush in 2003.\n\n\"This is not an initiative that we think should stop at the culmination of the administration,\" she said. \"We think it's something that should sustain itself over time, and we're going to work really hard to show that this is a great use of foreign development assistance.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

She is slated to attend the Republican National Convention next week in Milwaukee, where she'll be appearing in a personal capacity to support her father, according to The Daily Mail .\n\nKushner and Trump and their family attend a baseball game in New York in late 2023.\n\nHer apparent decision to attend as a private citizen instead of as a delegate or fundraiser is in contrast to her role at the convention in 2020, where she acted as a headliner and introduced her father to the stage.\n\nAnd while she hasn't yet taken a prominent role in her father's campaign, she appeared on the right-leaning \"Lex Fridman Podcast\" last week, her first major interview this election cycle, in which she offered her first comments on her father's hush-money trial in Manhattan.\n\nThe case was very \"painful\" to see play out, she said, adding that she still fully backs her father.\n\nIvanka Trump attends an NBA Playoff game in Miami last April.\n\nShe also said she had been more willing to take an active role during Trump's first term because he was a political newbie who needed a circle of trusted advisers by his side.\n\n\"My father had never spent the night in Washington, D.C. before staying in the White House,\" she said. \"There wasn't a part of me that could imagine a 70 or 80-year-old version of myself that would have been OK with saying no.\"\n\nIvanka, who often treats her 7.5 million Instagram followers to snaps from her various vacations, told Fridman that politics is a \"pretty dark world\" that's \"at odds\" with the life she wants for herself and her family, but only time will tell if she sticks to sunbathing over political strategy.\n\nBreaking News Intern\n\njosephine.walker@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

She may be my daughter but nobody could have competed with her, with her rat-tat-tat, the whole deal she's got.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, Trump said Ivanka wanted to focus on \"helping people get jobs.\" He added, \"She would go around, not a glamorous job, to see Walmart, to see Exxon, all these big companies to hire people.\" And Ivanka \"hired millions of people\" during her time in his administration, said Trump.\n\nIvanka and her husband Jared Kushner 's obscure senior roles in Trump's administration had previously raised ethics concerns . Together they reportedly made $82 million while serving as Trump's advisers.\n\nThe Moms for Liberty crowd was mostly mum on the Ivanka claim, so Justice steered the conversation into more familiar talking points, with Trump proceeding to bash Vice President Kamala Harris , Democrats, and ABC network, which will host their debate on Sep. 10 .\n\n\"She didn't want to debate,\" Trump claimed of Harris, describing her as a \"Marxist\" and \"defective person.\" He added, \"They were not happy about it but they got the network that they wanted.\"\n\nTrump then slammed gender-affirming surgery. \"Think of it, your kid goes to school and comes home a few days later with an operation,\" he said, before veering off into rants about his former reality TV show The Apprentice , President Joe Biden , former President Barack Obama , and his own Scottish heritage.\n\n\"Do you know that some of the biggest, smartest, most brilliant leaders come from Scotland?\" he told the audience. \"Or at least, you know, their parents came from Scotland. Scotland did very well in this country.\"\n\nTrump then recounted how his parents fell in love and got married.\n\n\"They were married for six and half decades. A long time,\" Trump said. \"I said, 'Pop, I'm not going to be able to beat you.'\"\n\nNow on his third marriage, Trump was right.\n\nNews Reporter\n\nemell.adolphus@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner refused to sign memo saying Trump was not antisemitic, book says\n\nPair declined to give public endorsement of Trump in wake of 7 October attacks, All or Nothing by Michael Wolff reveals\n\nDonald Trump 's Jewish daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, refused to sign a statement saying Trump was not antisemitic, according to a new book by the veteran Trump tell-all author Michael Wolff.\n\n\"As he kept seeming to be incapable of offering absolute support for Israel in the wake of October 7,\" Wolff writes, referring to the deadly 2023 attacks by Hamas, \"Trump, not for the first time, turned to Jared for Jewish cover, explicitly asking him and Ivanka for a public endorsement.\n\n\"As Trump had continued to waffle, the Washington Post, the campaign understood, was working on a piece that would recycle all the language Trump had variously used over the years, which, on its face, might certainly sound antisemitic. Kushner kept dodging on the formal endorsement of his father-in-law. The campaign then tried to settle for merely a statement from him that his father-in-law was not antisemitic.\"\n\nAccording to Wolff, Kushner finally said: \"No, Ivanka and I aren't going to do that. We're not going to go and put our names on something and get in the middle of things. That's just not what we're going to do this time.\"\n\nKushner and Ivanka Trump were senior advisers to Trump during his first presidency, from 2017 to 2021. But they kept their distance after his attempt to overturn his 2020 electoral defeat to Joe Biden culminated in his supporters' January 6 attack on Congress. The couple have not taken up roles in his second administration after he won back the presidency in November at the expense of former vice-president Kamala Harris, though Kushner has been linked to Trump's controversial plans to depopulate and redevelop the Gaza strip after Israel's relentless assault in response to 7 October.\n\nWolff's book, All or Nothing: How Trump Recaptured America, is his fourth on the president. The new volume was formally confirmed this week, shortly ahead of its US publication on Tuesday. The Guardian obtained a copy.\n\nWolff's first Trump book, Fire and Fury, was released in 2018 and sold millions as Trump tried to block it, kicking off a lucrative rush of Trump-focused books that has shown new signs of life since he won re-election.\n\nWolff followed Fire and Fury with Siege and Landslide. Excerpts from All or Nothing have been published in Vanity Fair and the Daily Beast , the latter detailing what Wolff claims is Melania Trump's \"hatred\" for her husband.\n\nAnnouncing All or Nothing, publisher Crown said: \"Wolff's thesis in his 18 months of covering the campaign was that the establishment would destroy Trump, or Trump would destroy the establishment. All or Nothing is Wolff's panoramic and intimate picture of that battle ... from indictments, to trials, to assassination attempts, to the humiliation and defenestration of a sitting president, to Trump's staggering victory.\"\n\nLast November, as Wolff wrote the book, a group of Trump aides including his chief of staff, Susie Wiles, said: \"A number of us have received inquiries from the disgraced author Michael Wolff , whose previous work can only be described as fiction. He is a known peddler of fake news who routinely concocts situations, conversations, and conclusions that never happened. As a group, we have decided not to respond to his bad faith inquiries, and we encourage others to completely disregard whatever nonsense he eventually publishes. Consider this our blanket response to whatever he writes.\"\n\nOn Friday, the Trump White House's communications director, Steven Cheung, told the Beast : \"Michael Wolff is a lying sack of shit and has been proven to be a fraud.\n\n\"He routinely fabricates stories originating from his sick and warped imagination, only possible because he has a severe and debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has rotted his peanut-sized brain.\"\n\nAmong other moments in All or Nothing sure to be widely discussed, Wolff reports that Trump demanded to know \"what the fuck is wrong with\" Elon Musk, the world's richest person who became a key campaign backer, and called JD Vance, the vice-presidential pick over whom Wolff says Trump had grave doubts, \"shifty, very shifty\".\n\nDescribing a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in October, where Trump survived an assassination attempt in July, Wolff writes: \"And Elon is here, waiting when [Trump's team] arrive[s], which is cause for a moment of consternation ... Elon!

This causes a kerfuffle and results in uncertainty over how to attend to him. Someone produces a bag of pretzel sticks.\n\n\"The suggestion is made that JD is here and would love to speak to him. Musk, sitting down and eating his pretzel sticks, politely declines: 'I've really no interest in speaking to a vice-president.'\n\n\"Later, called onstage, with no one having any idea what he might say, Musk bounds up and, suddenly - in Mick Jagger style, prancing and jumping - becomes the headline, his T-shirt rising far above his midriff.\n\n\"What the fuck is wrong with this guy?\" says a bewildered Trump. \"And why doesn't his shirt fit?\"\n\nElsewhere, Wolff describes Trump's extensive second thoughts about Vance, in one instance reportedly described in a phone conversation with an unnamed confidant.\n\n\"Yeah. What the fuck is with that name-change stuff?\" Trump is depicted as saying. \"How many name changes has he had? That's shifty, that's very shifty. That's my staff fucking up. They know what I think about people changing their names. I think it's shifty. And they didn't tell me.\"\n\nVance was born James Donald Bowman. After his parents split up he was adopted by his new stepfather and renamed James David Hamel. Long known as \"J.D.\", he later changed to his surname to Vance, after the beloved grandmother of whom he writes in Hillbilly Elegy, his bestselling book from 2016. He eventually dropped the periods, to become \"JD\"."

      "text": "Ivanka Trump asked to cooperate with Capitol attack committee\n\nInvestigators seek testimony from former first daughter, with panel increasingly focused on Donald Trump's inner circle\n\nThe House select committee investigating the Capitol attack is asking Ivanka Trump , the daughter of the former president, to appear for a voluntary deposition to answer questions about Donald Trump's efforts to stop the certification of Joe Biden's election victory.\n\nThe move by the panel marks an aggressive new phase in its inquiry into the 6 January insurrection, as House investigators seek for the first time testimony from a member of the Trump family about potential criminality on the part of the former president.\n\nCongressman Bennie Thompson, the chair of the select committee, said in an 11-page letter to Ivanka Trump that the panel wanted to ask about Trump's plan to stop the certification, and his response to the Capitol attack, including delays to deploying the national guard.\n\nIvanka Trump was a senior adviser to her father during his presidency, as was her husband Jared Kushner. The two were seen as a power couple very close to the inner workings of the Trump White House.\n\nThe questions to Ivanka appear directed at a key issue: whether her father oversaw a criminal conspiracy on 6 January that also involved obstructing a congressional proceeding - a crime.\n\nThe letter said that the panel first wanted to question Ivanka Trump about what she recalled of a heated Oval Office meeting on the morning of the 6 January insurrection when the former president was trying to co-opt Mike Pence into rejecting Biden's win.\n\nThe former president was on the phone with the then vice-president in an Oval Office meeting with Ivanka and Keith Kellogg, a top Pence aide, the letter said. When Pence demurred on the former president's repeated request, Ivanka turned to Kellogg and said Pence was \"a good man\".\n\nThompson said in the letter that the panel wanted to learn more about that exchange with Pence she heard, as well as other conversations about impeding the electoral count at the joint session of Congress on 6 January that she may have witnessed or participated in.\n\n\"The committee has information suggesting that President Trump's White House counsel may have concluded that the actions President Trump directed Vice-President Pence to take would ... otherwise be illegal. Did you discuss these issues?\" the letter said.\n\nThompson added House investigators had additional questions about whether Trump could shed light on whether the former president had been told that such an action might be unlawful, and yet nonetheless persisted in pressuring Pence to reinstall him for a second term.\n\nThe letter said the select committee was also interested in learning more from Trump about her father's response to the Capitol attack on 6 January, and discussions inside the White House about the former president's tweet castigating Pence for not adopting his plan.\n\nThompson said the nagging question for Ivanka Trump - who White House aides thought had the best chance of having the former president condemn the rioters - was what she did about the situation and why her father did not call off the rioters in a White House address.\n\nThe select committee said in the letter that they also wanted to ask her about what she knew with regard to the long delay in deploying the national guard to the Capitol, which allowed the insurrection to overwhelm law enforcement into the afternoon of 6 January.\n\nThompson said that House investigators were curious why there appeared to have been no evidence that Trump issued any order to request the national guard, or called the justice department to request the deployment of personnel to the Capitol.\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian and a small group of reporters on Thursday, the chairman of the select committee said that the immediate focus for the investigation was on the former president's daughter and not subpoenas to Republican members of Congress .\n\nThompson said the panel would be \"inviting some people to come and talk to us. Not lawmakers right now. Ivanka Trump.\"\n\nThe letter comes after the US supreme court, in another blow to the former president, late on Wednesday rejected his request to block the release of more than 700 of the most sensitive of White House documents he had tried to hide from the select committee.\n\nThe former president's defeat means those documents - including presidential diaries, notes and memos from the files of top aides including the former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows - that could shed light on the Capitol attack can now be transferred to Congress."

I remember Ivanka saying,\" she wrote. \"'What part of you thinks I would be interested in this?'\"\n\nBeneath her polish, the future president's daughter occasionally betrayed \"rougher, more Trumpian edges\", she wrote. \"Ivanka would regularly relay stories of teachers or observers who had commented that she had the most innate talent they had ever seen for whatever new pursuit she was taking up.\"\n\nOhrstrom, a journalist who used to report from Lebanon, said a necklace with her name in Arabic irked Ivanka. \"One night in the middle of dinner, she glanced at the necklace and said: 'How does your Jewish boyfriend feel when you are having sex and that necklace hits him in the face? How can you wear that thing? It just screams 'terrorist'.\"\n\nOhrstrom befriended Ivanka in seventh grade, when they were about 12, at Chapin, an all-girls school on Manhattan's Upper East Side with famous alumni including Jackie Kennedy Onassis. They bonded during a school trip to Paris and Ohrstrom was a maid of honour at Ivanka's 2009 wedding to Jared Kushner, after which the friendship cooled, she wrote.\n\nMichael Wolff - Fire and Fury\n\nWolff's sensational White House exposé paints Donald Trump as a childlike nonentity. It alleges the self-styled \"very stable genius\" has been described as an idiot by Rupert Murdoch and a moron by Rex Tillerson. Wolff says the thing that interests the US president most is watching himself on television. \"I consider it to be fiction,\" said Trump of the book. Many others were not so sure.\n\nRead the review .\n\nSean Spicer - The Briefing\n\nSean Spicer's 182 days as press secretary yielded a book that tells of a White House where people would routinely bring in \"burner phones\" to avoid being caught leaking, He describes Trump as sometimes being his own worst enemy with his manic tweeting, and recalls his downfall essentially started on day one, when Spicer was responsible for attempts to spin the news on the president's dismal inauguration crowds. Perhaps, though, the highlight is when Spicer describes Trump as \"a unicorn riding a unicorn over a rainbow'.\n\nRead the review .\n\nOmarosa Manigault Newman - Unhinged\n\nThe most prominent African American in the Trump White House before she was abruptly dismissed, Newman spread her criticism liberally. Her description of the vice-president, Mike Pence, as the \"Stepford veep\" is one of the kinder sideswipes.\n\nOf the more jaw-dropping revelations, the suggestion Trump had initially asked to be sworn in over a copy of The Art of the Deal, instead of the Bible, is a hard image to shake.\n\nRead the review .\n\nCliff Sims - Team of Vipers\n\nCliff Sims' book suggested he had made enemies and alienated people throughout the administration. He was particularly scathing about Sarah Sanders, Trump's former press secretary. Her \"gymnastics with the truth\", he said, \"would tax even the nimblest of prevaricators, and Sanders was not that\".\n\nRead the review .\n\nAnonymous - A Warning\n\nFrom a senior official in the Trump administration - and so many have left and fallen out with the president - Trump is described as \"like a 12-year-old in an air traffic control tower\".\n\nThe unknown author adds: \"It's like showing up at the nursing home at daybreak to find your elderly uncle running pants-less across the courtyard and cursing loudly about the cafeteria food, as worried attendants tried to catch him\"\n\nJohn Bolton - The Room Where It Happened\n\nJohn Bolton's damning indictment of the Trump presidency soared up the chart despite withering reviews describing it as \"bloated with self-importance\", after the Trump administration made a last-ditch attempt to prevent its publication.\n\nThe book claimed that Trump pleaded with China to help win the 2020 election, he suggested he was open to serving more than two terms, offered favours to authoritarian leaders, praised Xi for China's internment camps and thought Finland was part of Russia.\n\nOhrstrom said she had written the article to show the true Ivanka, despite the risk of being branded a hypocritical, privileged elitist looking to capitalise on her first family connection.\n\n\"Although friends and family have warned that this article won't be received the way I want, I think it's past time that one of the many critics from Ivanka's childhood comes forward - if only to ensure that she really will never recover from the decision to tie her fate to her father's.\"\n\nWhen Ivanka joined Donald Trump's White House team as an adviser in 2017, Ohrstrom expected her to moderate the president's most regressive, racist tendencies. \"Not out of any moral commitment, but because caging young children and ripping up global climate agreements was not a good look in the halls of Davos,\" she wrote.\n\nIvanka had spent her career projecting a more polished and intellectual version of the Trump brand, blending millennial feminism with a \"mythical narrative\" of business acumen, but this dissolved when she endorsed her father's policies and judicial nominations, said Ohrstrom. \"I've watched as Ivanka has laid waste to the image she worked so hard to build.\"\n\nIt is unclear what Ivanka will do after Joe Biden moves into the White House in January. She shut her eponymous clothing and shoe company in 2018, reportedly over scrutiny and conflict-of-interest issues related to her work with her father's administration.\n\nThere is speculation she may run for public office. In a recent RealClearPolitics interview, she described herself as a \"Trump-Republican\" and \"a pragmatist when it comes to everything\". She came out strongly against abortion, a position shared by the Republican party base. \"I am pro-life, and unapologetically so,\" she said.\n\nThe article claims that Donald Trump paid close attention to the attractiveness of his daughter and her friends when they were teenagers. \"He would barely acknowledge me except to ask if Ivanka was the prettiest or the most popular girl in our grade. Before I learned that the Trumps have no sense of humor about themselves, I remember answering honestly that she was probably in the top five. \"Who's prettier than Ivanka?\" I recall him asking once with genuine confusion, before correctly naming the two girls I'd had in mind.\"\n\nThe future president never remembered Ohrstrom's name but noticed when she gained or lost weight, she wrote. Once, while dining at Mar-a-Lago, Ivanka scolded her brother Donald Jr for taking Ohrstrom's grilled cheese sandwich. Their father chimed in: \"Don't worry. She doesn't need it. He's doing her a favor.\""

When people see that others are doing the right thing, it gives them the courage to do the right thing.\"\n\nA bipartisan Senate report linked seven deaths to the attack on the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, by supporters Donald Trump told to \"fight like hell\" in service of his attempt to overturn his defeat by Joe Biden.\n\nTrump was impeached for inciting an insurrection but acquitted when enough Republican senators stayed loyal.\n\nThe House's January 6 committee includes two Republicans, Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois.\n\nAs the Guardian reported this week, the committee has identified Ivanka Trump as a senior adviser who would have known her father's attempt to block certification of electoral college results at the Capitol was unlawful.\n\nReferring to a law professor who presented the plan to block certification, a federal judge recently said it was \"more likely than not that President Trump and Dr [John] Eastman dishonestly conspired to obstruct the joint session of Congress on January 6 2021\", and thereby committed multiple felonies.\n\nAlso in Washington on Tuesday, Enrique Tarrio, a former leader of the far-right Proud Boys group, pleaded not guilty to felony charges including conspiracy to block the certification by Congress of electoral college results on January 6.\n\nThe January 6 committee also hopes Ivanka Trump might help explain a more-than seven-hour gap in White House call logs for the day of the Capitol attack.\n\nIvanka Trump's role in her father's administration has long been a lightning rod for controversy. On Monday, the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew) said : \"Here's a question Ivanka Trump can answer: how did she and Jared make up to $640m while working 'for free' in the White House?\""

      "text": "Ivanka Trump fraud trial testimony: what we've learned at a glance\n\nTrump's eldest daughter repeatedly asked about acquiring loans for her father\n\nIvanka Trump took the stand on Wednesday morning in the New York civil fraud lawsuit against her father Donald Trump and brothers Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump. Louis Solomon, who questioned her for the attorney general's office, repeatedly asked about acquiring loans for her father. Much of the questioning was granular, involving discussions of interest rates, for example, but some moments revealed bankers' concern about giving Trump loans.\n\nIvanka Trump repeatedly said she didn't recall when asked about details involving correspondences about loans.\n\nDeutsche Bank was wary of loaning Trump money due to the 2016 campaign. The court heard how one Deutsche banker, responding to a request for an unsecured loan, told Ivanka Trump in an email: \"As for doing any large unsecured amounts, I think that would raise too [many] eyebrows given the political environment.\" The banker also said: \"At the end, it came down to a global corporate decision to maintain neutrality to any political situation and not lend money to a highly politically exposed person.\"\n\nAlso in the context of a request for an unsecured loan, Deutsche Bank was concerned about whether Trump had free cash. \"I think it would be difficult since we do not have any large unsecured amounts such as this request in the entire [private banking] portfolio and this would certainly be an outlier,\" the banker said in an email to Ivanka. Among Deutsche's concerns, \"for that amount, it would look as if liquidity is an issue\" for Trump.\n\nIvanka Trump insisted that the Trump Organization intended to revamp his golf resort in Doral, south Florida. This is important in discussion of valuations. If Trump wanted to claim that assets weren't overblown - because of the potential value due to improvements - he'd have to show intention to do that. So, if the attorney general shows that there wasn't really an intention, it suggests that the assets were knowingly overvalued. \"I think it was our intention, regardless, to renovate throughout ... the reason we bought the property was because we believed in its potential, to be something better than it was,\" she claimed.\n\nIvanka said at various points that she didn't know much about accounting. She said she'd learned about GAAP, \"generally accepted accounting principals,\" in school, but didn't do much with it in her working life.\n\nOn cross-examination, Trump lawyer Jesus Suarez tried vehemently to convey that Deutsche Bank was chasing after the family's business--to suggest that the ex-president wasn't securing loans through spurious financials. Deutsche Bank wanted the Trumps, so they didn't need to woo the lender fraudulently. Ivanka Trump said that Deutsche approached Trump with investment opportunities from time to time, and described a \"level of excitement for the relationship and positive feelings.\"\n\nAnd, as per usual with this case, Trump's lawyers complained about alleged unfairness and accused the government laughing at them. \"I have to sit here and ask questions and listen to them laugh-- that's insulting, your honor,\" Suarez boomed, pointing at the government table. \"They're laughing! They're sitting back here laughing. They think this is funny.\"\n\nJames' office said that they were not calling any more witnesses, but reserved the right to bring Allen Weisselberg back on the stand . The defense is expected to start presenting its case on Monday."

She Should Be Asked Tough Questions.\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nInstead, CBS \"Face the Nation\" host Margaret Brennan asked Ivanka, \"How's your father's mood?\"\n\nIvanka Trump during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House on Dec. 19, 2019, in Washington, D.C. Photo: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images The morning after Donald Trump became only the third president in U.S. history to be impeached, his senior adviser Ivanka Trump - who also doubles as his eldest daughter - sat down for a rare interview with CBS \"Face The Nation\" host Margaret Brennan.\n\nIvanka Trump during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House on Dec. 19, 2019, in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"Face the Nation\" has been on air since 1954 and is considered to be one of the most prestigious and high-profile interview shows on American television. Yet Brennan's interview with Ivanka - which was released in full on Sunday morning, and pegged to the new policy of paid parental leave for federal government workers - could be considered a low point in the show's storied 65-year history.\n\nDon't believe me? Here are three of the first four questions that Brennan asked Ivanka about her father's historic impeachment:\n\nAt one point, referring to Trump's deranged six-page letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in which he referenced the Salem witch trials , Brennan told Ivanka that her father \"seemed angry.\"\n\nAre you kidding me? Is this what CBS and Brennan consider to be journalism? Holding power to account? Asking tough questions?\n\nSeriously?\n\nFor much of the interview, the \"Face The Nation\" host treated Ivanka not as a senior White House adviser and one of the president's closest confidantes, but as a cross between a \"first daughter\" invited onto the show to offer insights into her dad's feelings and a political pundit invited onto the show to offer random observations on the impeachment process.\n\nFor example, rather than challenging this senior Trump administration official on the president's refusal to comply with congressional subpoenas or allow senior White House staff to testify in front of the House or Senate, Brennan asked Ivanka only for her opinion . \"Do you think that this should be a trial with witnesses and new evidence?\"\n\nTo quote liberal writer Eric Boehlert, \"for most Sunday shows, the blueprint remains the same: book a Republican and let them talk.\" When Brennan asked Ivanka to address the cruel and callous policy of family separation at the border and the \"900 children who remain separated from their families,\" the senior adviser to the president dodged the question, claiming \"immigration is not part of my portfolio,\" before quickly changing the subject to human trafficking. Yet there was no follow-up, no pushback whatsoever, from the \"Face the Nation\" host.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nEarlier this month, Ivanka was mocked for refusing to be interviewed by a journalist at the Doha Forum in Qatar, despite other world leaders and foreign government officials agreeing to do so. Sitting on stage in the Gulf, the senior White House adviser agreed to take questions only from a State Department spokesperson.\n\nHere are a couple of the questions she was asked by the spokesperson, Morgan Ortagus:\n\nEmbarrassing, right? But is there really any substantive difference between these ridiculous \"questions\" from Ortagus, a former Fox News contributor , and the questions posed to Ivanka by award-winning Sunday morning host Margaret Brennan? In fact, to describe Brennan's questions as softballs would be an insult to the great sport that was invented two years after Ivanka's great-grandfather immigrated to the United States from Germany in 1885.\n\nSo here are a dozen better, and much tougher, questions that Margaret Brennan could - and should - have asked senior White House adviser Ivanka Trump on \"Face the Nation.\"\n\n1. You have criticized House Democrats for calling witnesses who \" didn't have firsthand knowledge \" of the issues under investigation. So why didn't your father allow Mick Mulvaney , the White House chief of staff, to testify in the House?\n\n2. Do you believe it is appropriate for U.S. political leaders to call on foreign governments to dig up dirt on the children of their opponents? Would you be OK with the Democratic presidential candidate in 2020 calling on, say, the Iranians to investigate you and your brothers?\n\n3. You mentioned your father's \" mood \" at the rally in Michigan on the night of the House impeachment vote, but would you be willing to apologize on his behalf to Rep. Debbie Dingell for suggesting, at that rally, that her late husband, John Dingell, might be in hell ?\n\n4. You said the president doesn't \" even feel like he was being impeached ,\" but what happened to that popular conservative adage: 'Facts don't care about your feelings?'\"\n\n5. You say the Democratic approach to paid parental leave has \" grown stale \" but don't these new parental leave benefits for government employees more \" closely resemble ... the FAMILY Act ,\" proposed by Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro, D-Conn., and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., than anything you or the Republicans came up with? Isn't the truth that it was congressional Democrats who used your father's \" desire for a Space Force to extract funding for the new paid leave policy \"?\n\n6. Do you think it is hypocritical that you are here today on this show to promote this new policy of paid parental leave for government workers while the contractor that designed your own for-profit clothing line \" does not offer workers a single day of paid maternity leave \"?\n\n7. You said a moment ago that \" the fourth person I hired was pregnant when I hired her. So we put a policy [of paid leave] in place for her .\" But she disagrees with you, doesn't she? Your former chief marketing officer Marissa Kraxberger has written that she and her colleagues had to fight \" long and hard to get [you] to finally agree to 8 weeks paid maternity leave .\"\n\n8. You are speaking today as a senior adviser to the president on women's empowerment , so what do you say to at least 25 different women who have accused your father, the president, of sexual harassment and assault? What's your response, in particular, to the accusation this past summer from the writer E. Jean Carroll that your father raped her in a department store changing room?\n\n9. What do you think qualifies you to be a senior adviser to the president of the United States, and participate in talks with the leader of North Korea, given your background is in clothing and fashion?\n\n10. What do you think qualifies your husband to be a senior adviser to the president of the United States, and a Middle East peace negotiator , given his background is in real estate?\n\n11. In July 2018, you announced you were shutting down your clothing business to focus on your White House role advising your father, so why were you still getting trademarks from the Chinese government in November 2018? And how are all these trademarks not a massive conflict of interest ?\n\n12. You told ABC News that your father had \" no involvement \" in the granting of controversial security clearances to you and your husband, and yet we have since learned that Trump personally pushed for you both to be given clearances, against the advice of his then-chief of staff John Kelly and then-White House counsel Don McGahn. You weren't telling the truth in that ABC News interview, were you?\n\nBack in March 2018, I described Norah O'Donnell's CBS \"60 Minutes\" interview with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known by his initials MBS, as a \" crime against journalism .\" It was, I argued, soft, superficial, and fawning.\n\nBut Brennan's fact-free, kid-glove approach to Ivanka on \"Face the Nation\" this past weekend makes O'Donnell's sit-down with MBS look like an interrogation.\n\nSo what is wrong with these highly paid, high-profile TV journalists and their bosses over at CBS News? Has their obsession with access, and with ratings, made them abandon the very concept and purpose of political journalism? Of TV interviews?\n\nMaybe we shouldn't be surprised. Remember what then-CBS executive chairman and CEO, Les Moonves, said about the rise of Trump in February 2016? \"It may not be good for America,\" he declared, \"but it's damn good for CBS.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Ivanka Trump Backed Flynn and Manafort. She Discussed Firing Comey. How Has She Evaded Mueller's Investigation?\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe first daughter's questionable judgment in business and politics deserves more attention from the special counsel and the mainstream press.\n\nIvanka Trump is the ghost of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation: She is connected, either directly or tangentially, to events at the heart of the probe, yet all but invisible to the public.\n\nBut as Mueller's investigation broadens , the so-called first daughter is becoming a long overdue part of the bigger story of alleged corruption at the Trump Organization. Last week, we learned that the FBI is looking into the financing and negotiations surrounding her involvement with Trump International Hotel and Tower in Vancouver, which is home to an Ivanka Trump-branded spa. That inquiry may be unrelated to the Russia probe, but it should draw scrutiny to Ivanka's business dealings and how they relate to her father's political rise.\n\nThe mainstream press frequently describes Ivanka - who recently denied any collusion between Donald Trump's campaign and the Russians - as the head of a fashion company. Yet she was also a top executive at the Trump Organization and a hard-charging, and often quite effective, dealmaker for the real estate development company. Despite her entrenched role in the West Wing and status as one of her father's most trusted advisers and emissaries on matters as wide-ranging as G-20 and the Winter Olympics, her identity - carefully curated on social media and through her press operation - hinges on issues such as female entrepreneurship , maternal leave, and being a mother to highly Instagrammable kids. It's a persona that renders the media establishment and broader public largely incapable of considering that she might be a key player in the Trump-Russia narrative.\n\nThe first daughter has not merely developed some of her father's Teflon quality; sexism and gender stereotypes have also worked in her favor. After all, who would suspect an ex-model, mother of three, and public champion of working women to be pulling the levers of power, calling the shots, and working alongside people like Felix Sater , a Russian-American businessman with reputed mob ties who served jail time for stabbing a man in a bar fight?\n\nMueller's probe is scrutinizing Trump's business transactions. Although we don't know the full scope of the investigation, Ivanka was reportedly among just a handful of people with a role in foreign projects at the Trump Organization.\n\nSenior Adviser to the President Stephen Miller, left, and Ivanka Trump, adviser and daughter of Donald Trump, walk across the South Lawn after returning to the White House on Aug. 30, 2017.\n\nShe also appears to have been present, albeit briefly, at a controversial meeting aboard Air Force One on the way back from the G-20 summit in July, when Trump administration staffers and the president himself drafted a response to reporters' questions about a meeting with Kremlin-linked lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin. The statement, now exposed as a cover-up , said the meeting was focused on Russian adoption when it was really to discuss potentially damaging information on Hillary Clinton. Ivanka, according to \"Fire and Fury\" author Michael Wolff, attended the Air Force One gathering, which is now reportedly of interest to Mueller. The first daughter's team told Wolff that she quickly left the meeting to \"take a pill, and go to sleep\" - a timeline that works in Ivanka's favor, giving her what Wolff describes as a \"get out of jail free card.\"\n\nAt other times, however, Ivanka has indisputably been more present. She was one of three people - along with her husband, Jared Kushner, and Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller - whom the president consulted before deciding to fire then-FBI director James Comey. Their motive for encouraging Comey's ouster, Wolff claims, was fear for their own fortunes: Ivanka and Kushner were influenced by Jared's father Charlie Kushner's \"panic\" that the \"Kushner family's dealings were getting wrapped up in the pursuit of Trump.\" The couple, whom Wolff dubs \"Jarvanka,\" became, in his words, \"co-conspirators\" in the Comey firing, which is being investigated as a possible obstruction of justice, an impeachable offense.\n\nAnd it was Ivanka who went to bat for Paul Manafort, the former lobbyist indicted by Mueller on 12 counts of tax evasion, foreign lobbying, and laundering $75 million in payments as part of a pro-Russian initiative in Ukraine, as well as new charges filed last month. Ivanka reportedly printed out Manafort's pitch letter and gave it to her father because she and Kushner thought Manafort would \"bring professionalism\" to the campaign.\n\nIvanka was also a champion of former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. In a 2016 meeting of the Trump transition team's executive committee , Ivanka asked Flynn: \"General, what job do you want?\" \"It was like Princess Ivanka had laid the sword on Flynn's shoulders and said, 'Rise and go forth,'\" the New Yorker's Jane Mayer reported . (Flynn pleaded guilty in December to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russian officials and is now cooperating with Mueller.)\n\nDonald Trump and real estate developers Tevfik Arif and Felix Sater attend the Trump SoHo launch party on Sept. 19, 2007 in New York.\n\nThen there are Ivanka's ties to Felix Sater, who has loudly and plausibly boasted of connections with senior Russian officials. Sater is now being called one of the Trump Organization's \"biggest headaches in the Russia probe\" because of a letter he wrote to Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen in 2015, saying: \"Our boy can become president of the USA and we can engineer it. I will get all of Putin's team to buy in on this, I will manage this process.\" Sater claimed that he had arranged financing for Trump Tower Moscow, a never-built project that was supposed to be the linchpin of the support from \"Putin's team.\" The skyscraper included plans for an Ivanka-branded spa .\n\nIvanka was close enough with Sater that she traveled to Moscow with him in 2006. Sater claims he arranged for Ivanka to sit in Putin's office chair at the Kremlin. (Ivanka told the New York Times that she may have sat in Putin's chair, but \"she did not recall it.\") And Bayrock, the company where Sater was managing director, helped finance Trump SoHo , a lower Manhattan condo and hotel project that Ivanka oversaw. (She was close to being charged with felony fraud for inflating the building's sales figures.)\n\nThis series of events and decisions might help explain why former Trump administration chief strategist Steve Bannon labeled Ivanka and Kushner \"Russia Toxic,\" according to Wolff. The author says this was Bannon's way of warning his White House colleagues not to speak to the couple lest they jeopardize their careers by getting entangled in Mueller's investigation.\n\n\"Why is he [Mueller] not interviewing Ivanka?\" asked CNN legal analyst Michael Zeldin, a former prosecutor who worked for Mueller at the Justice Department. \"The answer is, beats me. Either he's just biding his time or he has obtained this evidence elsewhere and he doesn't need her, or he appreciates the possibility of a major eruption were he to do that.\"\n\nIvanka may have plausible deniability when it comes to events like the infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer, and Akhmetshin, the lobbyist. The first daughter did not attend the meeting, though she may have run into the Russians near the elevators afterwards and exchanged what have been described as \"pleasantries.\" But a brief conversation with shady Russian nationals hardly proves that she colluded with the Kremlin.\n\nTrump Campaign Chair Paul Manafort speaks to Ivanka Trump, daughter of then-Republican nominee Donald Trump at the Republican Convention, July 21, 2016 at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nOn the personnel matters, it's a different story. Even a cursory Google search would have turned up Paul Manafort's connections to some of the world's foremost kleptocrats and his links to Russia, particularly a business relationship with and large alleged debt to aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska, who was named in a U.S. diplomatic cable as \"among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis.\"\n\nAs for Flynn, who would serve as Trump's national security adviser for only 24 days, he told the transition team before the inauguration that he was under federal investigation for working as a paid lobbyist for Turkey during the campaign.\n\nChampioning Manafort and Flynn does not amount to a crime, but it remains an open question why Ivanka ignored red flags about these two men. The infantilizing answer is that she simply doesn't know enough about the inner workings of government and criminal liability to understand that Flynn and Manafort posed imminent threats to her father's campaign, his administration, and national security. Or it could be that her judgment was disastrously poor.\n\nIn his post-mortem of the Comey firing and attempt aboard Air Force One to craft a false account of the Trump Tower meeting, Wolff concludes that \"everyone on the Jarvanka side were now directly connected to actions involved in the Russia investigation or efforts to spin it, deflect, or, indeed, cover it up.\" Yet reporters of all stripes have largely given Ivanka a free pass on matters Russia-related. Wolff is in a minority for zeroing in on Ivanka's role in the Comey firing, which triggered Mueller's appointment in the first place.\n\nFrom left, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, National Economic Council Chair Gary Cohn, National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, Senior Adviser to President Donald Trump, Jared Kushner, and Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter, listen to translation during Trump's joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in the East Room of the White House, in Washington, Friday, Feb. 10, 2017.\n\nIvanka's absence from the nonstop coverage of the Russia investigation may be linked to her longstanding special relationship with the mainstream press, not to mention surrogates who spend hours on the phone with reporters buffering her image. Wolff claims that Josh Raffel, Jared and Ivanka's spokesperson, \"coordinated all of Kushner's substantial leaking\" and that the leaking culture at the White House is so \"open and overt\" that \"everybody could identify everybody else's leaks.\" It stands to reason that reporters, all competing for the next scoop, would be loath to jeopardize their access to the palace intrigue that makes the Trump White House such juicy copy. That's why, even though journalists whisper about it among themselves, no one will go on the record to say that Ivanka and her PR machine are key sources for White House gossip and more. As one senior White House staffer told Wolff, Jared and Ivanka \"are so careful about their image and have crafted this whole persona - it's like anyone who tries to pierce it or say something against it is like a big problem. They get very upset and will come after you.\"\n\nThe result is that the press often spins events in Ivanka's favor. After the white supremacist rally and subsequent violence in Charlottesville, the New York Times reported that Jared and Ivanka were urging Donald Trump to \"take a more moderate stance.\" After Trump announced the transgender military ban, Ivanka got the word out that she had only learned about it on Twitter, distancing herself from the discriminatory policy proposal.\n\nAs Drew Magary put it in a piece for GQ called \"Michael Wolff Did What Every Other White House Reporter Is Too Cowardly To Do,\" Wolff burned many of his sources, while the rest of the media, Magary writes, \"are abiding by traditional wink-wink understandings that have long existed between the government and the press covering it.\" While Magary notes that Wolff \"represents the absolute worst of New York media-cocktail-circuit inbreeding,\" mainstream reporters are equally guilty for their kid-glove treatment of Ivanka.\n\nThat gives a whole new meaning to \"collusion\" - one that benefits the first daughter.\n\nTop photo: U.S. Sen.

      "text": "Steven Mnuchin Stepped In to Prevent Ivanka Trump World Bank Appointment\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nPresident Donald Trump very much wanted Ivanka at the helm, and it was the Treasury secretary who blocked her ascent.\n\nIn January 2019, Jim Yong Kim threw the global financial development sector into a state of disarray: The former academic and health official announced he would be stepping down the following month from his role as president of the World Bank, opting instead for a cushier gig at a Wall Street private equity firm. For an institution that was already struggling with heightened competition from China and private capital , Kim's departure - which came as a total surprise - was seen as a setback, as it handed an opportunity to choose a new leader to President Donald Trump, creating worries that the America First champion would pick somebody ill suited for the global role.\n\nAs the White House moved to select its new leader, one name very dear to Trump's heart kept floating around: his daughter Ivanka Trump. That never came to fruition, though, with Ivanka later telling reporters that though her father had raised the subject, she declined to pursue the position as she was \"happy with the work\" she was doing as his senior adviser .\n\nIvanka Trump did, however, aid Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney in the selection process. When the Treasury Department announced Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs David Malpass as the World Bank's new president, Ivanka released a statement predicting Malpass would be \"an extraordinary leader of the World Bank.\" (Malpass was in fact a controversial pick, due in large part to his past criticisms of the World Bank.)\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nBut two sources, not authorized to speak publicly, tell The Intercept the talk of Ivanka at the helm went far beyond the realm of Beltway chatter: Trump very much wanted Ivanka as World Bank president, and it was Mnuchin who actually blocked her ascent to the leadership role.\n\n\"It came incredibly close to happening,\" said one well-placed source.\n\nRepresentatives for Mnuchin and Ivanka Trump did not respond to requests for comment, nor did the World Bank or the Trump Organization.\n\nSince the World Bank's creation in 1944, the U.S. has always led the prerogative to name the bank's president in an informal agreement with European leaders, who are given the job of naming the head of the International Monetary Fund (an arrangement that rather bluntly underscores the Western imperial nature of the international financial institutions).\n\nPrior to her role at White House adviser, Ivanka spent 12 years at the Trump Organization as executive vice president of development and acquisitions. She also launched her own line of fashion products which, according to 2019 financial disclosures , reportedly brought in between $100,000 and $1,000,000 in rent or royalties.\n\nOnce in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Ivanka helped launch the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative, colloquially known as the \"Ivanka Fund\": a World Bank-supported project to raise money for female entrepreneurs in developing nations. It was her work on the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative that White House spokesperson Jessica Ditto cited in explaining Ivanka's qualification for selecting the next World Bank leader. \"She's worked closely with the World Bank's leadership for the past two years,\" Ditto said.\n\nBut that initiative still left her pretty light on experience. \"That's a very thin base to try to establish credibility in this multilateral institution,\" said Scott Morris, director of the U.S. development policy program at the Center for Global Development in D.C. \"It's hard to imagine that she would have been viewed as a credible leader. It would be the worst kind of exercise of U.S. power. I have to think as a candidate she would have encountered some resistance. But maybe [the bank's members] would not have wanted to provoke the U.S. president.\"\n\nFrom the moment her father won the presidential election, Ivanka has been wrapped up in controversy: She falsely testified that she was uninvolved in the 2017 inauguration (a lawsuit alleged that the Inaugural Committee overpaid for event space at the Trump International Hotel in D.C.); she and her husband, fellow presidential adviser Jared Kushner, earned hundreds of millions in outside income while working in the White House; and her Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative was ultimately a flop .\n\nMnuchin often placed himself between the president and what the Treasury secretary saw as colossally counterproductive moves. His time as a Hollywood producer - making him a representative of the set whose approval Trump craved - gave him influence that others in the administration lacked. He pushed Trump to name Jerome Powell as head of the Federal Reserve and routinely talked him out of random government shutdowns. His successful effort to talk Trump into backing and signing the CARES Act was among his other significant achievements. He also had a habit of dodging responsibility for Trump's worst excesses. On January 6, he made sure that he was in Sudan.\n\nBut given that there's a growing discontent among the World Bank's member nations over the U.S.'s unilateral ability to nominate the institution's leadership, the Ivanka saga could serve as a warning against the status quo. \"A growing number of countries don't like this whole arrangement,\" said Morris. \"For them to hear how close it was to being the U.S. president's daughter probably adds fuel to the fire that the Americans are so cavalier about this.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Trump's Lack of Transparency Again Exposed by the Routine Openness of a Foreign Leader\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nWithout explanation, the president-elect's daughter keeps turning up when her father talks to world leaders.\n\nDonald Trump's daughter Ivanka, who will soon be running his global business empire, took part in her father's first official discussion with the president of Argentina last week, according to the Argentine leader.\n\nPresident Mauricio Macri of Argentina told the Asahi Shimbun , a Japanese newspaper, that he had spoken with Ivanka Trump when he called her father to congratulate him on his victory in the U.S. presidential election.\n\nIt was the second time in a week that Americans only learned that the president-elect's daughter had been involved in her father's talks with a world leader because of the routine transparency of a foreign government.\n\nOn Thursday, after Trump barred reporters from attending his meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, photographs released by the Japanese government showed that Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, were present for the meeting at Trump Tower.\n\nIvanka Trump sat in on her father's meeting today with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, per handout photo pic.twitter.com/tEbfYYeJFA\n\n- Jennifer Epstein (@jeneps) November 18, 2016\n\nJared Kushner was also there (and Gen. Flynn) https://t.co/480y1rWy2A pic.twitter.com/mC2tTu95i6\n\n- Jennifer Epstein (@jeneps) November 18, 2016\n\nTrump's transition office has released no details of his call with Macri but denied an Argentine journalist's report that the president-elect had used the opportunity to ask for help in getting a building permit from the Buenos Aires city council for a Trump Office tower.\n\nA spokesperson for Macri also denied the allegation that Trump had asked for a business favor during the call, but, according to Uki Goñi of The Guardian, the original source was someone on Macri's staff.\n\nThe claim was first made on Sunday's edition of \"Journalism for Everyone,\" a popular television program hosted by Jorge Lanata. That program has some comic elements, but it previous reporting includes a corruption investigation that led to criminal charges against a business partner of former President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner.\n\nAt the start of his show on Sunday night, Lanata told the audience that he had inside information on what Macri was asked to do during the call. \"Trump asked him to authorize a building he's constructing in Buenos Aires,\" Lanata said, \"it wasn't just geopolitical chat.\"\n\nLater in the show, the journalist who broke the story, Romina Manguel, explained that Trump's business partners in Argentina, Felipe Yaryura and Moses Yellati of the YY Development Group, are trying to get permission to build a 35-story tower, Trump Office Buenos Aires , on the city's July 9 Avenue.\n\nAs Susan Simpson , a Washington lawyer and blogger who is an expert on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, pointed out, earlier reports in the Argentine press said that Macri's call to the president-elect was facilitated by Yaryura, Trump's business partner in the Buenos Aires project.\n\nBack on Nov 14, Argentine media was reporting that Pres Macri's call to Trump was arranged thru TrumpTower investor: https://t.co/l5MWKxXns0\n\n- Susan Simpson (@TheViewFromLL2) November 21, 2016\n\nYaryura, Simpson notes, is close enough to the Trump family to have spent election night with them in New York.\n\nTrump's Argentina partners include Yaryura & Yellati. They were in \"the bunker\" on the night of the election, and chilled with Eric Trump. pic.twitter.com/E3k4Zop1q9\n\n- Susan Simpson (@TheViewFromLL2) November 22, 2016\n\nAs world leaders scrambled to find ways to contact Trump - and Australia's prime minister, for instance, managed to get the celebrity developer's phone number from the golfer Greg Norman - Macri was reportedly anxious to make contact, in part because he had openly supported Hillary Clinton during the election campaign.\n\nSince Trump has apparently been conducting these calls with foreign leaders on unsecured phone lines - after devoting much of the campaign to complaining about Clinton's use of a private email account during her time as secretary of state - it seems possible that at least one foreign government might possess a recording of the conversation with Macri. If Trump did ask Macri about a building permit for his tower, anyone with audio of those remarks would seem to have leverage over the incoming president.\n\nIn an odd twist, Macri himself is a former business associate of Trump's. In the 1980s, the current Argentine president's father, Franco, who was a developer, was involved in a complex New York real estate deal with Trump, as Wayne Barrett explained in his book \" Trump: The Greatest Show on Earth .\"\n\nAlthough Jason Miller, a spokesperson for Trump, insisted Manguel's reporting on the call was inaccurate, the fact that Ivanka Trump took part in the discussion renewed questions about whether the family has taken any steps to prevent its business interests from mingling with those of the government her father is about to lead.\n\nTrump has promised to have Ivanka and her brothers, Donald Jr. and Eric, run his company during his presidency, but even he has admitted that this arrangement would not be the sort of \"blind trust\" every president for the past four decades has used to prevent their financial interests from conflicting with those of the country. Since Trump has ignored the precedent that all candidates for the White House should make their financial interests public, by releasing their tax returns, it is difficult for the public to know what conflicts he might have.\n\nAs Richard Painter and Norman Eisen, who served as the chief White House ethics lawyers for President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, explained in the Washington Post :\n\nA blind trust is defined by federal law as one in which a federal official selects an independent trustee (with no familial ties) who sells the official's known assets and purchases investments unknown to the official. That is what makes it blind.\n\nThe president-elect and his spokespeople have instead suggested that he will allow his children to guide his enterprises while he retains all or most of the ownership interest. This arrangement has two major flaws. First, Trump will know what is in the trust. (He cannot put Trump Tower in a blind trust and then forget that he owns it.) Second, he knows the people who will be managing the assets; he is their father. This is the opposite of a blind trust. It is a demand that the American people blindly trust Trump and his family.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times on Monday, Painter added that, unless Trump liquidates his assets before his inauguration, he would be in danger of violating the Emoluments Clause, a provision of the Constitution that bars federal office holders from accepting any kind of compensation or gift \"from any king, prince or foreign state.\"\n\nTrump is known to have a number of financial relationships with companies controlled by foreign governments.\n\nFor his part, Trump seemed to dismiss concerns about his entanglements as unimportant in an angry tweet late on Monday in which he blamed the media for making \"a big deal\" of his lack of any plan to deal with the conflicts.\n\nPrior to the election it was well known that I have interests in properties all over the world.Only the crooked media makes this a big deal!\n\n- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2016\n\nWAIT!

McMaster.\n\nThat Trump chose, instead, to seat his daughter, Ivanka, alongside the other 19 heads of state, was perhaps the most stunning illustration to date that he sees a complete lack of experience in affairs of state as no barrier at all to treating her as his de facto vice president.\n\nI understand Ivanka Trump is sitting at the #G20 leaders table this morning instead of US President Donald Trump.\n\nSource: \"Incredible!!!\"\n\n- Alberto Nardelli (@AlbertoNardelli) July 8, 2017\n\nThe first daughter's presence at the main table was confirmed in a photograph shared on Twitter - and later deleted from the social network - by Svetlana Lukash, Russian President Vladimir Putin's representative to the G20.\n\nThe image shows that German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkey's President Recip Tayyip Erdogan were seated close by during the first daughter's cameo.\n\nA White House official tried to play down the incident, telling Agence France-Presse that Ivanka had just \"briefly joined the main table when the President had to step out.\"\n\nHowever, an official who was in the room told Bloomberg News that she had taken Trump's place on at least two separate occasions.\n\nMerkel, who somehow managed to get elected Germany's leader despite not being an heiress, played down the incident when asked about it later.\n\n\"She works at the White House & is engaged in certain initiatives\" - Angela Merkel on Ivanka Trump at leaders' table https://t.co/1UvsKIrTu9 pic.twitter.com/SNRSdbzV01\n\n- BBC News (World) (@BBCWorld) July 8, 2017\n\nAmerican observers, however, were less willing to overlook the implications of the blatant nepotism.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/xeni/status/883697335548518400\n\nUnelected and unqualified hand bag designer, sitting at a table as an equal with world leaders.

Polls conducted the same year showed that 89 percent of Tunisians and 88 percent of Qataris agreed that \"the Palestinian cause concerns all Arabs.\" Just 6 percent of Saudis surveyed said they would support recognition of Israel.\n\n\"To our beloved Palestine, the most beautiful of all countries\"\n\nMorocco World Cup fans sing in solidarity with Palestine in Qatar.

It's only Palestine. And you just took the land from them. ... Bro, there is nothing called Israel. Israel does not exist.\"\n\nIn an ensuing thread on his experiences in Qatar, Alsaafin wrote, Shechnik \"demonstrated his delusion in thinking Arabs in particular would be welcoming just [because] some of their governments normalised relations with Israel.\"\n\n\"Israeli journalists say they were surprised at the level of enmity that they faced in Qatar at the World Cup,\" Daoud Kuttab, a Palestinian journalist, added. \"I am surprised that they are surprised since what they are doing daily in Palestine is all over the world media (except in Israel maybe) but every action has a reaction.\"\n\nOriginal reporting.

Kosovo, which is in the Balkans and not the Middle East, is a former province of Serbia where ethnic Albanian Muslims make up a majority. The republic did not strike a peace deal with Israel - for the very good reason that it had never been at war with Israel - but did agree to open an embassy in Jerusalem as part of an economic deal with Serbia brokered by the Trump White House and signed in Kushner's presence.\n\nEven though there was only a brief mention of Israel in the agreement signed by Kosovo's prime minister in Washington in September 2020, and the economic cooperation with Serbia it enshrined was minor, Trump described it at a campaign event that month as a \"major breakthrough\" that - along with the deals between Israel, Bahrain, and the UAE - might help him win the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nTrump on ?? - ?? deal\n\n\"We are stopping MASS KILLINGS between Kosovo and Serbia.

      "text": "The U.S. Government Has Become the Ultimate Extension of Donald Trump's For-Profit Brand\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nA new lawsuit says Donald Trump is profiting off the presidency. That doesn't begin to capture the heist underway.\n\nDonald Trump and his family, from left, son Donald Trump Jr., son Eric Trump, wife Melania Trump, and daughters Tiffany Trump and Ivanka Trump cut the ribbon at the Trump International Hotel on Oct. 26, 2016, in Washington. Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images In a lawsuit filed today , the attorneys general of the state of Maryland and the District of Columbia claim that by accepting millions of dollars and countless more perks from foreign governments, President Trump is at the center of an \"unprecedented constitutional violation.\" Whether it's $270,000 in payments from a lobbying firm working for the Saudi government or praise from the Ambassador of Georgia (also a paying customer), Trump's hotels and properties continue to rake it in from governments across the globe, from Turkey to Kuwait to India to Afghanistan to Qatar.\n\nDonald Trump and his family, from left, son Donald Trump Jr., son Eric Trump, wife Melania Trump, and daughters Tiffany Trump and Ivanka Trump cut the ribbon at the Trump International Hotel on Oct. 26, 2016, in Washington.\n\nThe attorneys general claim that \"President Trump's personal fortune is at stake,\" whenever he makes a policy decision, whether it be about taxes, climate change, or foreign relations - a troubling notion, to say the least. According to the lawsuit, Trump's continued entanglement in his business violates the constitutional emolument clause that, in theory, prevents the president from taking payments from foreign governments. The lawsuit is damning, saying, \"never before has a President acted with such disregard for this constitutional prescription.\"\n\nTrump, of course, still profits directly from his business dealings, since he has not divested from his business holdings in any way.\n\nI've spent the last five months researching the Trump family's global brand-based empire and the various ways that the president has turned the U.S. government into the ultimate extension of his for-profit brand, so far without any repercussion. So it's good to see the law starting to catch up. But the lawsuit touches on a fraction of the ways in which Trump is actively profiting from the presidency. As I write in the introduction to \"No Is Not Enough,\" we are seeing this unprecedented level of self-dealing because Trump's business model is itself relatively new, and certainly a first for a sitting president:\n\nTrump was never the head of a traditional company but has, rather, long been the figurehead of an empire built around his personal brand - one that has, along with his daughter Ivanka's brand, already benefited from its merger with the U.S. presidency in countless ways (membership rates at Mar-a-Lago have doubled; Ivanka's product sales, we are told, are through the roof). The Trump family's business model is part of a broader shift in corporate structure that has taken place within many brand-based multinationals, one with transformative impacts on culture and the job market.\n\nWhat this model tells us is that the very idea that there could be - or should be - any distinction between the Trump brand and the Trump presidency is a concept the current occupant of the White House cannot begin to comprehend. The presidency is the crowning extension of the Trump brand.\n\nWe are in entirely uncharted territory, because let's face it: human megabrands are a relatively new phenomenon. There's no rulebook that foresaw any of this. People keep asking - is he going to divest? Is he going to sell his businesses? Is Ivanka going to? But it's not at all clear what these questions even mean, because their primary businesses are their names. You can't disentangle Trump the man from Trump the brand; those two entities merged long ago.\n\nThere's a whole web of ways the Trumps can make money off their names and their official and unofficial roles in the White House. Patronage at Trump hotels and resorts by foreign governments and corporations is probably the least of it. Here's an extract from another relevant chapter:\n\nThe conflicts tipped into self-parody on April 6, 2017, when, the Associated Press reported, \"Ivanka Trump's company won provisional approval from the Chinese government for three new trademarks, giving it monopoly rights to sell Ivanka brand jewelry, bags and spa services in the world's second-largest economy.\"\n\nBut that's not the only thing that happened that day. \"That night, the first daughter and her husband, Jared Kushner, sat next to the president of China and his wife for a steak and Dover sole dinner at Mar-a-Lago.\" A political summit whose details had been arranged by none other than Jared Kushner. This goes well beyond nepotism; it's the U.S. government as a for-profit family business.\n\nIvanka Trump and her husband White House senior adviser Jared Kushner attend a dinner with President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla., on April 6, 2017.\n\nAnd a new twist since the book went to press. In China, three labor activists were detained by the government in May while investigating conditions at factories that make shoes for Ivanka Trump's brand. This news came not long after the U.S.-based China Labor Watch alleged that some workers in factories that produced for Ivanka's brand were paid what amounted to less than a dollar an hour, while being forced to work 12.5-hour days, six days a week. Despite mounting international condemnation, the activists have yet to be released . Could it be that the Chinese government decided to provide the ultimate service to the Trump family of brands: silencing whistleblowers who were exposing ugly corporate truths?\n\nA New York Times reporter wrote earlier this month that, upon visiting Trump's golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey, she was given a (now-discontinued) brochure dangling the possibility of a treat from Trump himself: \"If he is on-site for your big day, he will likely stop in.\" Despite protestations to the contrary, the idea that Trump-the-man is still deeply involved in Trump-the-business is very much a part of the whole offer of Trump-branded hotels and clubs. And nowhere more so than at Mar-a-Lago:\n\nMar-a-Lago has already increased its membership fees, to $200,000 from $100,000. And why not? Now, for your fee, you might find yourself witnessing a high-stakes conversation about national security over dinner. You might get to hobnob with a visiting head of state. You might even get to witness Trump announcing that he has just launched an air assault on a foreign country.\n\nAnd, of course, you might even get to meet the president himself, and have the chance to quietly influence him. (No public records are kept of who comes and goes from the club, so who knows?) For decades, Trump has been selling the allure of proximity to wealth and power - it is the meaning of his brand. But now he's able to offer, to his paying customers, the real deal.\n\nAnything that increases Donald Trump's visibility, and the perception of him as all-powerful, actively increases the value of the Trump brand, and therefore increases how much clients will pay to be associated with it - to slap it on their new condo development, say, or, on a smaller scale, to play on his golf courses or buy one of his ties.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump Organization has worked relentlessly to expand its global reach. And why not? The brand is more visible now than ever before, and customers are willing to pay. As the lawsuit states, Trump's \"high office gives the Trump brand greater prominence and exposure.\" And this is the heart of what we need to understand about how dangerous it is to have a president who is in the business of selling not any one particular product but his name:\n\nGiven that what the Trump sons - Eric and Donald Jr. - are selling is ephemeral (a name), a buyer could pay $6 million for it or could pay $60 million. Who's to judge what constitutes a fair market-value price? More worryingly, who's to say what services are being purchased when a private company pays millions to lease the Trump brand? Do they really think it's that valuable to their condo tower, or do they think that by throwing in an extra $5 million, they might be looked on more favorably in other dealings that require a friendly relationship with the White House? It's very difficult to see how any of this can be untangled. A brand is worth whatever buyers are willing to pay for it. That's always been the appeal of building a business on this model - that something as ephemeral as a name could be vested with such real-world monetary value.\n\nWhat's extraordinary about Donald Trump's presidency is that now we are all inside the Trump branded world, whether we want to be or not. We have all become extras in his for-profit reality TV show, which has expanded to swallow the most powerful government in the world.\n\nThe Trumps aren't going to stop coming up with new ways to cash in on the presidency anytime soon. Since I finished writing \"No Is Not Enough,\" they've announced yet another creative new way to turn the White House into a for-profit family business, which I wrote about last week.\n\nEnter American Idea, \"a new midscale brand\" hotel chain whose first properties will be in Mississippi, a red state where Trump won 18 percentage points more of the popular vote than Hillary Clinton. This is not just an attempt at crashing the Comfort Inn niche by wrapping it in stars and stripes. It's also the most vivid window yet into the myriad ways the Trump family is transforming the presidency into a for-profit family business, annihilating the line between government and their web of brands.\n\nIt turns out that while the Trump kids were on the campaign trail last year, they weren't just stumping for their father - they were conducting market research on ways to profit from Trump voters. The sons would return to Trump Tower and report on the quaint and old-timey tastes enjoyed in \"real America,\" as Eric Trump described it on \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nAs Donald Jr. put it, he realized \"there's something here, there's a market here that we've been missing our entire lives by focusing only on the high end.\" And there were more perks to tagging along on the campaign trail. They also met people who donated to the Trump campaign, and some of those very people are now the first partners for this new venture .\n\nSo let's unpack that a bit. In Trump's world, voters are future customers, campaign donors are future investors, and election results are a rich vein of consumer data.\n\nThe new lawsuit, though welcome, is only the first step of understanding the merger of the Trump Organization and the White House - with its almost infinite possibilities for corruption and influence peddling.\n\nNaomi Klein's new book, No Is Not Enough: Resisting Trump's Shock Politics and Winning the World We Need , will published by Haymarket Books on June 13. www.noisnotenough.org\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Ivanka Trump Wanted Dad to Pursue Every Unhinged Challenge to the Election as Possible\n\nTom Williams/Zuma\n\nIvanka Trump's piss poor relationship with the truth-one of the most enduring storylines of the Trump era-has once again come into focus after the New York Times got a glimpse of the former first daughter, a month after the November presidential election, privately telling a film crew that her father should \"continue to fight\" the election results \"until every legal remedy is exhausted.\"\n\nIn the same interview, Ivanka was also reportedly recorded questioning the \"sanctity of our elections\"-a more polished version of the same unhinged, baseless claims about a stolen election that flowed through the former president's inner circle.\n\nThe remarks, as they seem to always do , fly in the face of Ivanka's testimony before the January 6 committee investigating the attack on the US Capitol, during which she told investigators that she had accepted Bill Barr's assessment that no fraud had taken place during the election. They also contradict the narrative that she and her husband, Jared Kushner, knew that Dad was a loser before it became official, and eagerly absconded to Miami while Trump marinaded in increasingly desperate conspiracy theories.\n\nIvanka's coup-friendly remarks are now in the hands of the committee after it subpoenaed Alex Holder, the British filmmaker who had sought to create a \"legacy project\" for the Trump presidency. To that end, it does seem as though Holder successfully captured one prominent theme of the Trump White House: Ivanka's ruthless self-interest.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Jared and Ivanka Knew Trump Was a Loser. But Don't Believe This Rehab Job.\n\nPatrick Semansky/AP\n\nAs the congressional committee investigating the attack on the US Capitol prepares to kick off its primetime hearing, a curious report has emerged on the front pages of the New York Times. Taken at face value, it offers a behind-the-scenes look at how Jared and Ivanka dealt with Donald Trump's increasingly delusional claim that he had defeated Joe Biden and secured a second term.\n\n\"We're moving to Miami,\" Kushner told his wife from their $18,000-a-month mansion, deciding that they'd hit eject even if Trump refused to accept defeat. The Times goes on :\n\nNo matter how vociferously Mr. Trump claimed otherwise, neither Mr. Kushner nor Ivanka Trump believed then or later that the election had been stolen, according to people close to them. While the president spent the hours and days after the polls closed complaining about imagined fraud in battleground states and plotting a strategy to hold on to power, his daughter and son-in-law were already washing their hands of the Trump presidency.\n\nTheir decision to move on opened a vacuum around the president that was filled by conspiracy theorists like Rudolph W. Giuliani and Sidney Powell, who relayed to Mr. Trump farcically false stories of dead voters, stuffed ballot boxes, corrupted voting machines and foreign plots. Concluding that the president would not listen even to family members urging him to accept the results, Mr. Kushner told Mr. Trump that he would not be involved if Mr. Giuliani were in charge, according to people he confided in, effectively ceding the field to those who would try to overturn the election.\n\nI'm no investigative journalist. Far from it! But to believe this account, at least entirely, is to ignore one of the most persistent storylines of the Trump era. We've seen this play out time and time again: flattering stories, somehow leaked to the press, depicting Jared and Ivanka as the least-awful members of MAGA-world. It's hardly a coincidence that this latest one, which could help shield the couple from any accusation that they played a role in fomenting violence at the Capitol, is emerging just as the January 6 committee is presenting them as the hearings' star attraction .\n\nBut alright, let's assume that this account is true, that Jared and Ivanka, knowing that Dad was a loser before the race was officially called, decided to exit fast. It certainly wouldn't be a leap to read that they spent the final days of the Trump White House checked out and overwhelmingly focused on their own reputations. But opening Trump's orbit to clearly unhinged characters, and eventually, the January 6 insurrection, is incredibly damning on its own-and once again shreds the notion that Javanka quietly operated as some kind of moderating force against Donald Trump. That image was manufactured by Ivanka herself. But how on earth is the media still doing the couple's dirty laundry?\n\nI'll leave you with the only good reason to actually click on the Times report today: That Kushner, whose parents reportedly bribed his way into Harvard , turned to a James Patterson-led MasterClass to write his forthcoming book on Trump's legacy.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The January 6 Committee Just Asked to Speak With Ivanka Trump\n\nStefani Reynolds/Zuma\n\nIn a letter sent Thursday, the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol requested the voluntary cooperation of Ivanka Trump, a notable escalation in the panel's attempts to interview Donald Trump's closest allies and family members.\n\nThe committee cited reports that the former first daughter had pushed the then-president to intervene as his supporters stormed the Capitol. Some of those rioters chanted \"Hang Mike Pence\" after the vice president refused to comply with Trump's demand that he attempt to overturn the results of the election.\n\n\"The Select Committee wishes to discuss the part of the conversation you observed between President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence on the morning of January 6th,\" the letter released Thursday read. \"Similarly, the Select Committee would like to discuss any other conversations you may have witnessed or participated in regarding the President's plan to obstruct or impede the counting of electoral votes.\"\n\nThe letter echoes remarks from Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), who, in an interview last month, said that the committee had firsthand testimony claiming that Ivanka Trump had urged her father to instruct his supporters to leave the Capitol and end the violence.\n\n\"We know as [Donald Trump] was sitting there in the dining room, next to the Oval Office, members of his staff were pleading with him to go on television to tell people to stop,\" Cheney told ABC News, adding that the committee had been told \"that his daughter Ivanka went in at least twice to ask him to please stop this violence.\"\n\nThe letter on Thursday also revealed that the committee may possess information suggesting that Donald Trump's own White House counsel may have concluded that the actions Trump wanted Pence to take would have been unconstitutional or illegal. The request for Ivanka's testimony comes on the heels of the committee subpoenaing Rudy Giuliani, along with three other members of Trump's legal team, earlier this week over their roles in pushing false conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Ivanka Trump's lawyers had stated that she hasn't been part of the Trump Organization since 2017 and currently resides in Florida, arguing that the New York court shouldn't have jurisdiction over her.\n\nIvanka, along with Eric and Don Jr., will now be compelled to take the stand ahead of the main defendant himself, Donald Trump. The former president will appear on November 6, in the blockbuster trial that threatens to unravel his sprawling business empire.\n\nIvanka has wanted to move on from all this drama, explicitly announcing she won't be joining her father's 2024 campaign . In the \"billionaire bunker,\" she now calls home-a 300-acre gated community on an island near Miami called Indian Creek Village-Ivanka's friends have reportedly been supportive of her bid to write a new chapter. According to the New York Times , \"Ms. Trump now generally minds her own business and people close to her think it is time she is allowed to move on with her new life.\"\n\nStill, the Kardashian invite must have felt like a genuine turning point, as she was welcomed back into a cloistered elite circle that also included Jeff Bezos's partner Lauren Sanchez. \"So blessed to have hit the jackpot of friends!\" Kardashian gushed on an Instagram gallery post featuring Ivanka. But even in this bubble, there were pesky reminders of her father's alleged mob behavior. According to the Times , one photographer yelled at Ivanka on the way to Kim's party, asking if she was \"afraid to testify\" at the trial. She didn't answer.\n\nA post shared by Kim Kardashian (@kimkardashian)\n\nNo one, in my estimation, has chronicled Ivanka Trump's intricate theatrics more adeptly than my colleague Inae Oh. She has highlighted Ivanka's hypocrisy concerning women ; how the media often helps to launder Ivanka's image; and pointed out her \"piss poor\" relationship with the truth , especially when supporting her father's Big Lie. Inae even compiled a list of events that form \"one of the most enduring storylines of the Trump era,\" revolving around Ivanka's efforts to improve her public image, even as her father's administration descended into chaos: \"Things are going off the rails, but never fear-Ivanka is diligently working behind the scenes to be the least problematic member of the administration, details of which conveniently find their way to the media.\"\n\nWe'll closely follow Ivanka's high-wire act on the stand and provide updates.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Ivanka Trump Cannot Recall\n\nLev Radin/Sipa USA/AP\n\nIvanka Trump took the stand on Wednesday in her father's civil fraud trial, but to hear her tell it, she wasn't sure why. Trump was polite and relaxed, in stark contrast to her father-who took the stand on Monday, rambling and frequently devolving into emotional outbursts during his testimony -and brothers, whose testimony was often defensive. But as personable as her demeanor may have been, she displayed an astonishingly bad memory.\n\nIvanka Trump was originally named as a defendant in the fraud case , brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who has accused former president Donald Trump, his company, and his two adult sons of fraudulently inflating the values of his assets to get better terms from banks and insurance companies. A higher court removed Ivanka from the case in June, saying she had largely cut ties with the Trump Organization during the period in which the fraud occurred. She attempted to avoid testifying at all, claiming that she knew little about the business details at the heart of the case.\n\nIndeed, on the stand, Trump insisted she didn't remember the details of almost everything James' attorneys inquired about. Over and over, asked about a particular deal or relationship with this or that bank, she drew a blank, answering \"I don't recall\" at least two dozen times. When prompted with emails and letters she had written or that had been sent to her, or confronted with accounts from others about her involvement, Trump generally conceded to remembering only the most basic details.\n\nEven when Louis Solomon, an attorney with James' office who led Wednesday's questioning, showed her copies of the documents in question, Trump said her memory wasn't jogged. Incredibly, she claimed she couldn't recall how much money she'd received when her father sold his downtown Washington, DC, hotel in 2021- more than $4 million . She said she remembered only that she had been paid.\n\nTrump was, however, very firm in her insistence she had nothing to do with any of the Trump financial statements that the judge, Arthur Engoron, has deemed fraudulent. And her memory seemed much improved when her father's attorneys cross-examined her about some of the same deals that she'd struggled to recall just a few minutes earlier.\n\nTake the Doral golf course in Miami, for which the Trump Organization got favorable interest rates from Deutsche Bank via an executive whom Ivanka had introduced to her father-rates based in part on fraudulent statements of her father's financial status. Under questioning by the prosecutors, she said she didn't remember details any of the competing loan offers-and didn't even remember some of the offers-that she'd personally solicited from a slew of lenders. But upon friendly cross-examination, she lit up and spoke warmly about her father's hopes for the golf course.\n\n\"My father had a deep and nostalgic love for that property, telling me about going to that property with his own father,\" she said. \"He told me he took my mother there.\"\n\nIn contrast to her professed inability to remember how much she profited from the sale of Donald Trump's DC hotel, she remembered exactly how much the Old Post Office building (which was renovated to build the hotel) had been costing taxpayers annually ($7.5 million). She also spoke very positively of her father's relationships with Deutsche Bank executives-the defense focused heavily on how the banks that lent money to Trump based on fraudulent financial statements did, in the end, get all of their money back.\n\nBut Trump's claim that she couldn't remember any of the fine details also rendered her unable to push back on any of the dozens of documents introduced as evidence during her testimony. These included loan offers from lenders who hadn't seen the fraudulent statements and had offered interest rates nearly double what Deutsche Bank provided the Trump Organization. This goes to the heart of James' claim: that the company saved hundreds of millions of dollars in interest and insurance fees because companies believed he was wealthier-and thus less of a financial risk-than he really was.\n\nOutside of the courthouse, James, who watched the testimony from the front row, said that Ivanka Trump's amicable affect didn't change anything about the case. \"At the end of the day, this case is about fraudulent statements about the financial condition that she benefited from,\" James told reporters. \"Despite the fact that she was very, very nice, very friendly-facts basically demonstrate the truth.\"\n\nIvanka is James' final witness. Donald Trump's attorneys will begin arguing their side next week.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Documents Show Ivanka Trump Didn't Testify Accurately in Inauguration Scandal Case\n\nMother Jones; Olivier Douliery/Sipa/AP; Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post/Getty\n\nThe Trump family has trouble with depositions. In 2007 testimony, Donald Trump was repeatedly shown to be a liar. In February, Donald Trump Jr. was deposed in the Trump inauguration scandal lawsuit, and on several key points, under oath, he provided false testimony . A review of documents filed in that case and other material obtained by Mother Jones shows that Ivanka Trump also testified inaccurately during her deposition in this lawsuit.\n\nThe inauguration probe was launched last year by Karl Racine, the attorney general of Washington, DC. He has alleged that Trump's inauguration committee misused charitable funds to enrich the Trump family. As Racine put it , the lawsuit maintains \"that the Inaugural Committee, a nonprofit corporation, coordinated with the Trump family to grossly overpay for event space in the Trump International Hotel... The Committee also improperly used non-profit funds to throw a private party [at the Trump Hotel] for the Trump family costing several hundred thousand dollars.\" In short, the attorney general accused the Trump gang of major grifting, and he is seeking to recover the money paid to the Trump Hotel so those funds can be used for real charitable purposes.\n\nDuring a December 1 deposition-in which she swore to tell the truth-Ivanka Trump, the eldest daughter of Donald Trump who was an executive at the Trump Organization before becoming a White House adviser to her father, was asked if she had any \"involvement in the process of planning the inauguration.\" She replied, \"I really didn't have an involvement.\" Ivanka testified that if her \"opinion was solicited\" regarding an inauguration event, she \"would give feedback to my father or to anyone who asked my perspective or opinion.\" And that was as far as her participation went.\n\nBut this wasn't accurate, according to the documents, which indicate she was part of the decision-making for various aspects of the inauguration, including even the menus for events.\n\nOne email chain shows that Ivanka Trump was directly involved in the planning of at least one proposed event for the inauguration. On November 29, 2016, Rick Gates, then the deputy chairman of the Presidential Inauguration Committee (known as the PIC), emailed her the current schedule of inauguration events. He noted that Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a lead producer working with the PIC, \"is going to call you to discuss some additional ideas she has about some other events that we would like to see if you would be willing to do based on our meetings.\" Ivanka replied to Gates and Winston Wolkoff, \"Great. I am looping in my assistant Suzie who can coordinate a time for us to connect.\"\n\nA few days later, Winston Wolkoff sent a long \"Dear Ivanka and Jared\" email to Ivanka Trump and her husband. She thanked them for \"our meeting yesterday\" and presented them with a \"high-level summary\" of the inauguration plans \"for your review.\" This was a detailed report on the assorted events and themes being created for Trump's inauguration. The \"overarching strategic objective,\" she reported, was \"reinforcing\" the theme \"With the People: Making America Great.\" She laid out \"key\" messages, including \"Our greatest strength is our people\" and \"Americans deserve to be heard, and their government needs to listen.\" She noted that in their recent meeting, she and Ivanka Trump had discussed how to include Donald Trump's \"constituency\" in the events, and Winston Wolkoff referred to proposals for doing so. This included inviting \"families from all 50 states to attend official functions\" and provide them \"Airfare. Accommodations. Hair & makeup.\"\n\nIn this email, Winston Wolkoff also asked Ivanka to confirm that she would host a \"Women's Entrepreneurs Reception/Dinner\" as part of the inauguration. \"Please let me know who...you would like invited,\" she added. And she asked whether Ivanka Trump would prefer for the event to be hosted at the National Museum of African American History or the National Gallery of Art. Winston Wolkoff also attached to the email the communications strategy for the inauguration, the proposed event schedule, and a list of the \"100 most influential women in Business, Philanthropy, Fashion, Politics and Finance.\" She ended the note saying she would \"follow up\" with them \"at TT\"-a reference to Trump Tower.\n\nKushner replied the next day in a brief email to Winston Wolkoff and told her, \"Thanks, Stephanie - looks like it's going to be a special event! So glad you are involved!\" Ivanka Trump responded, too, later that day, with a more elaborate email, stating, \"As mentioned, my interest in hosting [the dinner or reception for women entrepreneurs] depends on the quality and theme of the event. \" She added, \"I would love to bring together an incredible group of female entrepreneurs and thought leaders and integrate young girls in the programing. If we can make it an impactful event, I would love to do it.\" She asked Winston Wolkoff to work with Abigail Klem and Rosemary Young, respectively the president and marketing head of Ivanka's company. \"It would be great to have a cross section of industry and also invite top female cabinet members and lawmakers,\" she wrote. Ivanka also volunteered to help Winston Wolkoff if she had any problems coordinating with Reince Priebus, whom Trump had picked to be his White House chief of staff, and Katie Walsh, his deputy: \"please let me know if you don't get the direction that you need from Reince and Katie and I will step in.\"\n\nThat same day, Klem emailed Winston Wolkoff to set up a time to discuss the Ivanka Trump event, and she cc'd Ivanka and Kushner. On December 6, Winston Wolkoff met with Ivanka and her business associates regarding the women's event to be hosted by Ivanka, according to Winston Wolkoff. In her book, Melania and Me: The Rise and Fall of My Friendship with the First Lady , which chronicles a host of internal problems within the PIC, Winston Wolkoff recalls that this meeting caused her to wonder \"why was the PIC planning an event for Ivanka at all ? And how had I gotten roped into it?\"After the meeting, Tom Barrack, the billionaire pal of Donald Trump who was chairing the PIC, texted her, \"We have so much to do for each of them,\" referring to Trump family members.\n\nThe gathering of women entrepreneurs was eventually scuttled, but Ivanka Trump remained involved in other components of the inauguration planning. In late December 2016-after news reports noted that Donald Trump could not draw big-name entertainment figures for his inauguration events- Matthew Hiltzik , a public relations consultant, sent her an email under the subject heading, \"Here is the point i was going to share earlier...\" He told her that the \"narrative surrounding inauguration is going awry.\" Referring to Mark Burnett, the television producer who had created The Apprentice and who was working on the inauguration, Hiltzik wrote, \"Mark B and i were talking and he specifically suggested/requested that i raise this issue with you and he and i discussed the situation. Basically - in order to better control the narrative, you should have stephanie [Winston Wolkoff] be front and center on this and there needs to be clear direction expressed publicly about what the inauguration plan IS (celebration of talent of lesser known but incredibly gifted Americans) as opposed ot [sic] being defined by what it is NOT (no - or few - hollywood and top mainstream musical talent). Always best to be defined by what you are, vs. what you are not.\"\n\nAs Winston Wolkoff wrote in her book, Hiltzik \"was warning Ivanka to distance herself from the bad inauguration press and pushing me to the top of Shit Mountain.\" Ivanka forwarded this email to Winston Wolkoff with a simple message: \"I agree.\"\n\nOther emails show that Ivanka did participate in discussions about the talent being recruited for the inauguration. On December 23, Jon Reynaga, a producer working on the event, emailed Gates and Sara Armstrong, a top PIC official, with a list of musical artists being booked for inauguration events. \"They are all somewhat known acts but non-are A-listers,\" he observed. (The roster included Fantasia, a female soul singer, Big and Rich, a country act, and Katharine McPhee, an American Idol runner-up.) Armstrong replied, \"Well I'm worried this gets into the lower level that Ivanka didn't want.\" Gates responded that Barrack had okayed this list, and he added, \"The entertainment is coming in at cost/expenses which is one of the most important points for DJT - he will like that.\"\n\nIn a December 16 text to Reynaga, Winston Wolkoff reported that Trump \"DID NOT APPROVE THE BEACH BOYS and he nor Ivanka want them.\" Asked about this during her deposition, Ivanka Trump said, \"I don't recall that. I love the Beach Boys.\"\n\nAccording to text messages between them, Ivanka Trump instructed Winston Wolkoff to make sure there would be \"tons\" of reporters at the celebratory candlelight dinner being held the evening before the inauguration and at the inauguration balls. When Winston Wolkoff told her that the communications team for the Trump transition was not sending out information on these events to all the media, Ivanka took action. She communicated with Sean Spicer and texted back to Winston Wolkoff, \"He is on it and will circle up with...you.\"\n\nOne PIC planning document noted that Ivanka had a say in the catering. Winston Wolkoff, it reported, \"needs to get menus approved by IT and DJT.\"\n\nIn her book, Winston Wolkoff recounts a mid-December meeting in Donald Trump's office during which she presented to him and Ivanka the plans for eighteen inauguration events. \"I grabbed my binder, went over to Donald's side of his desk, and sat with my knees on the floor...Ivanka hovered over me...[and] made comments and asked questions.\" (\"I want tanks and choppers. Make it look like North Korea,\" Donald Trump said.) Days later, Winston Wolkoff tells Mother Jones , she attended a meeting at Ivanka Trump's office at Trump Tower where she provided Ivanka and other family members \"a run-through of the entire inauguration,\" which included slides on events, the communications strategy, and its branding.\n\nDuring her deposition in the inauguration case, Ivanka Trump downplayed her relationship with Winston Wolkoff. She described Winston Wolkoff as \"a person I knew in New York who does events,\" adding, \"I didn't know Stephanie Winston that well. I just knew she was very good at planning. I just knew her in that capacity.\" Winston Wolkoff, she said, was no more than \"an acquaintance.\" But emails between her and Winston Wolkoff obtained by Mother Jones indicate that in previous years, Ivanka Trump and Winston Wolkoff had been friends. In 2012, Ivanka emailed Winston Wolkoff, \"Jared and I are having a few friends over for dinner next Monday night (Nov 12th) and would love to have you and David join us. It will be a very casual, small group and I promise good food and conversation. If not, let's catch up soon.\" In another email exchange, the two women texted about family matters when they set up a lunch date.\n\nIvanka Trump was instrumental in landing Winston Wolkoff a top spot at the PIC. Days after Trump was elected president, she emailed Barrack, \"Per our conversation, I want to connect you with Stephanie, cced. She would be great for you to speak with about the planning of the inauguration-as mentioned, i have no doubt she will be invaluable to you!\"\n\nBut Ivanka Trump may now have reason to distance herself not only from the messy inauguration scandal but also from Winston Wolkoff, who became something of an internal whistleblower. During the planning process, Winston Wolkoff raised an important matter within the PIC: whether the Trump Hotel was overcharging Trump's inauguration committee. (This matter is at the heart of Racine's lawsuit against the Trump Organization and the PIC.) The first cost estimates were high, and Ivanka Trump interceded to obtain a better rate. But Winston Wolkoff believed this new estimate-$700,000 for meeting and banquet rooms reserved for four days-was still twice the market rate. On December 17, 2016, she emailed Gates, Ivanka Trump, and others to express her concern. \"Please take into consideration,\" she warned, that the PIC's spending would eventually be audited and this deal with the Trump Hotel would \"become public knowledge.\" Winston Wolkoff is now a lead cooperating witness in Racine's lawsuit against the Trump Organization and the PIC.\n\nMother Jones sent lawyers for Ivanka Trump and the Trump Organization a list of questions about her deposition testimony and its accuracy. They did not respond. Racine's office declined to comment on Ivanka Trump's deposition.\n\nIn her own deposition in the inauguration scandal case, Winston Wolkoff testified that she was worried \"it would look [that] members of the Trump family or the Trump Organization or the Trump Hotel financially profited from the inauguration.\" During that deposition, she was asked whether it seemed \"improper\" to her that Ivanka Trump was \"involved at times in decision-making about some of the events that were part of the inaugural festivities.\" She replied, \"I think it was questioned...It was out of the ordinary.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "NY Judges Force Donald and Ivanka Trump to Sit for Deposition in Civil Fraud Case\n\nAP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta, File\n\nA New York appellate court dealt Donald Trump another blow Thursday when it ruled that the former president and his daughter must sit for sworn depositions in the New York's civil fraud investigation into the family business. New York State Attorney General Letitia James subpoenaed Donald and Ivanka Trump back in December, but Trumps' attorneys argued that the they shouldn't have to because, they said, James' whole investigation was baseless and politically motivated. Arthur Engoron, the lower court judge handling the case, disagreed, writing in his decision that there was actually \"copious evidence\" that the Trumps might have committed fraud and no evidence that James' probe was motivated by an improper political bias.\n\nIn Thursday's ruling, four appellate judges from the New York Supreme Court's First Department agreed with Engoron's assessment, writing that the Trumps presented no evidence of politically motivated persecution or selective prosecution.\n\nDuring oral arguments back in February, the Trumps' attorneys seemed far more focused on appealing to public perception than on convincing Engoron. At one point, Alina Habba, Donald Trump's personal attorney in the case, complained that James refused to go after Trump's 2016 presidential rival.\n\n\"Are you going to go after Hillary Clinton for what she's doing to my client, that she spied at Trump Tower in your state?\" Habba demanded to know. \"Are you going to look into her business dealings?\"\n\nIn his own public statements, Trump has complained that James, who is Black, is one of several \"radical, vicious, racist prosecutors\" investigating him. In court, Habba claimed the investigation was about \"viewpoint discrimination,\" but the appellate judges were thoroughly unconvinced. To successfully make the argument that you are being illegally singled out for investigation, you have to show that someone else is not being investigated for a similar offense when they should be, and the judicial panel concluded-arguments about Hillary Clinton aside-that the Trumps \"have not identified any similarly implicated corporation that was not investigated or any executives of such a corporation who were not deposed.\"\n\nA representative for Trump did not return a request for comment on the appellate court's ruling.\n\nDespite the victory on Thursday, James may not get much out of the interviews. Donald and Ivanka Trump still have the right to refuse to answer questions if they might incriminate themselves by doing so. Last year, Eric Trump sat for a deposition with James' investigators and refused to answer more than 500 questions.\n\nThe appeal by Trump, and the subsequent rejection by a higher court, are part of a familiar pattern in James' inquiry, which has been going on for more than two years and has slowly but steadily moved closer to the former president. After initially cooperating with investigators in the early months of the investigation, Trump family attorneys have become increasingly combative but have had few if any victories in their efforts to stop James from probing further. Like the arguments made by Habba at the February hearing, most of Donald Trump's legal arguments have seemed to be fashioned to appeal to his own sense of outrage or intended primarily for public consumption.\n\nLast month, Donald Trump was held in contempt for refusing to turn over records that James subpoenaed in December, despite repeated rulings from Engoron that the Trumps must comply. Engoron eventually wound up fining Trump $10,000 per day until he cooperated. Trump ultimately racked up $110,000 in fines to be paid to James before he was able to convince Engoron that everything that should be turned over to James had been. The same appellate court that on Thursday rejected Trump's arguments about the deposition is also considering Trump's efforts to overturn the $10,000 fines. But last week, Trump forked over $110,000 to be held in an escrow account until that appeal is settled.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "This Story About Ivanka, Obama, and Poop Is So Much Worse Than You Could Imagine\n\nChris Kleponis/ZUMA\n\nThe brute stupidity and utter selfishness of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner have once again come into sharp focus. But nestled into the more familiar allegations of wasting tax-payer money in the latest report are the surprising appearances of former President Barack Obama and an \"unpleasant\" bathroom mess.\n\nThe Washington Post on Thursday revealed that Secret Service agents assigned to protect the home of Ivanka and Jared-a 5,000-square-foot mansion in the wealthy Kalorama neighborhood of Washington-were forbidden from using any of the couple's 6.5 bathrooms. The ban reportedly sent agents regularly scrambling in search of a reliable toilet, even forcing some to hit up colleagues stationed at the nearby garage of Barack Obama. But the plan came crashing down after an agent for the Trump-Kushner unit, during a fateful 2017 trip, left a giant, \"unpleasant mess\" that sparked yet another bathroom ban. From the Post :\n\nThe Obamas did not use the garage, so the extra traffic to and from the command post caused no problem. Yet this solution, too, was short-lived after a Secret Service supervisor from the Trump/Kushner detail left an unpleasant mess in the Obama bathroom at some point before the fall of 2017, according to a person briefed on the event. That prompted the leaders of the Obama detail to ban the agents up the street from ever returning.\n\nThe agents assigned to the president's daughter and son-in-law began driving a mile to Pence's home at the Naval Observatory, where they were allowed to use a bathroom in a stand-alone guard station.\n\nEventually, the Secret Service started renting a neighbor's basement studio so agents could relieve themselves. But the $3,000-a-month solution-more than $100,000 to date-comes at the expense of taxpayers, bringing this entire sordid tale back to Ivanka and Jared's long record of blowing through taxpayer money while like dad, treating Secret Service agents like complete shit.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Apparently, they were disgusted by Trump describing, in vivid anatomical detail, how he'd like to have sex with his adult daughter, Ivanka (who, by the way, worked in the White House with him, and some of them). Those details come from the upcoming book, Blowback: A Warning to Save Democracy from the Next Trump , by Miles Taylor, the former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security who wrote the anonymous 2018 New York Times op-ed, \"I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration.\" By the way, a lot of good that did Miles, given Trump's indictment on charges of espionage and role in fomenting the January 6 insurrection. Dude, I did more than you did to \"resist\" Trump. So did my dog Sadie. Taylor writes, \"Aides said he talked about Ivanka Trump 's breasts, her backside, and what it might be like to have sex with her, remarks that once led [former chief of staff] John Kelly to remind the president that Ivanka was his daughter.\" More From Joan Walsh A Trump Baby Boom?

Trump, he said, was 'a very, very evil man.'\" Kelly's mentee, Kirstjen Nielsen , who followed him as secretary of homeland security and supported (and some say promoted) his family separation policies, apparently whispered to Taylor, \"Trust me, this is not a healthy workplace for women.\" But those of us who have followed Trump's long career of political and financial corruption as well as his personal perversion weren't surprised at all to learn of his creepy incestuous hunger for his sad, complicit daughter. Trump told the shocked ladies of The View : \"If Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her.\" Maybe worst of all were his comments about his baby daughter , Tiffany, whom he compared to her mother, Marla Maples, elaborating: \"I think that she's got a lot of Marla, she's really a beautiful baby,\" Trump said. \"She's got Marla's legs. We don't know whether or not she's got this part yet but time will tell.\" He then held his tiny hands up to his chest to mime breasts.

And I helped create her. Ivanka. My daughter Ivanka. She's 6 feet tall, she's got the best body. She made a lot money as a model-a tremendous amount.\" -Trump said this on the Howard Stern radio show in 2003, Politico reported . 2) \"Ivanka is a great, great beauty. Every guy in the country wants to go out with my daughter. But she's got a boyfriend.\"- Trump said this in a 2004 New York Magazine profile . 3) \"I don't think Ivanka would do that inside [ Playboy ] magazine. Although she does have a very nice figure. I've said that if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her.\" 4) \"Yeah, she's really something, and what a beauty, that one. If I weren't happily married and, ya know, her father ...\" -Trump said this in a 2015 interview with Paul Solataroff for the September issue of Rolling Stone . So nobody-nobody-should have been shocked at what he said about Ivanka to White House staff. If you went to work for him, you knew that stuff. Oh I know, it's kinda graphic, maybe surprising he'd say it in public. But it shouldn't have been a shock. As for the supposed moral outrage of the Trump staffers who overheard him, I'm not going to say John Kelly is a \"very very evil man,\" as he referred to Trump. But he's pretty fucking bad. He propped up Trump and supported his worst excesses, especially when it came to immigrants. I'm sorry his morals were offended by Trump's incestuous perversion, but not by Trump's perverse treatment of immigrants, via policies he supported and helped craft. Meanwhile, Kirstjen Nielsen 's \"feminist\" stand on the workplace atmosphere: Wow, such a hero! Were the border camps you helped establish healthy for women or children, Kirstjen? She defended them, brazenly, in June 2018, partly denying that they existed, partly insisting that they were lawful, while earlier her agency admitted that it had separated nearly 2,000 children from adults over the course of six weeks at the southern US border. Last year, she joined the Swiss firm Astra Protocol as a \"strategic adviser,\" an alleged \"finance compliance\" company that looks like a great new vehicle for high-tech money laundering, alongside former Trump chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Kelly went right to work for the for-profit shelters taking advantage of the migrant families he'd separated. Miles Taylor is a contributor to MSNBC and writes well-compensated books. Donald Trump may go to prison. These people, who didn't speak out publicly, behind their own names, when they had the chance, are prospering and will continue to prosper. Ivanka will go on being the daughter of a man credibly accused of sexual assault, which she ignored, even as she ignored her own sexual mistreatment. She's a victim, in my opinion, but as some victims sadly do, she became a collaborator. I've been an advocate of a popular front when it comes to Donald Trump, welcoming the support of former political sparring partners like Tim Miller, Tom Nichols, Jennifer Rubin, Rick Wilson, Charlie Sykes, Mona Charen (and many more). But this book revulses me. If you care about the rights of women, in any fashion, you fought against Trump-you didn't go to work for him. None of these people can wash off the odor of \" Complicit \" now.\n\nThose details come from the upcoming book, Blowback: A Warning to Save Democracy from the Next Trump , by Miles Taylor, the former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security who wrote the anonymous 2018 New York Times op-ed, \"I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration.\" By the way, a lot of good that did Miles, given Trump's indictment on charges of espionage and role in fomenting the January 6 insurrection.

Trump Foundation. (AFP via Getty Images / Mandel Ngan)\n\nThis week, Donald Trump paid a total of $2 million to eight charities. Not because he wanted to, but because last month-in a lawsuit brought by New York's previous attorney general -a judge ruled that he had to pay this, as a penalty for using the Donald J. Trump Foundation as a personal piggy bank. Even more extraordinary, however, are the broader terms of the court settlement , which make it clear that the president and his three oldest children-who were all foundation officials-are con artists who can't be trusted with other people's dollars. If Trump ever wants to take part in charity work in New York State again, he will only be able to do so under special supervision. Attorney General Letitia James's office also announced that Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric Trump have been put through \"compulsory training to ensure this type of illegal activity never takes place again.\" Support our mission-driven journalism by purchasing a Nation 2020 full-color wall calendar . In normal times, a court ruling that the president is a grifter who can't be trusted to run his own charity would have gotten rather a lot of attention. But in a time of Noise-an attorney general deliberately misstating the findings of his own inspector general's report , the president tweeting insults at his own FBI director , yet another Nuremberg-styled Trump rally on Tuesday, and so on-the story got largely pushed to one side. Of course, while Trump and his family have been pillaging their own charitable foundation, this crooked and cruel administration is still going out of its way to demonize genuinely needy immigrants, who they claim have been scamming American taxpayers. Related Article Why Every Vote Matters-Now More Than Ever Sasha Abramsky This week, Trump's nativist team moved a whole lot closer to expanding the definition of who can be considered a \"public charge,\" a fundamental rewrite of American immigration policy according to their own awful vision. As I wrote in my previous column , a panel of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco overturned a national injunction against implementing the new rules, which would make it possible for immigrants to be deported for such offenses as using Medicaid or enrolling their families for food stamps. On Monday, another appeals court ruling -this one out of Richmond, Virginia's Fourth Circuit-overturned a second injunction. There's only one national injunction left against the public charge rule: the one issued in New York . That's a pretty slim thread from which to hang the hopes and dreams of many thousands of immigrants and their families. If the administration wins a ruling against that one in the Second Circuit, huge numbers of people using vital social services to keep their families sheltered, fed, and in good health will find themselves at risk of deportation. Others will feel forced to let their kids go hungry, stay sick, or even become homeless, in order to avoid using taxpayer-funded programs. And many, many more will be blocked from ever entering the United States in the first place. That's the Signal this holiday season.

Trump Foundation. (AFP via Getty Images / Mandel Ngan)\n\nThis week, Donald Trump paid a total of $2 million to eight charities. Not because he wanted to, but because last month-in a lawsuit brought by New York's previous attorney general -a judge ruled that he had to pay this, as a penalty for using the Donald J. Trump Foundation as a personal piggy bank. Even more extraordinary, however, are the broader terms of the court settlement , which make it clear that the president and his three oldest children-who were all foundation officials-are con artists who can't be trusted with other people's dollars. If Trump ever wants to take part in charity work in New York State again, he will only be able to do so under special supervision. Attorney General Letitia James's office also announced that Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric Trump have been put through \"compulsory training to ensure this type of illegal activity never takes place again.\" Support our mission-driven journalism by purchasing a Nation 2020 full-color wall calendar . In normal times, a court ruling that the president is a grifter who can't be trusted to run his own charity would have gotten rather a lot of attention. But in a time of Noise-an attorney general deliberately misstating the findings of his own inspector general's report , the president tweeting insults at his own FBI director , yet another Nuremberg-styled Trump rally on Tuesday, and so on-the story got largely pushed to one side. Of course, while Trump and his family have been pillaging their own charitable foundation, this crooked and cruel administration is still going out of its way to demonize genuinely needy immigrants, who they claim have been scamming American taxpayers.

She's just the wife of a senior White House adviser. Yet whenever Ivanka is her father's subject du jour, it's instructive. She's a litmus test on just how far the president will go to get his way on issues of very little importance to governing. Related Article What Can Ivanka Trump Possibly Do for Women Who Work? Amy Wilentz This week's presidential boil-over-concerning Nordstrom's decision to drop Ivanka's label-showed us that, even while the president is reportedly uninterested in anything but the simplest of policy discussions , he is more than eager to jump in when the issue touches family-and, more important, family money. The public's boycott of Ivanka's fashion line, Ivanka TrumpTM, may be the only thing about which Trump has ever felt remorse: His political success has become her business problem, if not yet her business failure. Hence his Wednesday tweet rebuking Nordstrom. And, possibly, hence Kellyanne Conway's Fox appearance a day later, hawking Ivanka's wares, while speaking from the White House. Nordstrom is not the only retailer that has dropped Ivanka's stuff, although it is the largest; as of today, only two Ivanka items are for sale on the Nordstrom website: two sad little pairs of shoes, flat black pumps (the pink ones are sold out), and red high-heeled ankle straps. They are steeply discounted. In a sense, Ivanka deserves it . She was already prepared at the GOP convention to use the political pulpit for personal promotion rather than policy. Though she made a nice speech, we discovered that the central lesson she learned from her presence there-and from her ensuing heightened popularity-was that being seen on a national stage could be lucrative. It turned out what we were witnessing that day was not the emergence of a new, young leader of the soft-right, as she was portrayed at that moment, but rather, quite simply, a model pimping a little pink dress. The next morning at 7:12 am Ivanka, having barely hung the dress up in her closet and moved on to a new Ivanka TrumpTM outfit, tweeted a link to the purchase page for the convention dress on the Macy's website (Macy's is still selling PDOTUS's line). For Ivanka, the convention stage was not a place to begin a political campaign but instead a platform to move forward with a business campaign. And Trump, too, sees his political ascendancy that way (although he does not wear a little pink dress). We've seen this in instances too numerous to mention, most notably his recent banning of travelers from seven Muslim nations, none of which are countries where his company has business interests. While the president is spewing and caviling and spurting all over Twitter about unimportant things like the terrible, unfair Nordstrom, people like Jeff Sessions, Tom Price (2:11 am confirmation), and others are taking over the reins of government.

Like Arnold Schwarzenegger in Sacramento but much more so, Trump in the White House is the very epitome of entertaining ourselves to death. We have a 24-hour reality show called the first family. We wave our little credit cards in protest and stop shopping at Nordstrom, only to enthusiastically swipe our credit cards there when the company drops her. So what is the political use of boycotting Ivanka Trump's line? Most boycotts are attempts to change unsavory policies, like land grabs by the British in Ireland, or the refusal to grant African Americans equal rights in the American South, or the poor pay and conditions of farm workers in the American West. The point here, I suppose, is to prevent money from flowing into the coffers of the Trump family, and to stop others, like Nordstrom, from profiting from Trump products. Expressing popular displeasure in this way seems to hurt the Trumps where they are most sensitive: in their pocketbooks (see Melania Trump's farcical suit against the Daily Mail , also filed last week). But even if every single store that sells Ivanka's brand should stop offering her line, what policy changes would be achieved? And where is the boycotters ' sacrifice in not buying at Nordstrom? That's the thing: To be powerful, a boycott ought to cause at least some discomfort on both sides-or at least they historically have done so. The original boycotts in Ireland in 1880 were hugely dangerous for all involved, as were the boycotts of the civil-rights movement. Even the legendary grape boycott on behalf of the farm workers entailed a sacrifice from citizen boycotters-no grapes. What kind of politics are we engaged in when a boycott means not using a credit card for unneeded purchases, and then afterwards, while crowing over victory, using a credit card for unneeded purchases? It's all so easy-like drone warfare. Is this the best use of our political time and energy? The end result of the Nordstrom affair was that Ivanka lost the contract, and in the two days after Trump posted his anti-Nordstrom tweet, the department store's stock price rose by almost 7 percent. In our excitement at our small victory over Ivanka Trump TM, we reacted by shopping, putting a new $115 million into the pockets of Nordstrom's two largest individual shareholders, both of them billionaire grandchildren of the chain's founder. There's something distasteful about shopping as a political statement. Yes, it's a rebuke to Trump that will offend him, but where does it lead a movement?'\n\nAmy Wilentz\n\nThis week's presidential boil-over-concerning Nordstrom's decision to drop Ivanka's label-showed us that, even while the president is reportedly uninterested in anything but the simplest of policy discussions , he is more than eager to jump in when the issue touches family-and, more important, family money.

Most boycotts are attempts to change unsavory policies, like land grabs by the British in Ireland, or the refusal to grant African Americans equal rights in the American South, or the poor pay and conditions of farm workers in the American West.

That's the thing: To be powerful, a boycott ought to cause at least some discomfort on both sides-or at least they historically have done so. The original boycotts in Ireland in 1880 were hugely dangerous for all involved, as were the boycotts of the civil-rights movement. Even the legendary grape boycott on behalf of the farm workers entailed a sacrifice from citizen boycotters-no grapes.

The end result of the Nordstrom affair was that Ivanka lost the contract, and in the two days after Trump posted his anti-Nordstrom tweet, the department store's stock price rose by almost 7 percent. In our excitement at our small victory over Ivanka Trump TM, we reacted by shopping, putting a new $115 million into the pockets of Nordstrom's two largest individual shareholders, both of them billionaire grandchildren of the chain's founder. There's something distasteful about shopping as a political statement. Yes, it's a rebuke to Trump that will offend him, but where does it lead a movement?'\n\nIn a sense, Ivanka deserves it . She was already prepared at the GOP convention to use the political pulpit for personal promotion rather than policy. Though she made a nice speech, we discovered that the central lesson she learned from her presence there-and from her ensuing heightened popularity-was that being seen on a national stage could be lucrative. It turned out what we were witnessing that day was not the emergence of a new, young leader of the soft-right, as she was portrayed at that moment, but rather, quite simply, a model pimping a little pink dress. The next morning at 7:12 am Ivanka, having barely hung the dress up in her closet and moved on to a new Ivanka TrumpTM outfit, tweeted a link to the purchase page for the convention dress on the Macy's website (Macy's is still selling PDOTUS's line).

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

She's just the wife of a senior White House adviser. Yet whenever Ivanka is her father's subject du jour, it's instructive. She's a litmus test on just how far the president will go to get his way on issues of very little importance to governing. Related Article What Can Ivanka Trump Possibly Do for Women Who Work? Amy Wilentz This week's presidential boil-over-concerning Nordstrom's decision to drop Ivanka's label-showed us that, even while the president is reportedly uninterested in anything but the simplest of policy discussions , he is more than eager to jump in when the issue touches family-and, more important, family money. The public's boycott of Ivanka's fashion line, Ivanka TrumpTM, may be the only thing about which Trump has ever felt remorse: His political success has become her business problem, if not yet her business failure. Hence his Wednesday tweet rebuking Nordstrom. And, possibly, hence Kellyanne Conway's Fox appearance a day later, hawking Ivanka's wares, while speaking from the White House. Nordstrom is not the only retailer that has dropped Ivanka's stuff, although it is the largest; as of today, only two Ivanka items are for sale on the Nordstrom website: two sad little pairs of shoes, flat black pumps (the pink ones are sold out), and red high-heeled ankle straps. They are steeply discounted. In a sense, Ivanka deserves it . She was already prepared at the GOP convention to use the political pulpit for personal promotion rather than policy.

Like Arnold Schwarzenegger in Sacramento but much more so, Trump in the White House is the very epitome of entertaining ourselves to death. We have a 24-hour reality show called the first family. We wave our little credit cards in protest and stop shopping at Nordstrom, only to enthusiastically swipe our credit cards there when the company drops her. So what is the political use of boycotting Ivanka Trump's line? Most boycotts are attempts to change unsavory policies, like land grabs by the British in Ireland, or the refusal to grant African Americans equal rights in the American South, or the poor pay and conditions of farm workers in the American West. The point here, I suppose, is to prevent money from flowing into the coffers of the Trump family, and to stop others, like Nordstrom, from profiting from Trump products. Expressing popular displeasure in this way seems to hurt the Trumps where they are most sensitive: in their pocketbooks (see Melania Trump's farcical suit against the Daily Mail , also filed last week). But even if every single store that sells Ivanka's brand should stop offering her line, what policy changes would be achieved? And where is the boycotters ' sacrifice in not buying at Nordstrom? That's the thing: To be powerful, a boycott ought to cause at least some discomfort on both sides-or at least they historically have done so. The original boycotts in Ireland in 1880 were hugely dangerous for all involved, as were the boycotts of the civil-rights movement. Even the legendary grape boycott on behalf of the farm workers entailed a sacrifice from citizen boycotters-no grapes. What kind of politics are we engaged in when a boycott means not using a credit card for unneeded purchases, and then afterwards, while crowing over victory, using a credit card for unneeded purchases? It's all so easy-like drone warfare. Is this the best use of our political time and energy? The end result of the Nordstrom affair was that Ivanka lost the contract, and in the two days after Trump posted his anti-Nordstrom tweet, the department store's stock price rose by almost 7 percent. In our excitement at our small victory over Ivanka Trump TM, we reacted by shopping, putting a new $115 million into the pockets of Nordstrom's two largest individual shareholders, both of them billionaire grandchildren of the chain's founder. There's something distasteful about shopping as a political statement. Yes, it's a rebuke to Trump that will offend him, but where does it lead a movement?'\n\nNordstrom is not the only retailer that has dropped Ivanka's stuff, although it is the largest; as of today, only two Ivanka items are for sale on the Nordstrom website: two sad little pairs of shoes, flat black pumps (the pink ones are sold out), and red high-heeled ankle straps. They are steeply discounted. In a sense, Ivanka deserves it . She was already prepared at the GOP convention to use the political pulpit for personal promotion rather than policy. Though she made a nice speech, we discovered that the central lesson she learned from her presence there-and from her ensuing heightened popularity-was that being seen on a national stage could be lucrative. It turned out what we were witnessing that day was not the emergence of a new, young leader of the soft-right, as she was portrayed at that moment, but rather, quite simply, a model pimping a little pink dress. The next morning at 7:12 am Ivanka, having barely hung the dress up in her closet and moved on to a new Ivanka TrumpTM outfit, tweeted a link to the purchase page for the convention dress on the Macy's website (Macy's is still selling PDOTUS's line). For Ivanka, the convention stage was not a place to begin a political campaign but instead a platform to move forward with a business campaign. And Trump, too, sees his political ascendancy that way (although he does not wear a little pink dress).

[T]here's just no way to measure the advantage I've gained from having the Trump name.... So rather than worrying about what other people think...my focus is to ensure that these successes continue for the next generation of Trumps. After all, we Trumps don't play to perceptions. We play to win. 1 Gosh, I sound like my father, don't I? But that's what you get from this particular Daddy's girl. 2 -Ivanka Trump, from The Trump Card: Playing to Win in Work and Life 3\n\nGosh, I sound like my father, don't I? But that's what you get from this particular Daddy's girl. 2 -Ivanka Trump, from The Trump Card: Playing to Win in Work and Life 3\n\n-Ivanka Trump, from The Trump Card: Playing to Win in Work and Life 3\n\nIvanka Trump is moving out of her Manhattan apartment to Washington, where, she has said, her biggest job will be to ease her three small children into their new lives, new schools, and new city. The rumor is that she will also serve as a surrogate first lady while Melania Trump stays in New York with her young son. Much as Michelle Obama was concerned with childhood obesity, Ivanka will pursue issues related to women and work, which also happens to be the subject of her forthcoming book, Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success . 4 No one forced Ivanka to uproot her life like this. She could have remained in New York and assumed the leadership of the Trump Organization along with her brothers Donald Jr. and Eric, while also continuing to work on her own clothing and accessories brand, IvankaTrump.com. Instead, she will leave both to follow her father. It's the kind of decision she has always made. After graduating from the Wharton School, as her father did, Ivanka decided to go into his business. She married another real-estate scion, a man who's the virtual double of her father, albeit with better hair. She joined the cast of The Apprentice , because her father ran that. Now, dutiful and unimaginative, Ivanka is following Donald to DC, which he also runs. Many presidential family members have ridden similar coattails throughout this nation's history, but not when attempting to embody the role of the independent working woman. 5 For three generations, the Trumps have been a family business. And, as is usual in a traditional family business, Ivanka's father will bring his son-in-law into the executive sphere rather than his daughter. Jared Kushner, now a senior White House adviser, is just the kind of man that Donald Trump can trust, respect, and rely on, because he's just like his father-in-law. Most important, Kushner is a man. In his official capacity, he'll be in charge of bringing peace to the Middle East, among more prosaic tasks like reaching out to the business community.

America's women. From her new house in Kalorama (no official office, no official desk), Ivanka will be unofficially consulting for her father while Dina Powell works as his new senior adviser on entrepreneurship, economic growth, and women's economic empowerment. Powell is a well-connected figure on the New York-Washington power axis who will be leaving her position at Goldman Sachs to join the administration. During the transition, she advised Ivanka. 7 Until now, Ivanka's main interest in women was in getting them to buy her handbags. Despite Powell's appointment, the Trump manipulation machine wants us to think that Ivanka is really his women's-rights representative. It also wants us to think that Ivanka, although a loyal tail-wagger for her father's right-wing train wreck, is somehow above it all-that she is forward-thinking (a former bestie of Chelsea Clinton! an art collector!), almost progressive, almost feminist, and profoundly not a forgotten woman... so not Rust Belt! But jobless and officeless in Washington, at home with the kids (supposedly), Ivanka looks more retro than progressive. In fact, she has hardly spoken a public word about any policy or program since her moderate speech at the Republican National Convention. There and ever since, her only job has been to burnish Trump's kinder, gentler side (if only he had one), to soften the Stephen Bannon blow, and to brand the new administration with a contemporary attitude toward women and women's rights, rather than the attitude of a pussy-grabbing sexual predator. 8 But (and here's the important thing): For all the talk of how Ivanka has her father's ear, on women's issues or any other... he doesn't listen to her . In interview after interview, she's been clear about how little interest Trump has in her opinion. \"Does he listen to you?\" one interviewer asked. \"Depends on the day,\" came her reply. 9 One day during the transition, for example, it was made to seem that Ivanka had a brief for climate change. She met with both Al Gore and the actor and environmental enthusiast Leonardo DiCaprio. But while Ivanka, and later her father, were chatting amicably with the former vice president, Trump's transition staff was putting together a list of well-known climate-change deniers and opponents of environmental regulation to populate his government. In any case, Ivanka has no record of interest in climate change, other than having co-hosted a single climate-friendly awards gala in New York in 2008. 10 Ivanka Trump looks on as My Father speaks at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, September 13, 2016. (Reuters /Mike Segar) Trump doesn't respect his daughter as a free agent and key adviser, a role that, of all the women around Trump, only former campaign manager Kellyanne Conway-now a White House counselor-seems to inhabit. Rather, Trump respects Ivanka because of her business acumen, learned from him; no doubt he respects her cojones, which are his cojones, and he probably appreciates her \"weaponized graciousness,\" as Emily Nussbaum termed it in The New Yorker . He also appreciates that her intelligence and ability and attractiveness and poise make him look good. Like any good narcissist, he respects her because she reflects him. In other words, Ivanka is a wholly owned subsidiary of \"My Father,\" as she almost religiously called him at the Republican convention. 11 * * * 12 Even the way in which Ivanka made her first stab at empowering women shows how far from progressive on these issues she and My Father really are. She didn't go state to state talking to women about what they need, or set up teams to do that; nor did she establish ties with representatives from women's groups around the country. (If she had, perhaps one of Trump's first executive orders would not have been to cut off funding to international groups that support abortion.) Instead, she asked the hyperconnected, super-ambitious socialite Wendi Deng, former wife of Rupert Murdoch, to host a power dinner at Deng's Fifth Avenue penthouse to discuss Ivanka's new brief. In attendance was Powell herself, still nominally with Goldman Sachs at the time; a number of corporate CEOs; the head of the Ford Foundation; Daily Beast founder Tina Brown; Nancy Gibbs, the editor of Time ; and the model Christy Turlington. Aside from being around the New York social circuit, Turlington had launched Every Mother Counts in 2011, a nonprofit that supports maternal health in the United States and which advocates internationally for safe birth practices. 13 This glitzy, high-profile branding of Ivanka's portfolio was intended to mask the fact that she's had little, or possibly no, experience dealing with the very difficult problems that lie ahead for women in America. Before the election, her main interest in women was getting them to buy her clothing, her handbags, and her shoes. Who can forget the ad that went up on the Internet the day after the convention to sell her little pale pink dress? \"Shop Ivanka's look from her #RNC speech,\" her brand tweeted the next day. 14 \"Everything you need is already inside you.\" -advice to working women from IvankaTrump.com Brand always wins out over substance with her (it's part of the business mentality), and when the substance is called into question, Ivanka retreats. For example, consider her pre-election interview with Cosmopolitan writer Prachi Gupta concerning the Trump campaign's proposal for maternity leave-a policy that Ivanka is supposed to have helped Conway develop to gain women's votes for My Father. The proposed leave gives government support to mothers for six weeks after their baby is born-if they can prove legal married status and don't have jobs that will already pay for it. Although the proposal's terms are unclear, it seems to exclude half of same-sex mothers (only a birth mother can receive the benefit), all unmarried mothers, all mothers of adopted infants, and certainly all fathers, whether in heterosexual or same-sex marriages. After questioning Ivanka about who the policy would leave out, Gupta cited My Father's 2004 statement that pregnancy was \"an inconvenience for a business\" and asked, \"Can you talk a little bit about those comments, and perhaps what has changed?\" 15 Ivanka's answer: \"So I think that you have a lot of negativity in these questions, and...I don't know how useful it is to spend too much time with you on this if you're going to make a comment like that.\" When Gupta defended the question-\"it is relevant a presidential candidate made those comments\"-Ivanka shot back, \"Well, you said he made those comments. I don't know that he said those comments,\" and ended the interview shortly thereafter. You can hear the echoes of My Father in those petulant and peremptory replies. 16 * * * 17 As a child, Ivanka was a total doll, an appendage and accessory for My Father. She was a golden, green-eyed, blond-haired thing, sweet-faced, alert, self-conscious, and, at 9 or 10 years old, already sexualized in a gold-lamé, lace-hemmed minidress, white pumps, gold jewelry, and a small, gold-chained gilt purse, her hair styled, her eyes watchful. In photos from the time, she always holds hands with My Father, more like a date than a daughter, while her mother Ivana trails them in the background (as Melania usually does today). 18 My Father could never keep his hands off Ivanka. In so many pictures of the two-as a child but especially as she begins to emerge into adulthood-Trump has his hands possessively on her waist or hips. Often, she's sitting coquettishly, Lolita-ishly, on his lap. In one much-viewed photograph, he's holding her there with his hands on her hips (she in a miniskirt, long legs aimed toward the camera), and she's cupping his chin as if he were her own dear love. To the side is a gilt statue of two large copulating birds. 19 Donald Trump with his daughter Ivanka at the Maybelline presents 1991 Look of the Year at Plaza Hotel in New York City, September 3, 1991. (Globe Photos/ZumaPress) Trump, of course, once told an interviewer that it would be OK to refer to his daughter as \"a piece of ass.\" In a later interview, he said: \"You know who's one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. My daughter, Ivanka. She's six feet tall. She's got the best body.\" When asked on The View whether Ivanka would ever pose for Playboy , Trump replied: \"I don't think Ivanka would do that inside the magazine. Although she does have a very nice figure. I've said that if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her.\" He can't stop talking about her body. 20 And yet, objectified as she certainly has been by this great big blustering objectifier of women, Ivanka has managed to pick up a lot of My Father's game. She's studied Trump and knows what he likes. He doesn't go for bookish girls, so when she went to Choate-one of the country's most exclusive prep schools-she also began working as a model (getting her first cover shoot, at age 15, for Seventeen ). After all, models and actresses are the women My Father marries. Then, after proving to him that she was marriageable, she went on to try to show that she could be him as well, by working at the Trump Organization. To be the Trump daughter, you must be a living contradiction in terms. You have to be a tough, rip-roaring negotiator and deal-closer like My Father, but you also have to be a sexy, leggy, fuckable babe who doesn't give much trouble. You have to be a Trump and a target for Trump. 21 In my hometown, the women who worked smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits. No matter how much Ivanka talks about what a great parent My Father was, Trump-more available to her than to any of his other children-was still not very present. He called a lot. And he took her calls; she brags about this. He provided special treats, vacations, presents. She certainly knew that to a large degree he held the reins of her inheritance. But My Father said flat out that he didn't like to care for children; men who change diapers, he's opined, are \"acting like the wife.\" The day-to-day rearing of Ivanka and her two brothers was done by four people: two Irish nannies and Ivana Trump's Czech parents, Milos and Maria. As Bill Maher once said about Trump's kids, they're like his real-estate projects: He doesn't build 'em, but he slaps his name on 'em. 22 What this set of paternal behaviors seems to have wrought in Ivanka's character is a woman who looks at herself and other women via the male gaze. She sees herself through My Father's eyes. Look at her: Of course she's pretty and young and has a great smile. But she's also ultrafeminized-a walking advertisement. She's beyond us, better than us, like a thoroughbred. She's a virtual Miss Universe runner-up, a created feminine figure-unreal, fixed, sculpted, and styled, done up and made up, invented as a female object. 23 * * * 24 Like any good Trump, Ivanka has erected an empire atop this act of self-creation, in her case at IvankaTrump.com, a retail-cum-inspirational website where \"Women Who Work\" is a prominent channel. The video that introduces \"Women Who Work\" is a multicultural collage of 25-to-35-year-old women who choose to work and are figuring out how to make their careers blend with starting a family and keeping the home together. Not one of the women pictured says, \"I don't want to have children,\" and not one is working at a typical industrial Rust Belt, lower-level office, or service-economy job-which is to say, the expected employment for most of the female American workforce. No one in this video says, \"I hate my boss.\" 25 Most of them seem to be their own bosses, or women who have started their own businesses. None of them are over 35, none are overweight; all are cisgendered. The Women Who Work are cookie- cutter, team-leader, go-getter gals, business-school graduates perhaps, all with good hair and makeup, nothing real or pained about them. There's no evidence that any of them have struggled. They all seem to be upper-middle-class, no matter their color or ethnic background. They're from a fantasy world in which every woman can get what she wants if only she works hard enough. 26 In another video, called \"Women Who Encourage,\" two reddish-haired women remove a clutch handbag from a gift box and then-one sitting and one standing, each in pink tops with black trousers, their coppery locks wafting-look tenderly at someone off to the right of the camera. This is how working women in Ivanka's virtual universe encourage each other: by offering things that are bought (preferably from IvankaTrump .com), rather than by leading a walkout at their place of employment, say, or by supporting one another when it comes to claims of sexual harassment. On Ivanka's website, conflict never exists. 27 IvankaTrump.com does have a section called \"Wise Words\" (\"Nothing is impossible. The word itself says 'I'm possible'\"-Audrey Hepburn; or \"It's never too late to be what you might have been,\" wrongly attributed to George Eliot; or \"Challenges are opportunities\"-so anodyne it's not attributed to anyone.) But you'll never read anything here about processing chickens or serving up burgers or sewing jeans, or what it's like to be a secretary, a receptionist, a nurse, a hairdresser, a teacher, a saleswoman, a waitress, a bookkeeper, a cashier, or any of the other jobs at which most American women work. 28 IvankaTrump.com prefers to address style and fashion, what you can buy for work and what you should wear to work, rather than the substance of work. It includes tips on how to get promoted and tips for thinking like a Harvard Business School graduate; it includes pages about yoga for the workday, as well as about entertaining and lifestyle and exercise and what to eat and what to serve. So far, wages, discrimination, and sexual harassment have not been on the radar, not even in a Lean In -lite kind of way. That's not the purpose of the website. It should be hashtagged #womenwhobuy. 29 This is what's known today as \"femvertising.\" The best thing one can say about Ivanka's retail celebration of women is that all of the women in her ads are portrayed as doing things for other women-the campaign is positively sapphic. Like all femvertising, IvankaTrump.com soft-pedals harsh realities; everything for working women comes wrapped in the gauze of love and encouragement and uplift and cool, calm niceness. Nothing on her site has to do with women's empowerment, because empowerment is political, and the politics of female empowerment must naturally take on the bastions of male power, which Ivanka isn't likely to do. Before the election, \"Women Who Work\" was part of her branding scheme, but now it's been retooled as a political scheme for her father's administration. The scheme should be beneficial both to the administration and to the brand, but not necessarily to women who actually work. 30 * * * 31 Anyway, silly me: I thought women who worked looked like Roseanne Barr, whose late-1980s sitcom embodied all the working women I knew growing up. Roseanne's eponymous character worked in a plastics factory, was often unemployed, took a fast-food job, was a telemarketer and later a bartender, and at some point-a low point-worked as a hair sweeper at a beauty salon. And, of course, she was a waitress. This is what life was like for the working women where I grew up, in sooty New Jersey, and also, apparently, in Barr's own Salt Lake City. (It turns out that the real Roseanne Barr, who ran for president in 2012, is now a slimmed-down, styled-up, face-fixed, and committed Hillary Clinton-hater-but I'm talking about the TV character, not the woman.) And if they didn't look like Roseanne, they were pert, exhausted office workers like Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Richards: put-upon, condescended to, and belittled by their boss and male co-workers. 32 In my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs. They didn't wear slim linen trousers and strappy heels and boxy pale cashmere V-necks to work, and they still don't. They wore stretch slacks and polyester blouses. They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?). And because so many women have to some degree internalized this oppressed version of self, Ivanka can seem like a role model. She is the working woman that the working women I knew in my youth may have dreamed they'd become when they first started to work. They thought perhaps they'd make enough money to have hair like that, teeth like that. Enough money, in other words, to be free of the grinding work they had to do just to get by. 36 * * * 37 So we gaze at the lovely Ivanka. How can we help it? She is an object of fascination. She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women. One of the things My Father has said about her illustrates precisely why Ivanka won't help women as a supposed presidential influencer. When asked, in the wake of the Roger Ailes scandal, how he'd feel if Ivanka were harassed at work, Trump replied that she would never allow that to happen: If a boss were foolish enough to bother her, she'd just go out and get a new job. 38 Because Ivanka Trump can do that. The rest of us can't. Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee of the 1970s-the one exceptional person who is hired and then used to prove that everything is fine for everyone else of their kind, when patently it is not. 39 Also, one has to remember the troupe of handmaids who make Ivanka's exceptional life possible. Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne? At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage. In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park. As she says, gesturing to the skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue and the whole sprawl of the green park: \"Not a bad view to wake up to.\" 42 Sometimes, women of this kind-pampered, raised to be unthinking and self-involved-can change and end up doing incredible things. But it's rare. And under the thumb of Donald Trump, as an extension of My Father, it's almost unimaginable. Women-so many of whom are underpaid, undervalued, disregarded, and abused-shouldn't think that they can put their fate into the hands of someone who, no matter how hard she's worked in her father's company, has no clue of what struggle really means. The fact that Ivanka is supposedly guiding women's policy shows just how little-not how much-My Father cares about it. 43 Editor's note : An earlier version of this article described Ivana Trump and her parents as Croatian. In fact, they are Czech. The text has been corrected. Listen to Amy Wilentz discuss Ivanka on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\nNo one forced Ivanka to uproot her life like this. She could have remained in New York and assumed the leadership of the Trump Organization along with her brothers Donald Jr. and Eric, while also continuing to work on her own clothing and accessories brand, IvankaTrump.com. Instead, she will leave both to follow her father. It's the kind of decision she has always made. After graduating from the Wharton School, as her father did, Ivanka decided to go into his business. She married another real-estate scion, a man who's the virtual double of her father, albeit with better hair. She joined the cast of The Apprentice , because her father ran that. Now, dutiful and unimaginative, Ivanka is following Donald to DC, which he also runs. Many presidential family members have ridden similar coattails throughout this nation's history, but not when attempting to embody the role of the independent working woman. 5 For three generations, the Trumps have been a family business. And, as is usual in a traditional family business, Ivanka's father will bring his son-in-law into the executive sphere rather than his daughter. Jared Kushner, now a senior White House adviser, is just the kind of man that Donald Trump can trust, respect, and rely on, because he's just like his father-in-law. Most important, Kushner is a man. In his official capacity, he'll be in charge of bringing peace to the Middle East, among more prosaic tasks like reaching out to the business community. Ivanka has no such official portfolio. 6 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols In other words, Trump has left Ivanka to take care of women's things, like her three little ones and possibly White House dinners, as well as...

In so many pictures of the two-as a child but especially as she begins to emerge into adulthood-Trump has his hands possessively on her waist or hips. Often, she's sitting coquettishly, Lolita-ishly, on his lap. In one much-viewed photograph, he's holding her there with his hands on her hips (she in a miniskirt, long legs aimed toward the camera), and she's cupping his chin as if he were her own dear love. To the side is a gilt statue of two large copulating birds. 19 Donald Trump with his daughter Ivanka at the Maybelline presents 1991 Look of the Year at Plaza Hotel in New York City, September 3, 1991. (Globe Photos/ZumaPress) Trump, of course, once told an interviewer that it would be OK to refer to his daughter as \"a piece of ass.\" In a later interview, he said: \"You know who's one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. My daughter, Ivanka. She's six feet tall. She's got the best body.\" When asked on The View whether Ivanka would ever pose for Playboy , Trump replied: \"I don't think Ivanka would do that inside the magazine. Although she does have a very nice figure. I've said that if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her.\" He can't stop talking about her body. 20 And yet, objectified as she certainly has been by this great big blustering objectifier of women, Ivanka has managed to pick up a lot of My Father's game. She's studied Trump and knows what he likes. He doesn't go for bookish girls, so when she went to Choate-one of the country's most exclusive prep schools-she also began working as a model (getting her first cover shoot, at age 15, for Seventeen ). After all, models and actresses are the women My Father marries. Then, after proving to him that she was marriageable, she went on to try to show that she could be him as well, by working at the Trump Organization. To be the Trump daughter, you must be a living contradiction in terms. You have to be a tough, rip-roaring negotiator and deal-closer like My Father, but you also have to be a sexy, leggy, fuckable babe who doesn't give much trouble. You have to be a Trump and a target for Trump. 21 In my hometown, the women who worked smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits. No matter how much Ivanka talks about what a great parent My Father was, Trump-more available to her than to any of his other children-was still not very present. He called a lot. And he took her calls; she brags about this. He provided special treats, vacations, presents. She certainly knew that to a large degree he held the reins of her inheritance. But My Father said flat out that he didn't like to care for children; men who change diapers, he's opined, are \"acting like the wife.\" The day-to-day rearing of Ivanka and her two brothers was done by four people: two Irish nannies and Ivana Trump's Czech parents, Milos and Maria. As Bill Maher once said about Trump's kids, they're like his real-estate projects: He doesn't build 'em, but he slaps his name on 'em. 22 What this set of paternal behaviors seems to have wrought in Ivanka's character is a woman who looks at herself and other women via the male gaze. She sees herself through My Father's eyes. Look at her: Of course she's pretty and young and has a great smile. But she's also ultrafeminized-a walking advertisement. She's beyond us, better than us, like a thoroughbred. She's a virtual Miss Universe runner-up, a created feminine figure-unreal, fixed, sculpted, and styled, done up and made up, invented as a female object. 23 * * * 24 Like any good Trump, Ivanka has erected an empire atop this act of self-creation, in her case at IvankaTrump.com, a retail-cum-inspirational website where \"Women Who Work\" is a prominent channel. The video that introduces \"Women Who Work\" is a multicultural collage of 25-to-35-year-old women who choose to work and are figuring out how to make their careers blend with starting a family and keeping the home together. Not one of the women pictured says, \"I don't want to have children,\" and not one is working at a typical industrial Rust Belt, lower-level office, or service-economy job-which is to say, the expected employment for most of the female American workforce. No one in this video says, \"I hate my boss.\" 25 Most of them seem to be their own bosses, or women who have started their own businesses. None of them are over 35, none are overweight; all are cisgendered. The Women Who Work are cookie- cutter, team-leader, go-getter gals, business-school graduates perhaps, all with good hair and makeup, nothing real or pained about them. There's no evidence that any of them have struggled. They all seem to be upper-middle-class, no matter their color or ethnic background. They're from a fantasy world in which every woman can get what she wants if only she works hard enough. 26 In another video, called \"Women Who Encourage,\" two reddish-haired women remove a clutch handbag from a gift box and then-one sitting and one standing, each in pink tops with black trousers, their coppery locks wafting-look tenderly at someone off to the right of the camera. This is how working women in Ivanka's virtual universe encourage each other: by offering things that are bought (preferably from IvankaTrump .com), rather than by leading a walkout at their place of employment, say, or by supporting one another when it comes to claims of sexual harassment. On Ivanka's website, conflict never exists. 27 IvankaTrump.com does have a section called \"Wise Words\" (\"Nothing is impossible. The word itself says 'I'm possible'\"-Audrey Hepburn; or \"It's never too late to be what you might have been,\" wrongly attributed to George Eliot; or \"Challenges are opportunities\"-so anodyne it's not attributed to anyone.) But you'll never read anything here about processing chickens or serving up burgers or sewing jeans, or what it's like to be a secretary, a receptionist, a nurse, a hairdresser, a teacher, a saleswoman, a waitress, a bookkeeper, a cashier, or any of the other jobs at which most American women work. 28 IvankaTrump.com prefers to address style and fashion, what you can buy for work and what you should wear to work, rather than the substance of work. It includes tips on how to get promoted and tips for thinking like a Harvard Business School graduate; it includes pages about yoga for the workday, as well as about entertaining and lifestyle and exercise and what to eat and what to serve. So far, wages, discrimination, and sexual harassment have not been on the radar, not even in a Lean In -lite kind of way. That's not the purpose of the website. It should be hashtagged #womenwhobuy. 29 This is what's known today as \"femvertising.\" The best thing one can say about Ivanka's retail celebration of women is that all of the women in her ads are portrayed as doing things for other women-the campaign is positively sapphic. Like all femvertising, IvankaTrump.com soft-pedals harsh realities; everything for working women comes wrapped in the gauze of love and encouragement and uplift and cool, calm niceness. Nothing on her site has to do with women's empowerment, because empowerment is political, and the politics of female empowerment must naturally take on the bastions of male power, which Ivanka isn't likely to do. Before the election, \"Women Who Work\" was part of her branding scheme, but now it's been retooled as a political scheme for her father's administration. The scheme should be beneficial both to the administration and to the brand, but not necessarily to women who actually work. 30 * * * 31 Anyway, silly me: I thought women who worked looked like Roseanne Barr, whose late-1980s sitcom embodied all the working women I knew growing up. Roseanne's eponymous character worked in a plastics factory, was often unemployed, took a fast-food job, was a telemarketer and later a bartender, and at some point-a low point-worked as a hair sweeper at a beauty salon. And, of course, she was a waitress. This is what life was like for the working women where I grew up, in sooty New Jersey, and also, apparently, in Barr's own Salt Lake City. (It turns out that the real Roseanne Barr, who ran for president in 2012, is now a slimmed-down, styled-up, face-fixed, and committed Hillary Clinton-hater-but I'm talking about the TV character, not the woman.) And if they didn't look like Roseanne, they were pert, exhausted office workers like Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Richards: put-upon, condescended to, and belittled by their boss and male co-workers. 32 In my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs. They didn't wear slim linen trousers and strappy heels and boxy pale cashmere V-necks to work, and they still don't. They wore stretch slacks and polyester blouses. They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?). And because so many women have to some degree internalized this oppressed version of self, Ivanka can seem like a role model. She is the working woman that the working women I knew in my youth may have dreamed they'd become when they first started to work. They thought perhaps they'd make enough money to have hair like that, teeth like that. Enough money, in other words, to be free of the grinding work they had to do just to get by. 36 * * * 37 So we gaze at the lovely Ivanka. How can we help it? She is an object of fascination. She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women. One of the things My Father has said about her illustrates precisely why Ivanka won't help women as a supposed presidential influencer. When asked, in the wake of the Roger Ailes scandal, how he'd feel if Ivanka were harassed at work, Trump replied that she would never allow that to happen: If a boss were foolish enough to bother her, she'd just go out and get a new job. 38 Because Ivanka Trump can do that. The rest of us can't. Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee of the 1970s-the one exceptional person who is hired and then used to prove that everything is fine for everyone else of their kind, when patently it is not. 39 Also, one has to remember the troupe of handmaids who make Ivanka's exceptional life possible. Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne? At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage. In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park. As she says, gesturing to the skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue and the whole sprawl of the green park: \"Not a bad view to wake up to.\" 42 Sometimes, women of this kind-pampered, raised to be unthinking and self-involved-can change and end up doing incredible things. But it's rare. And under the thumb of Donald Trump, as an extension of My Father, it's almost unimaginable. Women-so many of whom are underpaid, undervalued, disregarded, and abused-shouldn't think that they can put their fate into the hands of someone who, no matter how hard she's worked in her father's company, has no clue of what struggle really means. The fact that Ivanka is supposedly guiding women's policy shows just how little-not how much-My Father cares about it. 43 Editor's note : An earlier version of this article described Ivana Trump and her parents as Croatian. In fact, they are Czech. The text has been corrected. Listen to Amy Wilentz discuss Ivanka on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\nFor three generations, the Trumps have been a family business. And, as is usual in a traditional family business, Ivanka's father will bring his son-in-law into the executive sphere rather than his daughter. Jared Kushner, now a senior White House adviser, is just the kind of man that Donald Trump can trust, respect, and rely on, because he's just like his father-in-law. Most important, Kushner is a man. In his official capacity, he'll be in charge of bringing peace to the Middle East, among more prosaic tasks like reaching out to the business community. Ivanka has no such official portfolio. 6 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols In other words, Trump has left Ivanka to take care of women's things, like her three little ones and possibly White House dinners, as well as... America's women. From her new house in Kalorama (no official office, no official desk), Ivanka will be unofficially consulting for her father while Dina Powell works as his new senior adviser on entrepreneurship, economic growth, and women's economic empowerment. Powell is a well-connected figure on the New York-Washington power axis who will be leaving her position at Goldman Sachs to join the administration. During the transition, she advised Ivanka. 7 Until now, Ivanka's main interest in women was in getting them to buy her handbags. Despite Powell's appointment, the Trump manipulation machine wants us to think that Ivanka is really his women's-rights representative. It also wants us to think that Ivanka, although a loyal tail-wagger for her father's right-wing train wreck, is somehow above it all-that she is forward-thinking (a former bestie of Chelsea Clinton! an art collector!), almost progressive, almost feminist, and profoundly not a forgotten woman... so not Rust Belt! But jobless and officeless in Washington, at home with the kids (supposedly), Ivanka looks more retro than progressive. In fact, she has hardly spoken a public word about any policy or program since her moderate speech at the Republican National Convention. There and ever since, her only job has been to burnish Trump's kinder, gentler side (if only he had one), to soften the Stephen Bannon blow, and to brand the new administration with a contemporary attitude toward women and women's rights, rather than the attitude of a pussy-grabbing sexual predator. 8 But (and here's the important thing): For all the talk of how Ivanka has her father's ear, on women's issues or any other... he doesn't listen to her . In interview after interview, she's been clear about how little interest Trump has in her opinion. \"Does he listen to you?\" one interviewer asked. \"Depends on the day,\" came her reply. 9 One day during the transition, for example, it was made to seem that Ivanka had a brief for climate change. She met with both Al Gore and the actor and environmental enthusiast Leonardo DiCaprio. But while Ivanka, and later her father, were chatting amicably with the former vice president, Trump's transition staff was putting together a list of well-known climate-change deniers and opponents of environmental regulation to populate his government. In any case, Ivanka has no record of interest in climate change, other than having co-hosted a single climate-friendly awards gala in New York in 2008. 10 Ivanka Trump looks on as My Father speaks at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, September 13, 2016. (Reuters /Mike Segar) Trump doesn't respect his daughter as a free agent and key adviser, a role that, of all the women around Trump, only former campaign manager Kellyanne Conway-now a White House counselor-seems to inhabit. Rather, Trump respects Ivanka because of her business acumen, learned from him; no doubt he respects her cojones, which are his cojones, and he probably appreciates her \"weaponized graciousness,\" as Emily Nussbaum termed it in The New Yorker . He also appreciates that her intelligence and ability and attractiveness and poise make him look good. Like any good narcissist, he respects her because she reflects him. In other words, Ivanka is a wholly owned subsidiary of \"My Father,\" as she almost religiously called him at the Republican convention. 11 * * * 12 Even the way in which Ivanka made her first stab at empowering women shows how far from progressive on these issues she and My Father really are. She didn't go state to state talking to women about what they need, or set up teams to do that; nor did she establish ties with representatives from women's groups around the country. (If she had, perhaps one of Trump's first executive orders would not have been to cut off funding to international groups that support abortion.) Instead, she asked the hyperconnected, super-ambitious socialite Wendi Deng, former wife of Rupert Murdoch, to host a power dinner at Deng's Fifth Avenue penthouse to discuss Ivanka's new brief. In attendance was Powell herself, still nominally with Goldman Sachs at the time; a number of corporate CEOs; the head of the Ford Foundation; Daily Beast founder Tina Brown; Nancy Gibbs, the editor of Time ; and the model Christy Turlington. Aside from being around the New York social circuit, Turlington had launched Every Mother Counts in 2011, a nonprofit that supports maternal health in the United States and which advocates internationally for safe birth practices. 13 This glitzy, high-profile branding of Ivanka's portfolio was intended to mask the fact that she's had little, or possibly no, experience dealing with the very difficult problems that lie ahead for women in America. Before the election, her main interest in women was getting them to buy her clothing, her handbags, and her shoes. Who can forget the ad that went up on the Internet the day after the convention to sell her little pale pink dress? \"Shop Ivanka's look from her #RNC speech,\" her brand tweeted the next day. 14 \"Everything you need is already inside you.\" -advice to working women from IvankaTrump.com Brand always wins out over substance with her (it's part of the business mentality), and when the substance is called into question, Ivanka retreats. For example, consider her pre-election interview with Cosmopolitan writer Prachi Gupta concerning the Trump campaign's proposal for maternity leave-a policy that Ivanka is supposed to have helped Conway develop to gain women's votes for My Father. The proposed leave gives government support to mothers for six weeks after their baby is born-if they can prove legal married status and don't have jobs that will already pay for it. Although the proposal's terms are unclear, it seems to exclude half of same-sex mothers (only a birth mother can receive the benefit), all unmarried mothers, all mothers of adopted infants, and certainly all fathers, whether in heterosexual or same-sex marriages. After questioning Ivanka about who the policy would leave out, Gupta cited My Father's 2004 statement that pregnancy was \"an inconvenience for a business\" and asked, \"Can you talk a little bit about those comments, and perhaps what has changed?\" 15 Ivanka's answer: \"So I think that you have a lot of negativity in these questions, and...I don't know how useful it is to spend too much time with you on this if you're going to make a comment like that.\" When Gupta defended the question-\"it is relevant a presidential candidate made those comments\"-Ivanka shot back, \"Well, you said he made those comments. I don't know that he said those comments,\" and ended the interview shortly thereafter. You can hear the echoes of My Father in those petulant and peremptory replies. 16 * * * 17 As a child, Ivanka was a total doll, an appendage and accessory for My Father. She was a golden, green-eyed, blond-haired thing, sweet-faced, alert, self-conscious, and, at 9 or 10 years old, already sexualized in a gold-lamé, lace-hemmed minidress, white pumps, gold jewelry, and a small, gold-chained gilt purse, her hair styled, her eyes watchful.

And if they didn't look like Roseanne, they were pert, exhausted office workers like Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Richards: put-upon, condescended to, and belittled by their boss and male co-workers. 32 In my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs. They didn't wear slim linen trousers and strappy heels and boxy pale cashmere V-necks to work, and they still don't. They wore stretch slacks and polyester blouses. They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?). And because so many women have to some degree internalized this oppressed version of self, Ivanka can seem like a role model. She is the working woman that the working women I knew in my youth may have dreamed they'd become when they first started to work. They thought perhaps they'd make enough money to have hair like that, teeth like that. Enough money, in other words, to be free of the grinding work they had to do just to get by. 36 * * * 37 So we gaze at the lovely Ivanka. How can we help it? She is an object of fascination. She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women. One of the things My Father has said about her illustrates precisely why Ivanka won't help women as a supposed presidential influencer. When asked, in the wake of the Roger Ailes scandal, how he'd feel if Ivanka were harassed at work, Trump replied that she would never allow that to happen: If a boss were foolish enough to bother her, she'd just go out and get a new job. 38 Because Ivanka Trump can do that. The rest of us can't. Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee of the 1970s-the one exceptional person who is hired and then used to prove that everything is fine for everyone else of their kind, when patently it is not. 39 Also, one has to remember the troupe of handmaids who make Ivanka's exceptional life possible. Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne? At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage. In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park. As she says, gesturing to the skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue and the whole sprawl of the green park: \"Not a bad view to wake up to.\" 42 Sometimes, women of this kind-pampered, raised to be unthinking and self-involved-can change and end up doing incredible things. But it's rare. And under the thumb of Donald Trump, as an extension of My Father, it's almost unimaginable. Women-so many of whom are underpaid, undervalued, disregarded, and abused-shouldn't think that they can put their fate into the hands of someone who, no matter how hard she's worked in her father's company, has no clue of what struggle really means. The fact that Ivanka is supposedly guiding women's policy shows just how little-not how much-My Father cares about it. 43 Editor's note : An earlier version of this article described Ivana Trump and her parents as Croatian. In fact, they are Czech. The text has been corrected. Listen to Amy Wilentz discuss Ivanka on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\nJeet Heer\n\nElie Mystal\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nJeet Heer\n\nElie Mystal\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nIn other words, Trump has left Ivanka to take care of women's things, like her three little ones and possibly White House dinners, as well as... America's women. From her new house in Kalorama (no official office, no official desk), Ivanka will be unofficially consulting for her father while Dina Powell works as his new senior adviser on entrepreneurship, economic growth, and women's economic empowerment. Powell is a well-connected figure on the New York-Washington power axis who will be leaving her position at Goldman Sachs to join the administration. During the transition, she advised Ivanka. 7 Until now, Ivanka's main interest in women was in getting them to buy her handbags. Despite Powell's appointment, the Trump manipulation machine wants us to think that Ivanka is really his women's-rights representative. It also wants us to think that Ivanka, although a loyal tail-wagger for her father's right-wing train wreck, is somehow above it all-that she is forward-thinking (a former bestie of Chelsea Clinton! an art collector!), almost progressive, almost feminist, and profoundly not a forgotten woman... so not Rust Belt! But jobless and officeless in Washington, at home with the kids (supposedly), Ivanka looks more retro than progressive. In fact, she has hardly spoken a public word about any policy or program since her moderate speech at the Republican National Convention. There and ever since, her only job has been to burnish Trump's kinder, gentler side (if only he had one), to soften the Stephen Bannon blow, and to brand the new administration with a contemporary attitude toward women and women's rights, rather than the attitude of a pussy-grabbing sexual predator. 8 But (and here's the important thing): For all the talk of how Ivanka has her father's ear, on women's issues or any other... he doesn't listen to her . In interview after interview, she's been clear about how little interest Trump has in her opinion. \"Does he listen to you?\" one interviewer asked. \"Depends on the day,\" came her reply. 9 One day during the transition, for example, it was made to seem that Ivanka had a brief for climate change. She met with both Al Gore and the actor and environmental enthusiast Leonardo DiCaprio. But while Ivanka, and later her father, were chatting amicably with the former vice president, Trump's transition staff was putting together a list of well-known climate-change deniers and opponents of environmental regulation to populate his government. In any case, Ivanka has no record of interest in climate change, other than having co-hosted a single climate-friendly awards gala in New York in 2008. 10 Ivanka Trump looks on as My Father speaks at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, September 13, 2016. (Reuters /Mike Segar) Trump doesn't respect his daughter as a free agent and key adviser, a role that, of all the women around Trump, only former campaign manager Kellyanne Conway-now a White House counselor-seems to inhabit. Rather, Trump respects Ivanka because of her business acumen, learned from him; no doubt he respects her cojones, which are his cojones, and he probably appreciates her \"weaponized graciousness,\" as Emily Nussbaum termed it in The New Yorker . He also appreciates that her intelligence and ability and attractiveness and poise make him look good. Like any good narcissist, he respects her because she reflects him. In other words, Ivanka is a wholly owned subsidiary of \"My Father,\" as she almost religiously called him at the Republican convention. 11 * * * 12 Even the way in which Ivanka made her first stab at empowering women shows how far from progressive on these issues she and My Father really are. She didn't go state to state talking to women about what they need, or set up teams to do that; nor did she establish ties with representatives from women's groups around the country. (If she had, perhaps one of Trump's first executive orders would not have been to cut off funding to international groups that support abortion.) Instead, she asked the hyperconnected, super-ambitious socialite Wendi Deng, former wife of Rupert Murdoch, to host a power dinner at Deng's Fifth Avenue penthouse to discuss Ivanka's new brief. In attendance was Powell herself, still nominally with Goldman Sachs at the time; a number of corporate CEOs; the head of the Ford Foundation; Daily Beast founder Tina Brown; Nancy Gibbs, the editor of Time ; and the model Christy Turlington. Aside from being around the New York social circuit, Turlington had launched Every Mother Counts in 2011, a nonprofit that supports maternal health in the United States and which advocates internationally for safe birth practices. 13 This glitzy, high-profile branding of Ivanka's portfolio was intended to mask the fact that she's had little, or possibly no, experience dealing with the very difficult problems that lie ahead for women in America. Before the election, her main interest in women was getting them to buy her clothing, her handbags, and her shoes. Who can forget the ad that went up on the Internet the day after the convention to sell her little pale pink dress? \"Shop Ivanka's look from her #RNC speech,\" her brand tweeted the next day. 14 \"Everything you need is already inside you.\" -advice to working women from IvankaTrump.com Brand always wins out over substance with her (it's part of the business mentality), and when the substance is called into question, Ivanka retreats. For example, consider her pre-election interview with Cosmopolitan writer Prachi Gupta concerning the Trump campaign's proposal for maternity leave-a policy that Ivanka is supposed to have helped Conway develop to gain women's votes for My Father. The proposed leave gives government support to mothers for six weeks after their baby is born-if they can prove legal married status and don't have jobs that will already pay for it. Although the proposal's terms are unclear, it seems to exclude half of same-sex mothers (only a birth mother can receive the benefit), all unmarried mothers, all mothers of adopted infants, and certainly all fathers, whether in heterosexual or same-sex marriages. After questioning Ivanka about who the policy would leave out, Gupta cited My Father's 2004 statement that pregnancy was \"an inconvenience for a business\" and asked, \"Can you talk a little bit about those comments, and perhaps what has changed?\" 15 Ivanka's answer: \"So I think that you have a lot of negativity in these questions, and...I don't know how useful it is to spend too much time with you on this if you're going to make a comment like that.\" When Gupta defended the question-\"it is relevant a presidential candidate made those comments\"-Ivanka shot back, \"Well, you said he made those comments. I don't know that he said those comments,\" and ended the interview shortly thereafter. You can hear the echoes of My Father in those petulant and peremptory replies. 16 * * * 17 As a child, Ivanka was a total doll, an appendage and accessory for My Father. She was a golden, green-eyed, blond-haired thing, sweet-faced, alert, self-conscious, and, at 9 or 10 years old, already sexualized in a gold-lamé, lace-hemmed minidress, white pumps, gold jewelry, and a small, gold-chained gilt purse, her hair styled, her eyes watchful. In photos from the time, she always holds hands with My Father, more like a date than a daughter, while her mother Ivana trails them in the background (as Melania usually does today). 18 My Father could never keep his hands off Ivanka. In so many pictures of the two-as a child but especially as she begins to emerge into adulthood-Trump has his hands possessively on her waist or hips. Often, she's sitting coquettishly, Lolita-ishly, on his lap. In one much-viewed photograph, he's holding her there with his hands on her hips (she in a miniskirt, long legs aimed toward the camera), and she's cupping his chin as if he were her own dear love. To the side is a gilt statue of two large copulating birds. 19 Donald Trump with his daughter Ivanka at the Maybelline presents 1991 Look of the Year at Plaza Hotel in New York City, September 3, 1991. (Globe Photos/ZumaPress) Trump, of course, once told an interviewer that it would be OK to refer to his daughter as \"a piece of ass.\" In a later interview, he said: \"You know who's one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. My daughter, Ivanka. She's six feet tall. She's got the best body.\" When asked on The View whether Ivanka would ever pose for Playboy , Trump replied: \"I don't think Ivanka would do that inside the magazine. Although she does have a very nice figure. I've said that if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her.\" He can't stop talking about her body. 20 And yet, objectified as she certainly has been by this great big blustering objectifier of women, Ivanka has managed to pick up a lot of My Father's game. She's studied Trump and knows what he likes. He doesn't go for bookish girls, so when she went to Choate-one of the country's most exclusive prep schools-she also began working as a model (getting her first cover shoot, at age 15, for Seventeen ). After all, models and actresses are the women My Father marries. Then, after proving to him that she was marriageable, she went on to try to show that she could be him as well, by working at the Trump Organization. To be the Trump daughter, you must be a living contradiction in terms. You have to be a tough, rip-roaring negotiator and deal-closer like My Father, but you also have to be a sexy, leggy, fuckable babe who doesn't give much trouble. You have to be a Trump and a target for Trump. 21 In my hometown, the women who worked smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits. No matter how much Ivanka talks about what a great parent My Father was, Trump-more available to her than to any of his other children-was still not very present. He called a lot. And he took her calls; she brags about this. He provided special treats, vacations, presents. She certainly knew that to a large degree he held the reins of her inheritance. But My Father said flat out that he didn't like to care for children; men who change diapers, he's opined, are \"acting like the wife.\" The day-to-day rearing of Ivanka and her two brothers was done by four people: two Irish nannies and Ivana Trump's Czech parents, Milos and Maria. As Bill Maher once said about Trump's kids, they're like his real-estate projects: He doesn't build 'em, but he slaps his name on 'em. 22 What this set of paternal behaviors seems to have wrought in Ivanka's character is a woman who looks at herself and other women via the male gaze. She sees herself through My Father's eyes. Look at her: Of course she's pretty and young and has a great smile. But she's also ultrafeminized-a walking advertisement. She's beyond us, better than us, like a thoroughbred. She's a virtual Miss Universe runner-up, a created feminine figure-unreal, fixed, sculpted, and styled, done up and made up, invented as a female object. 23 * * * 24 Like any good Trump, Ivanka has erected an empire atop this act of self-creation, in her case at IvankaTrump.com, a retail-cum-inspirational website where \"Women Who Work\" is a prominent channel. The video that introduces \"Women Who Work\" is a multicultural collage of 25-to-35-year-old women who choose to work and are figuring out how to make their careers blend with starting a family and keeping the home together. Not one of the women pictured says, \"I don't want to have children,\" and not one is working at a typical industrial Rust Belt, lower-level office, or service-economy job-which is to say, the expected employment for most of the female American workforce. No one in this video says, \"I hate my boss.\" 25 Most of them seem to be their own bosses, or women who have started their own businesses. None of them are over 35, none are overweight; all are cisgendered. The Women Who Work are cookie- cutter, team-leader, go-getter gals, business-school graduates perhaps, all with good hair and makeup, nothing real or pained about them. There's no evidence that any of them have struggled. They all seem to be upper-middle-class, no matter their color or ethnic background. They're from a fantasy world in which every woman can get what she wants if only she works hard enough. 26 In another video, called \"Women Who Encourage,\" two reddish-haired women remove a clutch handbag from a gift box and then-one sitting and one standing, each in pink tops with black trousers, their coppery locks wafting-look tenderly at someone off to the right of the camera. This is how working women in Ivanka's virtual universe encourage each other: by offering things that are bought (preferably from IvankaTrump .com), rather than by leading a walkout at their place of employment, say, or by supporting one another when it comes to claims of sexual harassment. On Ivanka's website, conflict never exists. 27 IvankaTrump.com does have a section called \"Wise Words\" (\"Nothing is impossible. The word itself says 'I'm possible'\"-Audrey Hepburn; or \"It's never too late to be what you might have been,\" wrongly attributed to George Eliot; or \"Challenges are opportunities\"-so anodyne it's not attributed to anyone.) But you'll never read anything here about processing chickens or serving up burgers or sewing jeans, or what it's like to be a secretary, a receptionist, a nurse, a hairdresser, a teacher, a saleswoman, a waitress, a bookkeeper, a cashier, or any of the other jobs at which most American women work. 28 IvankaTrump.com prefers to address style and fashion, what you can buy for work and what you should wear to work, rather than the substance of work. It includes tips on how to get promoted and tips for thinking like a Harvard Business School graduate; it includes pages about yoga for the workday, as well as about entertaining and lifestyle and exercise and what to eat and what to serve. So far, wages, discrimination, and sexual harassment have not been on the radar, not even in a Lean In -lite kind of way. That's not the purpose of the website. It should be hashtagged #womenwhobuy. 29 This is what's known today as \"femvertising.\" The best thing one can say about Ivanka's retail celebration of women is that all of the women in her ads are portrayed as doing things for other women-the campaign is positively sapphic. Like all femvertising, IvankaTrump.com soft-pedals harsh realities; everything for working women comes wrapped in the gauze of love and encouragement and uplift and cool, calm niceness. Nothing on her site has to do with women's empowerment, because empowerment is political, and the politics of female empowerment must naturally take on the bastions of male power, which Ivanka isn't likely to do. Before the election, \"Women Who Work\" was part of her branding scheme, but now it's been retooled as a political scheme for her father's administration. The scheme should be beneficial both to the administration and to the brand, but not necessarily to women who actually work. 30 * * * 31 Anyway, silly me: I thought women who worked looked like Roseanne Barr, whose late-1980s sitcom embodied all the working women I knew growing up. Roseanne's eponymous character worked in a plastics factory, was often unemployed, took a fast-food job, was a telemarketer and later a bartender, and at some point-a low point-worked as a hair sweeper at a beauty salon. And, of course, she was a waitress. This is what life was like for the working women where I grew up, in sooty New Jersey, and also, apparently, in Barr's own Salt Lake City. (It turns out that the real Roseanne Barr, who ran for president in 2012, is now a slimmed-down, styled-up, face-fixed, and committed Hillary Clinton-hater-but I'm talking about the TV character, not the woman.) And if they didn't look like Roseanne, they were pert, exhausted office workers like Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Richards: put-upon, condescended to, and belittled by their boss and male co-workers. 32 In my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs. They didn't wear slim linen trousers and strappy heels and boxy pale cashmere V-necks to work, and they still don't. They wore stretch slacks and polyester blouses. They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely.

Instead, she asked the hyperconnected, super-ambitious socialite Wendi Deng, former wife of Rupert Murdoch, to host a power dinner at Deng's Fifth Avenue penthouse to discuss Ivanka's new brief. In attendance was Powell herself, still nominally with Goldman Sachs at the time; a number of corporate CEOs; the head of the Ford Foundation; Daily Beast founder Tina Brown; Nancy Gibbs, the editor of Time ; and the model Christy Turlington. Aside from being around the New York social circuit, Turlington had launched Every Mother Counts in 2011, a nonprofit that supports maternal health in the United States and which advocates internationally for safe birth practices. 13 This glitzy, high-profile branding of Ivanka's portfolio was intended to mask the fact that she's had little, or possibly no, experience dealing with the very difficult problems that lie ahead for women in America. Before the election, her main interest in women was getting them to buy her clothing, her handbags, and her shoes. Who can forget the ad that went up on the Internet the day after the convention to sell her little pale pink dress? \"Shop Ivanka's look from her #RNC speech,\" her brand tweeted the next day. 14 \"Everything you need is already inside you.\" -advice to working women from IvankaTrump.com Brand always wins out over substance with her (it's part of the business mentality), and when the substance is called into question, Ivanka retreats. For example, consider her pre-election interview with Cosmopolitan writer Prachi Gupta concerning the Trump campaign's proposal for maternity leave-a policy that Ivanka is supposed to have helped Conway develop to gain women's votes for My Father. The proposed leave gives government support to mothers for six weeks after their baby is born-if they can prove legal married status and don't have jobs that will already pay for it. Although the proposal's terms are unclear, it seems to exclude half of same-sex mothers (only a birth mother can receive the benefit), all unmarried mothers, all mothers of adopted infants, and certainly all fathers, whether in heterosexual or same-sex marriages. After questioning Ivanka about who the policy would leave out, Gupta cited My Father's 2004 statement that pregnancy was \"an inconvenience for a business\" and asked, \"Can you talk a little bit about those comments, and perhaps what has changed?\" 15 Ivanka's answer: \"So I think that you have a lot of negativity in these questions, and...I don't know how useful it is to spend too much time with you on this if you're going to make a comment like that.\" When Gupta defended the question-\"it is relevant a presidential candidate made those comments\"-Ivanka shot back, \"Well, you said he made those comments. I don't know that he said those comments,\" and ended the interview shortly thereafter. You can hear the echoes of My Father in those petulant and peremptory replies. 16 * * * 17 As a child, Ivanka was a total doll, an appendage and accessory for My Father. She was a golden, green-eyed, blond-haired thing, sweet-faced, alert, self-conscious, and, at 9 or 10 years old, already sexualized in a gold-lamé, lace-hemmed minidress, white pumps, gold jewelry, and a small, gold-chained gilt purse, her hair styled, her eyes watchful. In photos from the time, she always holds hands with My Father, more like a date than a daughter, while her mother Ivana trails them in the background (as Melania usually does today). 18 My Father could never keep his hands off Ivanka. In so many pictures of the two-as a child but especially as she begins to emerge into adulthood-Trump has his hands possessively on her waist or hips. Often, she's sitting coquettishly, Lolita-ishly, on his lap. In one much-viewed photograph, he's holding her there with his hands on her hips (she in a miniskirt, long legs aimed toward the camera), and she's cupping his chin as if he were her own dear love. To the side is a gilt statue of two large copulating birds. 19 Donald Trump with his daughter Ivanka at the Maybelline presents 1991 Look of the Year at Plaza Hotel in New York City, September 3, 1991. (Globe Photos/ZumaPress) Trump, of course, once told an interviewer that it would be OK to refer to his daughter as \"a piece of ass.\" In a later interview, he said: \"You know who's one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. My daughter, Ivanka. She's six feet tall. She's got the best body.\" When asked on The View whether Ivanka would ever pose for Playboy , Trump replied: \"I don't think Ivanka would do that inside the magazine. Although she does have a very nice figure. I've said that if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her.\" He can't stop talking about her body. 20 And yet, objectified as she certainly has been by this great big blustering objectifier of women, Ivanka has managed to pick up a lot of My Father's game. She's studied Trump and knows what he likes. He doesn't go for bookish girls, so when she went to Choate-one of the country's most exclusive prep schools-she also began working as a model (getting her first cover shoot, at age 15, for Seventeen ). After all, models and actresses are the women My Father marries. Then, after proving to him that she was marriageable, she went on to try to show that she could be him as well, by working at the Trump Organization. To be the Trump daughter, you must be a living contradiction in terms. You have to be a tough, rip-roaring negotiator and deal-closer like My Father, but you also have to be a sexy, leggy, fuckable babe who doesn't give much trouble. You have to be a Trump and a target for Trump. 21 In my hometown, the women who worked smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits. No matter how much Ivanka talks about what a great parent My Father was, Trump-more available to her than to any of his other children-was still not very present. He called a lot. And he took her calls; she brags about this. He provided special treats, vacations, presents. She certainly knew that to a large degree he held the reins of her inheritance. But My Father said flat out that he didn't like to care for children; men who change diapers, he's opined, are \"acting like the wife.\" The day-to-day rearing of Ivanka and her two brothers was done by four people: two Irish nannies and Ivana Trump's Czech parents, Milos and Maria. As Bill Maher once said about Trump's kids, they're like his real-estate projects: He doesn't build 'em, but he slaps his name on 'em. 22 What this set of paternal behaviors seems to have wrought in Ivanka's character is a woman who looks at herself and other women via the male gaze. She sees herself through My Father's eyes. Look at her: Of course she's pretty and young and has a great smile. But she's also ultrafeminized-a walking advertisement. She's beyond us, better than us, like a thoroughbred. She's a virtual Miss Universe runner-up, a created feminine figure-unreal, fixed, sculpted, and styled, done up and made up, invented as a female object. 23 * * * 24 Like any good Trump, Ivanka has erected an empire atop this act of self-creation, in her case at IvankaTrump.com, a retail-cum-inspirational website where \"Women Who Work\" is a prominent channel. The video that introduces \"Women Who Work\" is a multicultural collage of 25-to-35-year-old women who choose to work and are figuring out how to make their careers blend with starting a family and keeping the home together. Not one of the women pictured says, \"I don't want to have children,\" and not one is working at a typical industrial Rust Belt, lower-level office, or service-economy job-which is to say, the expected employment for most of the female American workforce. No one in this video says, \"I hate my boss.\" 25 Most of them seem to be their own bosses, or women who have started their own businesses. None of them are over 35, none are overweight; all are cisgendered. The Women Who Work are cookie- cutter, team-leader, go-getter gals, business-school graduates perhaps, all with good hair and makeup, nothing real or pained about them. There's no evidence that any of them have struggled. They all seem to be upper-middle-class, no matter their color or ethnic background. They're from a fantasy world in which every woman can get what she wants if only she works hard enough. 26 In another video, called \"Women Who Encourage,\" two reddish-haired women remove a clutch handbag from a gift box and then-one sitting and one standing, each in pink tops with black trousers, their coppery locks wafting-look tenderly at someone off to the right of the camera. This is how working women in Ivanka's virtual universe encourage each other: by offering things that are bought (preferably from IvankaTrump .com), rather than by leading a walkout at their place of employment, say, or by supporting one another when it comes to claims of sexual harassment. On Ivanka's website, conflict never exists. 27 IvankaTrump.com does have a section called \"Wise Words\" (\"Nothing is impossible. The word itself says 'I'm possible'\"-Audrey Hepburn; or \"It's never too late to be what you might have been,\" wrongly attributed to George Eliot; or \"Challenges are opportunities\"-so anodyne it's not attributed to anyone.) But you'll never read anything here about processing chickens or serving up burgers or sewing jeans, or what it's like to be a secretary, a receptionist, a nurse, a hairdresser, a teacher, a saleswoman, a waitress, a bookkeeper, a cashier, or any of the other jobs at which most American women work. 28 IvankaTrump.com prefers to address style and fashion, what you can buy for work and what you should wear to work, rather than the substance of work. It includes tips on how to get promoted and tips for thinking like a Harvard Business School graduate; it includes pages about yoga for the workday, as well as about entertaining and lifestyle and exercise and what to eat and what to serve. So far, wages, discrimination, and sexual harassment have not been on the radar, not even in a Lean In -lite kind of way. That's not the purpose of the website. It should be hashtagged #womenwhobuy. 29 This is what's known today as \"femvertising.\" The best thing one can say about Ivanka's retail celebration of women is that all of the women in her ads are portrayed as doing things for other women-the campaign is positively sapphic. Like all femvertising, IvankaTrump.com soft-pedals harsh realities; everything for working women comes wrapped in the gauze of love and encouragement and uplift and cool, calm niceness. Nothing on her site has to do with women's empowerment, because empowerment is political, and the politics of female empowerment must naturally take on the bastions of male power, which Ivanka isn't likely to do. Before the election, \"Women Who Work\" was part of her branding scheme, but now it's been retooled as a political scheme for her father's administration. The scheme should be beneficial both to the administration and to the brand, but not necessarily to women who actually work. 30 * * * 31 Anyway, silly me: I thought women who worked looked like Roseanne Barr, whose late-1980s sitcom embodied all the working women I knew growing up. Roseanne's eponymous character worked in a plastics factory, was often unemployed, took a fast-food job, was a telemarketer and later a bartender, and at some point-a low point-worked as a hair sweeper at a beauty salon. And, of course, she was a waitress. This is what life was like for the working women where I grew up, in sooty New Jersey, and also, apparently, in Barr's own Salt Lake City. (It turns out that the real Roseanne Barr, who ran for president in 2012, is now a slimmed-down, styled-up, face-fixed, and committed Hillary Clinton-hater-but I'm talking about the TV character, not the woman.) And if they didn't look like Roseanne, they were pert, exhausted office workers like Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Richards: put-upon, condescended to, and belittled by their boss and male co-workers. 32 In my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs. They didn't wear slim linen trousers and strappy heels and boxy pale cashmere V-necks to work, and they still don't. They wore stretch slacks and polyester blouses. They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?). And because so many women have to some degree internalized this oppressed version of self, Ivanka can seem like a role model. She is the working woman that the working women I knew in my youth may have dreamed they'd become when they first started to work. They thought perhaps they'd make enough money to have hair like that, teeth like that. Enough money, in other words, to be free of the grinding work they had to do just to get by. 36 * * * 37 So we gaze at the lovely Ivanka. How can we help it? She is an object of fascination. She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women. One of the things My Father has said about her illustrates precisely why Ivanka won't help women as a supposed presidential influencer. When asked, in the wake of the Roger Ailes scandal, how he'd feel if Ivanka were harassed at work, Trump replied that she would never allow that to happen: If a boss were foolish enough to bother her, she'd just go out and get a new job. 38 Because Ivanka Trump can do that. The rest of us can't. Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee of the 1970s-the one exceptional person who is hired and then used to prove that everything is fine for everyone else of their kind, when patently it is not. 39 Also, one has to remember the troupe of handmaids who make Ivanka's exceptional life possible. Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne? At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage. In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park. As she says, gesturing to the skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue and the whole sprawl of the green park: \"Not a bad view to wake up to.\" 42 Sometimes, women of this kind-pampered, raised to be unthinking and self-involved-can change and end up doing incredible things. But it's rare. And under the thumb of Donald Trump, as an extension of My Father, it's almost unimaginable. Women-so many of whom are underpaid, undervalued, disregarded, and abused-shouldn't think that they can put their fate into the hands of someone who, no matter how hard she's worked in her father's company, has no clue of what struggle really means. The fact that Ivanka is supposedly guiding women's policy shows just how little-not how much-My Father cares about it. 43 Editor's note : An earlier version of this article described Ivana Trump and her parents as Croatian. In fact, they are Czech. The text has been corrected. Listen to Amy Wilentz discuss Ivanka on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\nBut (and here's the important thing): For all the talk of how Ivanka has her father's ear, on women's issues or any other... he doesn't listen to her . In interview after interview, she's been clear about how little interest Trump has in her opinion. \"Does he listen to you?\" one interviewer asked. \"Depends on the day,\" came her reply. 9 One day during the transition, for example, it was made to seem that Ivanka had a brief for climate change. She met with both Al Gore and the actor and environmental enthusiast Leonardo DiCaprio. But while Ivanka, and later her father, were chatting amicably with the former vice president, Trump's transition staff was putting together a list of well-known climate-change deniers and opponents of environmental regulation to populate his government. In any case, Ivanka has no record of interest in climate change, other than having co-hosted a single climate-friendly awards gala in New York in 2008. 10 Ivanka Trump looks on as My Father speaks at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, September 13, 2016. (Reuters /Mike Segar) Trump doesn't respect his daughter as a free agent and key adviser, a role that, of all the women around Trump, only former campaign manager Kellyanne Conway-now a White House counselor-seems to inhabit. Rather, Trump respects Ivanka because of her business acumen, learned from him; no doubt he respects her cojones, which are his cojones, and he probably appreciates her \"weaponized graciousness,\" as Emily Nussbaum termed it in The New Yorker . He also appreciates that her intelligence and ability and attractiveness and poise make him look good. Like any good narcissist, he respects her because she reflects him. In other words, Ivanka is a wholly owned subsidiary of \"My Father,\" as she almost religiously called him at the Republican convention. 11 * * * 12 Even the way in which Ivanka made her first stab at empowering women shows how far from progressive on these issues she and My Father really are. She didn't go state to state talking to women about what they need, or set up teams to do that; nor did she establish ties with representatives from women's groups around the country. (If she had, perhaps one of Trump's first executive orders would not have been to cut off funding to international groups that support abortion.)

And if they didn't look like Roseanne, they were pert, exhausted office workers like Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Richards: put-upon, condescended to, and belittled by their boss and male co-workers. 32 In my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs. They didn't wear slim linen trousers and strappy heels and boxy pale cashmere V-necks to work, and they still don't. They wore stretch slacks and polyester blouses. They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?). And because so many women have to some degree internalized this oppressed version of self, Ivanka can seem like a role model. She is the working woman that the working women I knew in my youth may have dreamed they'd become when they first started to work. They thought perhaps they'd make enough money to have hair like that, teeth like that. Enough money, in other words, to be free of the grinding work they had to do just to get by. 36 * * * 37 So we gaze at the lovely Ivanka. How can we help it? She is an object of fascination. She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women. One of the things My Father has said about her illustrates precisely why Ivanka won't help women as a supposed presidential influencer. When asked, in the wake of the Roger Ailes scandal, how he'd feel if Ivanka were harassed at work, Trump replied that she would never allow that to happen: If a boss were foolish enough to bother her, she'd just go out and get a new job. 38 Because Ivanka Trump can do that. The rest of us can't. Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee of the 1970s-the one exceptional person who is hired and then used to prove that everything is fine for everyone else of their kind, when patently it is not. 39 Also, one has to remember the troupe of handmaids who make Ivanka's exceptional life possible. Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne? At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage. In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park. As she says, gesturing to the skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue and the whole sprawl of the green park: \"Not a bad view to wake up to.\" 42 Sometimes, women of this kind-pampered, raised to be unthinking and self-involved-can change and end up doing incredible things. But it's rare. And under the thumb of Donald Trump, as an extension of My Father, it's almost unimaginable. Women-so many of whom are underpaid, undervalued, disregarded, and abused-shouldn't think that they can put their fate into the hands of someone who, no matter how hard she's worked in her father's company, has no clue of what struggle really means. The fact that Ivanka is supposedly guiding women's policy shows just how little-not how much-My Father cares about it. 43 Editor's note : An earlier version of this article described Ivana Trump and her parents as Croatian. In fact, they are Czech. The text has been corrected. Listen to Amy Wilentz discuss Ivanka on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\nOne day during the transition, for example, it was made to seem that Ivanka had a brief for climate change. She met with both Al Gore and the actor and environmental enthusiast Leonardo DiCaprio. But while Ivanka, and later her father, were chatting amicably with the former vice president, Trump's transition staff was putting together a list of well-known climate-change deniers and opponents of environmental regulation to populate his government. In any case, Ivanka has no record of interest in climate change, other than having co-hosted a single climate-friendly awards gala in New York in 2008. 10 Ivanka Trump looks on as My Father speaks at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, September 13, 2016. (Reuters /Mike Segar) Trump doesn't respect his daughter as a free agent and key adviser, a role that, of all the women around Trump, only former campaign manager Kellyanne Conway-now a White House counselor-seems to inhabit. Rather, Trump respects Ivanka because of her business acumen, learned from him; no doubt he respects her cojones, which are his cojones, and he probably appreciates her \"weaponized graciousness,\" as Emily Nussbaum termed it in The New Yorker . He also appreciates that her intelligence and ability and attractiveness and poise make him look good. Like any good narcissist, he respects her because she reflects him. In other words, Ivanka is a wholly owned subsidiary of \"My Father,\" as she almost religiously called him at the Republican convention. 11 * * * 12 Even the way in which Ivanka made her first stab at empowering women shows how far from progressive on these issues she and My Father really are. She didn't go state to state talking to women about what they need, or set up teams to do that; nor did she establish ties with representatives from women's groups around the country. (If she had, perhaps one of Trump's first executive orders would not have been to cut off funding to international groups that support abortion.) Instead, she asked the hyperconnected, super-ambitious socialite Wendi Deng, former wife of Rupert Murdoch, to host a power dinner at Deng's Fifth Avenue penthouse to discuss Ivanka's new brief. In attendance was Powell herself, still nominally with Goldman Sachs at the time; a number of corporate CEOs; the head of the Ford Foundation; Daily Beast founder Tina Brown; Nancy Gibbs, the editor of Time ; and the model Christy Turlington. Aside from being around the New York social circuit, Turlington had launched Every Mother Counts in 2011, a nonprofit that supports maternal health in the United States and which advocates internationally for safe birth practices. 13 This glitzy, high-profile branding of Ivanka's portfolio was intended to mask the fact that she's had little, or possibly no, experience dealing with the very difficult problems that lie ahead for women in America. Before the election, her main interest in women was getting them to buy her clothing, her handbags, and her shoes. Who can forget the ad that went up on the Internet the day after the convention to sell her little pale pink dress? \"Shop Ivanka's look from her #RNC speech,\" her brand tweeted the next day. 14 \"Everything you need is already inside you.\" -advice to working women from IvankaTrump.com Brand always wins out over substance with her (it's part of the business mentality), and when the substance is called into question, Ivanka retreats. For example, consider her pre-election interview with Cosmopolitan writer Prachi Gupta concerning the Trump campaign's proposal for maternity leave-a policy that Ivanka is supposed to have helped Conway develop to gain women's votes for My Father. The proposed leave gives government support to mothers for six weeks after their baby is born-if they can prove legal married status and don't have jobs that will already pay for it. Although the proposal's terms are unclear, it seems to exclude half of same-sex mothers (only a birth mother can receive the benefit), all unmarried mothers, all mothers of adopted infants, and certainly all fathers, whether in heterosexual or same-sex marriages. After questioning Ivanka about who the policy would leave out, Gupta cited My Father's 2004 statement that pregnancy was \"an inconvenience for a business\" and asked, \"Can you talk a little bit about those comments, and perhaps what has changed?\" 15 Ivanka's answer: \"So I think that you have a lot of negativity in these questions, and...I don't know how useful it is to spend too much time with you on this if you're going to make a comment like that.\" When Gupta defended the question-\"it is relevant a presidential candidate made those comments\"-Ivanka shot back, \"Well, you said he made those comments. I don't know that he said those comments,\" and ended the interview shortly thereafter. You can hear the echoes of My Father in those petulant and peremptory replies. 16 * * * 17 As a child, Ivanka was a total doll, an appendage and accessory for My Father. She was a golden, green-eyed, blond-haired thing, sweet-faced, alert, self-conscious, and, at 9 or 10 years old, already sexualized in a gold-lamé, lace-hemmed minidress, white pumps, gold jewelry, and a small, gold-chained gilt purse, her hair styled, her eyes watchful. In photos from the time, she always holds hands with My Father, more like a date than a daughter, while her mother Ivana trails them in the background (as Melania usually does today). 18 My Father could never keep his hands off Ivanka. In so many pictures of the two-as a child but especially as she begins to emerge into adulthood-Trump has his hands possessively on her waist or hips. Often, she's sitting coquettishly, Lolita-ishly, on his lap. In one much-viewed photograph, he's holding her there with his hands on her hips (she in a miniskirt, long legs aimed toward the camera), and she's cupping his chin as if he were her own dear love. To the side is a gilt statue of two large copulating birds. 19 Donald Trump with his daughter Ivanka at the Maybelline presents 1991 Look of the Year at Plaza Hotel in New York City, September 3, 1991. (Globe Photos/ZumaPress) Trump, of course, once told an interviewer that it would be OK to refer to his daughter as \"a piece of ass.\" In a later interview, he said: \"You know who's one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. My daughter, Ivanka. She's six feet tall. She's got the best body.\" When asked on The View whether Ivanka would ever pose for Playboy , Trump replied: \"I don't think Ivanka would do that inside the magazine. Although she does have a very nice figure. I've said that if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her.\" He can't stop talking about her body. 20 And yet, objectified as she certainly has been by this great big blustering objectifier of women, Ivanka has managed to pick up a lot of My Father's game. She's studied Trump and knows what he likes. He doesn't go for bookish girls, so when she went to Choate-one of the country's most exclusive prep schools-she also began working as a model (getting her first cover shoot, at age 15, for Seventeen ). After all, models and actresses are the women My Father marries. Then, after proving to him that she was marriageable, she went on to try to show that she could be him as well, by working at the Trump Organization. To be the Trump daughter, you must be a living contradiction in terms. You have to be a tough, rip-roaring negotiator and deal-closer like My Father, but you also have to be a sexy, leggy, fuckable babe who doesn't give much trouble. You have to be a Trump and a target for Trump. 21 In my hometown, the women who worked smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits. No matter how much Ivanka talks about what a great parent My Father was, Trump-more available to her than to any of his other children-was still not very present. He called a lot. And he took her calls; she brags about this. He provided special treats, vacations, presents. She certainly knew that to a large degree he held the reins of her inheritance. But My Father said flat out that he didn't like to care for children; men who change diapers, he's opined, are \"acting like the wife.\" The day-to-day rearing of Ivanka and her two brothers was done by four people: two Irish nannies and Ivana Trump's Czech parents, Milos and Maria. As Bill Maher once said about Trump's kids, they're like his real-estate projects: He doesn't build 'em, but he slaps his name on 'em. 22 What this set of paternal behaviors seems to have wrought in Ivanka's character is a woman who looks at herself and other women via the male gaze. She sees herself through My Father's eyes. Look at her: Of course she's pretty and young and has a great smile. But she's also ultrafeminized-a walking advertisement. She's beyond us, better than us, like a thoroughbred. She's a virtual Miss Universe runner-up, a created feminine figure-unreal, fixed, sculpted, and styled, done up and made up, invented as a female object. 23 * * * 24 Like any good Trump, Ivanka has erected an empire atop this act of self-creation, in her case at IvankaTrump.com, a retail-cum-inspirational website where \"Women Who Work\" is a prominent channel. The video that introduces \"Women Who Work\" is a multicultural collage of 25-to-35-year-old women who choose to work and are figuring out how to make their careers blend with starting a family and keeping the home together. Not one of the women pictured says, \"I don't want to have children,\" and not one is working at a typical industrial Rust Belt, lower-level office, or service-economy job-which is to say, the expected employment for most of the female American workforce. No one in this video says, \"I hate my boss.\" 25 Most of them seem to be their own bosses, or women who have started their own businesses. None of them are over 35, none are overweight; all are cisgendered. The Women Who Work are cookie- cutter, team-leader, go-getter gals, business-school graduates perhaps, all with good hair and makeup, nothing real or pained about them. There's no evidence that any of them have struggled. They all seem to be upper-middle-class, no matter their color or ethnic background. They're from a fantasy world in which every woman can get what she wants if only she works hard enough. 26 In another video, called \"Women Who Encourage,\" two reddish-haired women remove a clutch handbag from a gift box and then-one sitting and one standing, each in pink tops with black trousers, their coppery locks wafting-look tenderly at someone off to the right of the camera. This is how working women in Ivanka's virtual universe encourage each other: by offering things that are bought (preferably from IvankaTrump .com), rather than by leading a walkout at their place of employment, say, or by supporting one another when it comes to claims of sexual harassment. On Ivanka's website, conflict never exists. 27 IvankaTrump.com does have a section called \"Wise Words\" (\"Nothing is impossible. The word itself says 'I'm possible'\"-Audrey Hepburn; or \"It's never too late to be what you might have been,\" wrongly attributed to George Eliot; or \"Challenges are opportunities\"-so anodyne it's not attributed to anyone.) But you'll never read anything here about processing chickens or serving up burgers or sewing jeans, or what it's like to be a secretary, a receptionist, a nurse, a hairdresser, a teacher, a saleswoman, a waitress, a bookkeeper, a cashier, or any of the other jobs at which most American women work. 28 IvankaTrump.com prefers to address style and fashion, what you can buy for work and what you should wear to work, rather than the substance of work. It includes tips on how to get promoted and tips for thinking like a Harvard Business School graduate; it includes pages about yoga for the workday, as well as about entertaining and lifestyle and exercise and what to eat and what to serve. So far, wages, discrimination, and sexual harassment have not been on the radar, not even in a Lean In -lite kind of way. That's not the purpose of the website. It should be hashtagged #womenwhobuy. 29 This is what's known today as \"femvertising.\" The best thing one can say about Ivanka's retail celebration of women is that all of the women in her ads are portrayed as doing things for other women-the campaign is positively sapphic. Like all femvertising, IvankaTrump.com soft-pedals harsh realities; everything for working women comes wrapped in the gauze of love and encouragement and uplift and cool, calm niceness. Nothing on her site has to do with women's empowerment, because empowerment is political, and the politics of female empowerment must naturally take on the bastions of male power, which Ivanka isn't likely to do. Before the election, \"Women Who Work\" was part of her branding scheme, but now it's been retooled as a political scheme for her father's administration. The scheme should be beneficial both to the administration and to the brand, but not necessarily to women who actually work. 30 * * * 31 Anyway, silly me: I thought women who worked looked like Roseanne Barr, whose late-1980s sitcom embodied all the working women I knew growing up. Roseanne's eponymous character worked in a plastics factory, was often unemployed, took a fast-food job, was a telemarketer and later a bartender, and at some point-a low point-worked as a hair sweeper at a beauty salon. And, of course, she was a waitress. This is what life was like for the working women where I grew up, in sooty New Jersey, and also, apparently, in Barr's own Salt Lake City. (It turns out that the real Roseanne Barr, who ran for president in 2012, is now a slimmed-down, styled-up, face-fixed, and committed Hillary Clinton-hater-but I'm talking about the TV character, not the woman.) And if they didn't look like Roseanne, they were pert, exhausted office workers like Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Richards: put-upon, condescended to, and belittled by their boss and male co-workers. 32 In my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs. They didn't wear slim linen trousers and strappy heels and boxy pale cashmere V-necks to work, and they still don't. They wore stretch slacks and polyester blouses. They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures.

(Globe Photos/ZumaPress) Trump, of course, once told an interviewer that it would be OK to refer to his daughter as \"a piece of ass.\" In a later interview, he said: \"You know who's one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. My daughter, Ivanka. She's six feet tall. She's got the best body.\" When asked on The View whether Ivanka would ever pose for Playboy , Trump replied: \"I don't think Ivanka would do that inside the magazine. Although she does have a very nice figure. I've said that if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her.\" He can't stop talking about her body. 20 And yet, objectified as she certainly has been by this great big blustering objectifier of women, Ivanka has managed to pick up a lot of My Father's game. She's studied Trump and knows what he likes. He doesn't go for bookish girls, so when she went to Choate-one of the country's most exclusive prep schools-she also began working as a model (getting her first cover shoot, at age 15, for Seventeen ). After all, models and actresses are the women My Father marries. Then, after proving to him that she was marriageable, she went on to try to show that she could be him as well, by working at the Trump Organization. To be the Trump daughter, you must be a living contradiction in terms. You have to be a tough, rip-roaring negotiator and deal-closer like My Father, but you also have to be a sexy, leggy, fuckable babe who doesn't give much trouble. You have to be a Trump and a target for Trump. 21 In my hometown, the women who worked smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits. No matter how much Ivanka talks about what a great parent My Father was, Trump-more available to her than to any of his other children-was still not very present. He called a lot. And he took her calls; she brags about this. He provided special treats, vacations, presents. She certainly knew that to a large degree he held the reins of her inheritance. But My Father said flat out that he didn't like to care for children; men who change diapers, he's opined, are \"acting like the wife.\" The day-to-day rearing of Ivanka and her two brothers was done by four people: two Irish nannies and Ivana Trump's Czech parents, Milos and Maria. As Bill Maher once said about Trump's kids, they're like his real-estate projects: He doesn't build 'em, but he slaps his name on 'em. 22 What this set of paternal behaviors seems to have wrought in Ivanka's character is a woman who looks at herself and other women via the male gaze. She sees herself through My Father's eyes. Look at her: Of course she's pretty and young and has a great smile. But she's also ultrafeminized-a walking advertisement. She's beyond us, better than us, like a thoroughbred. She's a virtual Miss Universe runner-up, a created feminine figure-unreal, fixed, sculpted, and styled, done up and made up, invented as a female object. 23 * * * 24 Like any good Trump, Ivanka has erected an empire atop this act of self-creation, in her case at IvankaTrump.com, a retail-cum-inspirational website where \"Women Who Work\" is a prominent channel. The video that introduces \"Women Who Work\" is a multicultural collage of 25-to-35-year-old women who choose to work and are figuring out how to make their careers blend with starting a family and keeping the home together. Not one of the women pictured says, \"I don't want to have children,\" and not one is working at a typical industrial Rust Belt, lower-level office, or service-economy job-which is to say, the expected employment for most of the female American workforce. No one in this video says, \"I hate my boss.\" 25 Most of them seem to be their own bosses, or women who have started their own businesses. None of them are over 35, none are overweight; all are cisgendered. The Women Who Work are cookie- cutter, team-leader, go-getter gals, business-school graduates perhaps, all with good hair and makeup, nothing real or pained about them. There's no evidence that any of them have struggled. They all seem to be upper-middle-class, no matter their color or ethnic background. They're from a fantasy world in which every woman can get what she wants if only she works hard enough. 26 In another video, called \"Women Who Encourage,\" two reddish-haired women remove a clutch handbag from a gift box and then-one sitting and one standing, each in pink tops with black trousers, their coppery locks wafting-look tenderly at someone off to the right of the camera. This is how working women in Ivanka's virtual universe encourage each other: by offering things that are bought (preferably from IvankaTrump .com), rather than by leading a walkout at their place of employment, say, or by supporting one another when it comes to claims of sexual harassment. On Ivanka's website, conflict never exists. 27 IvankaTrump.com does have a section called \"Wise Words\" (\"Nothing is impossible. The word itself says 'I'm possible'\"-Audrey Hepburn; or \"It's never too late to be what you might have been,\" wrongly attributed to George Eliot; or \"Challenges are opportunities\"-so anodyne it's not attributed to anyone.) But you'll never read anything here about processing chickens or serving up burgers or sewing jeans, or what it's like to be a secretary, a receptionist, a nurse, a hairdresser, a teacher, a saleswoman, a waitress, a bookkeeper, a cashier, or any of the other jobs at which most American women work. 28 IvankaTrump.com prefers to address style and fashion, what you can buy for work and what you should wear to work, rather than the substance of work. It includes tips on how to get promoted and tips for thinking like a Harvard Business School graduate; it includes pages about yoga for the workday, as well as about entertaining and lifestyle and exercise and what to eat and what to serve. So far, wages, discrimination, and sexual harassment have not been on the radar, not even in a Lean In -lite kind of way. That's not the purpose of the website. It should be hashtagged #womenwhobuy. 29 This is what's known today as \"femvertising.\" The best thing one can say about Ivanka's retail celebration of women is that all of the women in her ads are portrayed as doing things for other women-the campaign is positively sapphic. Like all femvertising, IvankaTrump.com soft-pedals harsh realities; everything for working women comes wrapped in the gauze of love and encouragement and uplift and cool, calm niceness. Nothing on her site has to do with women's empowerment, because empowerment is political, and the politics of female empowerment must naturally take on the bastions of male power, which Ivanka isn't likely to do. Before the election, \"Women Who Work\" was part of her branding scheme, but now it's been retooled as a political scheme for her father's administration. The scheme should be beneficial both to the administration and to the brand, but not necessarily to women who actually work. 30 * * * 31 Anyway, silly me: I thought women who worked looked like Roseanne Barr, whose late-1980s sitcom embodied all the working women I knew growing up. Roseanne's eponymous character worked in a plastics factory, was often unemployed, took a fast-food job, was a telemarketer and later a bartender, and at some point-a low point-worked as a hair sweeper at a beauty salon. And, of course, she was a waitress. This is what life was like for the working women where I grew up, in sooty New Jersey, and also, apparently, in Barr's own Salt Lake City. (It turns out that the real Roseanne Barr, who ran for president in 2012, is now a slimmed-down, styled-up, face-fixed, and committed Hillary Clinton-hater-but I'm talking about the TV character, not the woman.) And if they didn't look like Roseanne, they were pert, exhausted office workers like Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Richards: put-upon, condescended to, and belittled by their boss and male co-workers. 32 In my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs. They didn't wear slim linen trousers and strappy heels and boxy pale cashmere V-necks to work, and they still don't. They wore stretch slacks and polyester blouses. They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?). And because so many women have to some degree internalized this oppressed version of self, Ivanka can seem like a role model. She is the working woman that the working women I knew in my youth may have dreamed they'd become when they first started to work. They thought perhaps they'd make enough money to have hair like that, teeth like that. Enough money, in other words, to be free of the grinding work they had to do just to get by. 36 * * * 37 So we gaze at the lovely Ivanka. How can we help it? She is an object of fascination. She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women. One of the things My Father has said about her illustrates precisely why Ivanka won't help women as a supposed presidential influencer. When asked, in the wake of the Roger Ailes scandal, how he'd feel if Ivanka were harassed at work, Trump replied that she would never allow that to happen: If a boss were foolish enough to bother her, she'd just go out and get a new job. 38 Because Ivanka Trump can do that. The rest of us can't. Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee of the 1970s-the one exceptional person who is hired and then used to prove that everything is fine for everyone else of their kind, when patently it is not. 39 Also, one has to remember the troupe of handmaids who make Ivanka's exceptional life possible. Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne? At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage. In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park. As she says, gesturing to the skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue and the whole sprawl of the green park: \"Not a bad view to wake up to.\" 42 Sometimes, women of this kind-pampered, raised to be unthinking and self-involved-can change and end up doing incredible things. But it's rare. And under the thumb of Donald Trump, as an extension of My Father, it's almost unimaginable. Women-so many of whom are underpaid, undervalued, disregarded, and abused-shouldn't think that they can put their fate into the hands of someone who, no matter how hard she's worked in her father's company, has no clue of what struggle really means. The fact that Ivanka is supposedly guiding women's policy shows just how little-not how much-My Father cares about it. 43 Editor's note : An earlier version of this article described Ivana Trump and her parents as Croatian. In fact, they are Czech. The text has been corrected. Listen to Amy Wilentz discuss Ivanka on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\n* * * 12 Even the way in which Ivanka made her first stab at empowering women shows how far from progressive on these issues she and My Father really are. She didn't go state to state talking to women about what they need, or set up teams to do that; nor did she establish ties with representatives from women's groups around the country. (If she had, perhaps one of Trump's first executive orders would not have been to cut off funding to international groups that support abortion.) Instead, she asked the hyperconnected, super-ambitious socialite Wendi Deng, former wife of Rupert Murdoch, to host a power dinner at Deng's Fifth Avenue penthouse to discuss Ivanka's new brief. In attendance was Powell herself, still nominally with Goldman Sachs at the time; a number of corporate CEOs; the head of the Ford Foundation; Daily Beast founder Tina Brown; Nancy Gibbs, the editor of Time ; and the model Christy Turlington. Aside from being around the New York social circuit, Turlington had launched Every Mother Counts in 2011, a nonprofit that supports maternal health in the United States and which advocates internationally for safe birth practices. 13 This glitzy, high-profile branding of Ivanka's portfolio was intended to mask the fact that she's had little, or possibly no, experience dealing with the very difficult problems that lie ahead for women in America. Before the election, her main interest in women was getting them to buy her clothing, her handbags, and her shoes. Who can forget the ad that went up on the Internet the day after the convention to sell her little pale pink dress? \"Shop Ivanka's look from her #RNC speech,\" her brand tweeted the next day. 14 \"Everything you need is already inside you.\" -advice to working women from IvankaTrump.com Brand always wins out over substance with her (it's part of the business mentality), and when the substance is called into question, Ivanka retreats. For example, consider her pre-election interview with Cosmopolitan writer Prachi Gupta concerning the Trump campaign's proposal for maternity leave-a policy that Ivanka is supposed to have helped Conway develop to gain women's votes for My Father. The proposed leave gives government support to mothers for six weeks after their baby is born-if they can prove legal married status and don't have jobs that will already pay for it. Although the proposal's terms are unclear, it seems to exclude half of same-sex mothers (only a birth mother can receive the benefit), all unmarried mothers, all mothers of adopted infants, and certainly all fathers, whether in heterosexual or same-sex marriages. After questioning Ivanka about who the policy would leave out, Gupta cited My Father's 2004 statement that pregnancy was \"an inconvenience for a business\" and asked, \"Can you talk a little bit about those comments, and perhaps what has changed?\" 15 Ivanka's answer: \"So I think that you have a lot of negativity in these questions, and...I don't know how useful it is to spend too much time with you on this if you're going to make a comment like that.\" When Gupta defended the question-\"it is relevant a presidential candidate made those comments\"-Ivanka shot back, \"Well, you said he made those comments. I don't know that he said those comments,\" and ended the interview shortly thereafter. You can hear the echoes of My Father in those petulant and peremptory replies. 16 * * * 17 As a child, Ivanka was a total doll, an appendage and accessory for My Father. She was a golden, green-eyed, blond-haired thing, sweet-faced, alert, self-conscious, and, at 9 or 10 years old, already sexualized in a gold-lamé, lace-hemmed minidress, white pumps, gold jewelry, and a small, gold-chained gilt purse, her hair styled, her eyes watchful. In photos from the time, she always holds hands with My Father, more like a date than a daughter, while her mother Ivana trails them in the background (as Melania usually does today). 18 My Father could never keep his hands off Ivanka. In so many pictures of the two-as a child but especially as she begins to emerge into adulthood-Trump has his hands possessively on her waist or hips. Often, she's sitting coquettishly, Lolita-ishly, on his lap. In one much-viewed photograph, he's holding her there with his hands on her hips (she in a miniskirt, long legs aimed toward the camera), and she's cupping his chin as if he were her own dear love. To the side is a gilt statue of two large copulating birds. 19 Donald Trump with his daughter Ivanka at the Maybelline presents 1991 Look of the Year at Plaza Hotel in New York City, September 3, 1991. (Globe Photos/ZumaPress) Trump, of course, once told an interviewer that it would be OK to refer to his daughter as \"a piece of ass.\" In a later interview, he said: \"You know who's one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody?

In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park. As she says, gesturing to the skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue and the whole sprawl of the green park: \"Not a bad view to wake up to.\" 42 Sometimes, women of this kind-pampered, raised to be unthinking and self-involved-can change and end up doing incredible things. But it's rare. And under the thumb of Donald Trump, as an extension of My Father, it's almost unimaginable. Women-so many of whom are underpaid, undervalued, disregarded, and abused-shouldn't think that they can put their fate into the hands of someone who, no matter how hard she's worked in her father's company, has no clue of what struggle really means. The fact that Ivanka is supposedly guiding women's policy shows just how little-not how much-My Father cares about it. 43 Editor's note : An earlier version of this article described Ivana Trump and her parents as Croatian. In fact, they are Czech. The text has been corrected. Listen to Amy Wilentz discuss Ivanka on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\nEven the way in which Ivanka made her first stab at empowering women shows how far from progressive on these issues she and My Father really are. She didn't go state to state talking to women about what they need, or set up teams to do that; nor did she establish ties with representatives from women's groups around the country. (If she had, perhaps one of Trump's first executive orders would not have been to cut off funding to international groups that support abortion.) Instead, she asked the hyperconnected, super-ambitious socialite Wendi Deng, former wife of Rupert Murdoch, to host a power dinner at Deng's Fifth Avenue penthouse to discuss Ivanka's new brief. In attendance was Powell herself, still nominally with Goldman Sachs at the time; a number of corporate CEOs; the head of the Ford Foundation; Daily Beast founder Tina Brown; Nancy Gibbs, the editor of Time ; and the model Christy Turlington. Aside from being around the New York social circuit, Turlington had launched Every Mother Counts in 2011, a nonprofit that supports maternal health in the United States and which advocates internationally for safe birth practices. 13 This glitzy, high-profile branding of Ivanka's portfolio was intended to mask the fact that she's had little, or possibly no, experience dealing with the very difficult problems that lie ahead for women in America. Before the election, her main interest in women was getting them to buy her clothing, her handbags, and her shoes. Who can forget the ad that went up on the Internet the day after the convention to sell her little pale pink dress? \"Shop Ivanka's look from her #RNC speech,\" her brand tweeted the next day. 14 \"Everything you need is already inside you.\" -advice to working women from IvankaTrump.com Brand always wins out over substance with her (it's part of the business mentality), and when the substance is called into question, Ivanka retreats. For example, consider her pre-election interview with Cosmopolitan writer Prachi Gupta concerning the Trump campaign's proposal for maternity leave-a policy that Ivanka is supposed to have helped Conway develop to gain women's votes for My Father. The proposed leave gives government support to mothers for six weeks after their baby is born-if they can prove legal married status and don't have jobs that will already pay for it. Although the proposal's terms are unclear, it seems to exclude half of same-sex mothers (only a birth mother can receive the benefit), all unmarried mothers, all mothers of adopted infants, and certainly all fathers, whether in heterosexual or same-sex marriages. After questioning Ivanka about who the policy would leave out, Gupta cited My Father's 2004 statement that pregnancy was \"an inconvenience for a business\" and asked, \"Can you talk a little bit about those comments, and perhaps what has changed?\" 15 Ivanka's answer: \"So I think that you have a lot of negativity in these questions, and...I don't know how useful it is to spend too much time with you on this if you're going to make a comment like that.\" When Gupta defended the question-\"it is relevant a presidential candidate made those comments\"-Ivanka shot back, \"Well, you said he made those comments. I don't know that he said those comments,\" and ended the interview shortly thereafter. You can hear the echoes of My Father in those petulant and peremptory replies. 16 * * * 17 As a child, Ivanka was a total doll, an appendage and accessory for My Father. She was a golden, green-eyed, blond-haired thing, sweet-faced, alert, self-conscious, and, at 9 or 10 years old, already sexualized in a gold-lamé, lace-hemmed minidress, white pumps, gold jewelry, and a small, gold-chained gilt purse, her hair styled, her eyes watchful. In photos from the time, she always holds hands with My Father, more like a date than a daughter, while her mother Ivana trails them in the background (as Melania usually does today). 18 My Father could never keep his hands off Ivanka. In so many pictures of the two-as a child but especially as she begins to emerge into adulthood-Trump has his hands possessively on her waist or hips. Often, she's sitting coquettishly, Lolita-ishly, on his lap. In one much-viewed photograph, he's holding her there with his hands on her hips (she in a miniskirt, long legs aimed toward the camera), and she's cupping his chin as if he were her own dear love. To the side is a gilt statue of two large copulating birds. 19 Donald Trump with his daughter Ivanka at the Maybelline presents 1991 Look of the Year at Plaza Hotel in New York City, September 3, 1991. (Globe Photos/ZumaPress) Trump, of course, once told an interviewer that it would be OK to refer to his daughter as \"a piece of ass.\" In a later interview, he said: \"You know who's one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. My daughter, Ivanka. She's six feet tall. She's got the best body.\" When asked on The View whether Ivanka would ever pose for Playboy , Trump replied: \"I don't think Ivanka would do that inside the magazine. Although she does have a very nice figure. I've said that if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her.\" He can't stop talking about her body. 20 And yet, objectified as she certainly has been by this great big blustering objectifier of women, Ivanka has managed to pick up a lot of My Father's game. She's studied Trump and knows what he likes. He doesn't go for bookish girls, so when she went to Choate-one of the country's most exclusive prep schools-she also began working as a model (getting her first cover shoot, at age 15, for Seventeen ). After all, models and actresses are the women My Father marries. Then, after proving to him that she was marriageable, she went on to try to show that she could be him as well, by working at the Trump Organization. To be the Trump daughter, you must be a living contradiction in terms. You have to be a tough, rip-roaring negotiator and deal-closer like My Father, but you also have to be a sexy, leggy, fuckable babe who doesn't give much trouble. You have to be a Trump and a target for Trump. 21 In my hometown, the women who worked smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits. No matter how much Ivanka talks about what a great parent My Father was, Trump-more available to her than to any of his other children-was still not very present. He called a lot. And he took her calls; she brags about this. He provided special treats, vacations, presents. She certainly knew that to a large degree he held the reins of her inheritance. But My Father said flat out that he didn't like to care for children; men who change diapers, he's opined, are \"acting like the wife.\" The day-to-day rearing of Ivanka and her two brothers was done by four people: two Irish nannies and Ivana Trump's Czech parents, Milos and Maria. As Bill Maher once said about Trump's kids, they're like his real-estate projects: He doesn't build 'em, but he slaps his name on 'em. 22 What this set of paternal behaviors seems to have wrought in Ivanka's character is a woman who looks at herself and other women via the male gaze. She sees herself through My Father's eyes. Look at her: Of course she's pretty and young and has a great smile. But she's also ultrafeminized-a walking advertisement. She's beyond us, better than us, like a thoroughbred. She's a virtual Miss Universe runner-up, a created feminine figure-unreal, fixed, sculpted, and styled, done up and made up, invented as a female object. 23 * * * 24 Like any good Trump, Ivanka has erected an empire atop this act of self-creation, in her case at IvankaTrump.com, a retail-cum-inspirational website where \"Women Who Work\" is a prominent channel. The video that introduces \"Women Who Work\" is a multicultural collage of 25-to-35-year-old women who choose to work and are figuring out how to make their careers blend with starting a family and keeping the home together. Not one of the women pictured says, \"I don't want to have children,\" and not one is working at a typical industrial Rust Belt, lower-level office, or service-economy job-which is to say, the expected employment for most of the female American workforce. No one in this video says, \"I hate my boss.\" 25 Most of them seem to be their own bosses, or women who have started their own businesses. None of them are over 35, none are overweight; all are cisgendered. The Women Who Work are cookie- cutter, team-leader, go-getter gals, business-school graduates perhaps, all with good hair and makeup, nothing real or pained about them. There's no evidence that any of them have struggled. They all seem to be upper-middle-class, no matter their color or ethnic background. They're from a fantasy world in which every woman can get what she wants if only she works hard enough. 26 In another video, called \"Women Who Encourage,\" two reddish-haired women remove a clutch handbag from a gift box and then-one sitting and one standing, each in pink tops with black trousers, their coppery locks wafting-look tenderly at someone off to the right of the camera. This is how working women in Ivanka's virtual universe encourage each other: by offering things that are bought (preferably from IvankaTrump .com), rather than by leading a walkout at their place of employment, say, or by supporting one another when it comes to claims of sexual harassment. On Ivanka's website, conflict never exists. 27 IvankaTrump.com does have a section called \"Wise Words\" (\"Nothing is impossible. The word itself says 'I'm possible'\"-Audrey Hepburn; or \"It's never too late to be what you might have been,\" wrongly attributed to George Eliot; or \"Challenges are opportunities\"-so anodyne it's not attributed to anyone.) But you'll never read anything here about processing chickens or serving up burgers or sewing jeans, or what it's like to be a secretary, a receptionist, a nurse, a hairdresser, a teacher, a saleswoman, a waitress, a bookkeeper, a cashier, or any of the other jobs at which most American women work. 28 IvankaTrump.com prefers to address style and fashion, what you can buy for work and what you should wear to work, rather than the substance of work. It includes tips on how to get promoted and tips for thinking like a Harvard Business School graduate; it includes pages about yoga for the workday, as well as about entertaining and lifestyle and exercise and what to eat and what to serve. So far, wages, discrimination, and sexual harassment have not been on the radar, not even in a Lean In -lite kind of way. That's not the purpose of the website. It should be hashtagged #womenwhobuy. 29 This is what's known today as \"femvertising.\" The best thing one can say about Ivanka's retail celebration of women is that all of the women in her ads are portrayed as doing things for other women-the campaign is positively sapphic. Like all femvertising, IvankaTrump.com soft-pedals harsh realities; everything for working women comes wrapped in the gauze of love and encouragement and uplift and cool, calm niceness. Nothing on her site has to do with women's empowerment, because empowerment is political, and the politics of female empowerment must naturally take on the bastions of male power, which Ivanka isn't likely to do. Before the election, \"Women Who Work\" was part of her branding scheme, but now it's been retooled as a political scheme for her father's administration. The scheme should be beneficial both to the administration and to the brand, but not necessarily to women who actually work. 30 * * * 31 Anyway, silly me: I thought women who worked looked like Roseanne Barr, whose late-1980s sitcom embodied all the working women I knew growing up. Roseanne's eponymous character worked in a plastics factory, was often unemployed, took a fast-food job, was a telemarketer and later a bartender, and at some point-a low point-worked as a hair sweeper at a beauty salon. And, of course, she was a waitress. This is what life was like for the working women where I grew up, in sooty New Jersey, and also, apparently, in Barr's own Salt Lake City. (It turns out that the real Roseanne Barr, who ran for president in 2012, is now a slimmed-down, styled-up, face-fixed, and committed Hillary Clinton-hater-but I'm talking about the TV character, not the woman.) And if they didn't look like Roseanne, they were pert, exhausted office workers like Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Richards: put-upon, condescended to, and belittled by their boss and male co-workers. 32 In my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs. They didn't wear slim linen trousers and strappy heels and boxy pale cashmere V-necks to work, and they still don't. They wore stretch slacks and polyester blouses. They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?). And because so many women have to some degree internalized this oppressed version of self, Ivanka can seem like a role model. She is the working woman that the working women I knew in my youth may have dreamed they'd become when they first started to work. They thought perhaps they'd make enough money to have hair like that, teeth like that. Enough money, in other words, to be free of the grinding work they had to do just to get by. 36 * * * 37 So we gaze at the lovely Ivanka. How can we help it? She is an object of fascination. She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women. One of the things My Father has said about her illustrates precisely why Ivanka won't help women as a supposed presidential influencer. When asked, in the wake of the Roger Ailes scandal, how he'd feel if Ivanka were harassed at work, Trump replied that she would never allow that to happen: If a boss were foolish enough to bother her, she'd just go out and get a new job. 38 Because Ivanka Trump can do that. The rest of us can't. Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee of the 1970s-the one exceptional person who is hired and then used to prove that everything is fine for everyone else of their kind, when patently it is not. 39 Also, one has to remember the troupe of handmaids who make Ivanka's exceptional life possible. Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne? At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage.

They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?). And because so many women have to some degree internalized this oppressed version of self, Ivanka can seem like a role model. She is the working woman that the working women I knew in my youth may have dreamed they'd become when they first started to work. They thought perhaps they'd make enough money to have hair like that, teeth like that. Enough money, in other words, to be free of the grinding work they had to do just to get by. 36 * * * 37 So we gaze at the lovely Ivanka. How can we help it? She is an object of fascination. She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women. One of the things My Father has said about her illustrates precisely why Ivanka won't help women as a supposed presidential influencer. When asked, in the wake of the Roger Ailes scandal, how he'd feel if Ivanka were harassed at work, Trump replied that she would never allow that to happen: If a boss were foolish enough to bother her, she'd just go out and get a new job. 38 Because Ivanka Trump can do that. The rest of us can't. Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee of the 1970s-the one exceptional person who is hired and then used to prove that everything is fine for everyone else of their kind, when patently it is not. 39 Also, one has to remember the troupe of handmaids who make Ivanka's exceptional life possible. Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne? At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage. In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park. As she says, gesturing to the skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue and the whole sprawl of the green park: \"Not a bad view to wake up to.\" 42 Sometimes, women of this kind-pampered, raised to be unthinking and self-involved-can change and end up doing incredible things. But it's rare. And under the thumb of Donald Trump, as an extension of My Father, it's almost unimaginable. Women-so many of whom are underpaid, undervalued, disregarded, and abused-shouldn't think that they can put their fate into the hands of someone who, no matter how hard she's worked in her father's company, has no clue of what struggle really means. The fact that Ivanka is supposedly guiding women's policy shows just how little-not how much-My Father cares about it. 43 Editor's note : An earlier version of this article described Ivana Trump and her parents as Croatian. In fact, they are Czech. The text has been corrected. Listen to Amy Wilentz discuss Ivanka on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\n\"Everything you need is already inside you.\" -advice to working women from IvankaTrump.com\n\nBrand always wins out over substance with her (it's part of the business mentality), and when the substance is called into question, Ivanka retreats. For example, consider her pre-election interview with Cosmopolitan writer Prachi Gupta concerning the Trump campaign's proposal for maternity leave-a policy that Ivanka is supposed to have helped Conway develop to gain women's votes for My Father. The proposed leave gives government support to mothers for six weeks after their baby is born-if they can prove legal married status and don't have jobs that will already pay for it. Although the proposal's terms are unclear, it seems to exclude half of same-sex mothers (only a birth mother can receive the benefit), all unmarried mothers, all mothers of adopted infants, and certainly all fathers, whether in heterosexual or same-sex marriages. After questioning Ivanka about who the policy would leave out, Gupta cited My Father's 2004 statement that pregnancy was \"an inconvenience for a business\" and asked, \"Can you talk a little bit about those comments, and perhaps what has changed?\" 15 Ivanka's answer: \"So I think that you have a lot of negativity in these questions, and...I don't know how useful it is to spend too much time with you on this if you're going to make a comment like that.\" When Gupta defended the question-\"it is relevant a presidential candidate made those comments\"-Ivanka shot back, \"Well, you said he made those comments. I don't know that he said those comments,\" and ended the interview shortly thereafter. You can hear the echoes of My Father in those petulant and peremptory replies. 16 * * * 17 As a child, Ivanka was a total doll, an appendage and accessory for My Father. She was a golden, green-eyed, blond-haired thing, sweet-faced, alert, self-conscious, and, at 9 or 10 years old, already sexualized in a gold-lamé, lace-hemmed minidress, white pumps, gold jewelry, and a small, gold-chained gilt purse, her hair styled, her eyes watchful. In photos from the time, she always holds hands with My Father, more like a date than a daughter, while her mother Ivana trails them in the background (as Melania usually does today). 18 My Father could never keep his hands off Ivanka. In so many pictures of the two-as a child but especially as she begins to emerge into adulthood-Trump has his hands possessively on her waist or hips. Often, she's sitting coquettishly, Lolita-ishly, on his lap. In one much-viewed photograph, he's holding her there with his hands on her hips (she in a miniskirt, long legs aimed toward the camera), and she's cupping his chin as if he were her own dear love. To the side is a gilt statue of two large copulating birds. 19 Donald Trump with his daughter Ivanka at the Maybelline presents 1991 Look of the Year at Plaza Hotel in New York City, September 3, 1991. (Globe Photos/ZumaPress) Trump, of course, once told an interviewer that it would be OK to refer to his daughter as \"a piece of ass.\" In a later interview, he said: \"You know who's one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. My daughter, Ivanka. She's six feet tall. She's got the best body.\" When asked on The View whether Ivanka would ever pose for Playboy , Trump replied: \"I don't think Ivanka would do that inside the magazine. Although she does have a very nice figure. I've said that if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her.\" He can't stop talking about her body. 20 And yet, objectified as she certainly has been by this great big blustering objectifier of women, Ivanka has managed to pick up a lot of My Father's game. She's studied Trump and knows what he likes. He doesn't go for bookish girls, so when she went to Choate-one of the country's most exclusive prep schools-she also began working as a model (getting her first cover shoot, at age 15, for Seventeen ). After all, models and actresses are the women My Father marries. Then, after proving to him that she was marriageable, she went on to try to show that she could be him as well, by working at the Trump Organization. To be the Trump daughter, you must be a living contradiction in terms. You have to be a tough, rip-roaring negotiator and deal-closer like My Father, but you also have to be a sexy, leggy, fuckable babe who doesn't give much trouble. You have to be a Trump and a target for Trump. 21 In my hometown, the women who worked smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits. No matter how much Ivanka talks about what a great parent My Father was, Trump-more available to her than to any of his other children-was still not very present. He called a lot. And he took her calls; she brags about this. He provided special treats, vacations, presents. She certainly knew that to a large degree he held the reins of her inheritance. But My Father said flat out that he didn't like to care for children; men who change diapers, he's opined, are \"acting like the wife.\" The day-to-day rearing of Ivanka and her two brothers was done by four people: two Irish nannies and Ivana Trump's Czech parents, Milos and Maria. As Bill Maher once said about Trump's kids, they're like his real-estate projects: He doesn't build 'em, but he slaps his name on 'em. 22 What this set of paternal behaviors seems to have wrought in Ivanka's character is a woman who looks at herself and other women via the male gaze. She sees herself through My Father's eyes. Look at her: Of course she's pretty and young and has a great smile. But she's also ultrafeminized-a walking advertisement. She's beyond us, better than us, like a thoroughbred. She's a virtual Miss Universe runner-up, a created feminine figure-unreal, fixed, sculpted, and styled, done up and made up, invented as a female object. 23 * * * 24 Like any good Trump, Ivanka has erected an empire atop this act of self-creation, in her case at IvankaTrump.com, a retail-cum-inspirational website where \"Women Who Work\" is a prominent channel. The video that introduces \"Women Who Work\" is a multicultural collage of 25-to-35-year-old women who choose to work and are figuring out how to make their careers blend with starting a family and keeping the home together. Not one of the women pictured says, \"I don't want to have children,\" and not one is working at a typical industrial Rust Belt, lower-level office, or service-economy job-which is to say, the expected employment for most of the female American workforce. No one in this video says, \"I hate my boss.\" 25 Most of them seem to be their own bosses, or women who have started their own businesses. None of them are over 35, none are overweight; all are cisgendered. The Women Who Work are cookie- cutter, team-leader, go-getter gals, business-school graduates perhaps, all with good hair and makeup, nothing real or pained about them. There's no evidence that any of them have struggled. They all seem to be upper-middle-class, no matter their color or ethnic background. They're from a fantasy world in which every woman can get what she wants if only she works hard enough. 26 In another video, called \"Women Who Encourage,\" two reddish-haired women remove a clutch handbag from a gift box and then-one sitting and one standing, each in pink tops with black trousers, their coppery locks wafting-look tenderly at someone off to the right of the camera. This is how working women in Ivanka's virtual universe encourage each other: by offering things that are bought (preferably from IvankaTrump .com), rather than by leading a walkout at their place of employment, say, or by supporting one another when it comes to claims of sexual harassment. On Ivanka's website, conflict never exists. 27 IvankaTrump.com does have a section called \"Wise Words\" (\"Nothing is impossible. The word itself says 'I'm possible'\"-Audrey Hepburn; or \"It's never too late to be what you might have been,\" wrongly attributed to George Eliot; or \"Challenges are opportunities\"-so anodyne it's not attributed to anyone.) But you'll never read anything here about processing chickens or serving up burgers or sewing jeans, or what it's like to be a secretary, a receptionist, a nurse, a hairdresser, a teacher, a saleswoman, a waitress, a bookkeeper, a cashier, or any of the other jobs at which most American women work. 28 IvankaTrump.com prefers to address style and fashion, what you can buy for work and what you should wear to work, rather than the substance of work. It includes tips on how to get promoted and tips for thinking like a Harvard Business School graduate; it includes pages about yoga for the workday, as well as about entertaining and lifestyle and exercise and what to eat and what to serve. So far, wages, discrimination, and sexual harassment have not been on the radar, not even in a Lean In -lite kind of way. That's not the purpose of the website. It should be hashtagged #womenwhobuy. 29 This is what's known today as \"femvertising.\" The best thing one can say about Ivanka's retail celebration of women is that all of the women in her ads are portrayed as doing things for other women-the campaign is positively sapphic. Like all femvertising, IvankaTrump.com soft-pedals harsh realities; everything for working women comes wrapped in the gauze of love and encouragement and uplift and cool, calm niceness. Nothing on her site has to do with women's empowerment, because empowerment is political, and the politics of female empowerment must naturally take on the bastions of male power, which Ivanka isn't likely to do. Before the election, \"Women Who Work\" was part of her branding scheme, but now it's been retooled as a political scheme for her father's administration. The scheme should be beneficial both to the administration and to the brand, but not necessarily to women who actually work. 30 * * * 31 Anyway, silly me: I thought women who worked looked like Roseanne Barr, whose late-1980s sitcom embodied all the working women I knew growing up. Roseanne's eponymous character worked in a plastics factory, was often unemployed, took a fast-food job, was a telemarketer and later a bartender, and at some point-a low point-worked as a hair sweeper at a beauty salon. And, of course, she was a waitress. This is what life was like for the working women where I grew up, in sooty New Jersey, and also, apparently, in Barr's own Salt Lake City. (It turns out that the real Roseanne Barr, who ran for president in 2012, is now a slimmed-down, styled-up, face-fixed, and committed Hillary Clinton-hater-but I'm talking about the TV character, not the woman.) And if they didn't look like Roseanne, they were pert, exhausted office workers like Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Richards: put-upon, condescended to, and belittled by their boss and male co-workers. 32 In my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs. They didn't wear slim linen trousers and strappy heels and boxy pale cashmere V-necks to work, and they still don't. They wore stretch slacks and polyester blouses. They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?). And because so many women have to some degree internalized this oppressed version of self, Ivanka can seem like a role model. She is the working woman that the working women I knew in my youth may have dreamed they'd become when they first started to work.

Before the election, \"Women Who Work\" was part of her branding scheme, but now it's been retooled as a political scheme for her father's administration. The scheme should be beneficial both to the administration and to the brand, but not necessarily to women who actually work. 30 * * * 31 Anyway, silly me: I thought women who worked looked like Roseanne Barr, whose late-1980s sitcom embodied all the working women I knew growing up. Roseanne's eponymous character worked in a plastics factory, was often unemployed, took a fast-food job, was a telemarketer and later a bartender, and at some point-a low point-worked as a hair sweeper at a beauty salon. And, of course, she was a waitress. This is what life was like for the working women where I grew up, in sooty New Jersey, and also, apparently, in Barr's own Salt Lake City. (It turns out that the real Roseanne Barr, who ran for president in 2012, is now a slimmed-down, styled-up, face-fixed, and committed Hillary Clinton-hater-but I'm talking about the TV character, not the woman.) And if they didn't look like Roseanne, they were pert, exhausted office workers like Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Richards: put-upon, condescended to, and belittled by their boss and male co-workers. 32 In my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs. They didn't wear slim linen trousers and strappy heels and boxy pale cashmere V-necks to work, and they still don't. They wore stretch slacks and polyester blouses. They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?). And because so many women have to some degree internalized this oppressed version of self, Ivanka can seem like a role model. She is the working woman that the working women I knew in my youth may have dreamed they'd become when they first started to work. They thought perhaps they'd make enough money to have hair like that, teeth like that. Enough money, in other words, to be free of the grinding work they had to do just to get by. 36 * * * 37 So we gaze at the lovely Ivanka. How can we help it? She is an object of fascination. She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women. One of the things My Father has said about her illustrates precisely why Ivanka won't help women as a supposed presidential influencer. When asked, in the wake of the Roger Ailes scandal, how he'd feel if Ivanka were harassed at work, Trump replied that she would never allow that to happen: If a boss were foolish enough to bother her, she'd just go out and get a new job. 38 Because Ivanka Trump can do that. The rest of us can't. Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee of the 1970s-the one exceptional person who is hired and then used to prove that everything is fine for everyone else of their kind, when patently it is not. 39 Also, one has to remember the troupe of handmaids who make Ivanka's exceptional life possible. Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne? At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage. In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park. As she says, gesturing to the skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue and the whole sprawl of the green park: \"Not a bad view to wake up to.\" 42 Sometimes, women of this kind-pampered, raised to be unthinking and self-involved-can change and end up doing incredible things. But it's rare. And under the thumb of Donald Trump, as an extension of My Father, it's almost unimaginable. Women-so many of whom are underpaid, undervalued, disregarded, and abused-shouldn't think that they can put their fate into the hands of someone who, no matter how hard she's worked in her father's company, has no clue of what struggle really means. The fact that Ivanka is supposedly guiding women's policy shows just how little-not how much-My Father cares about it. 43 Editor's note : An earlier version of this article described Ivana Trump and her parents as Croatian. In fact, they are Czech. The text has been corrected. Listen to Amy Wilentz discuss Ivanka on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\n* * * 17 As a child, Ivanka was a total doll, an appendage and accessory for My Father. She was a golden, green-eyed, blond-haired thing, sweet-faced, alert, self-conscious, and, at 9 or 10 years old, already sexualized in a gold-lamé, lace-hemmed minidress, white pumps, gold jewelry, and a small, gold-chained gilt purse, her hair styled, her eyes watchful. In photos from the time, she always holds hands with My Father, more like a date than a daughter, while her mother Ivana trails them in the background (as Melania usually does today). 18 My Father could never keep his hands off Ivanka. In so many pictures of the two-as a child but especially as she begins to emerge into adulthood-Trump has his hands possessively on her waist or hips. Often, she's sitting coquettishly, Lolita-ishly, on his lap. In one much-viewed photograph, he's holding her there with his hands on her hips (she in a miniskirt, long legs aimed toward the camera), and she's cupping his chin as if he were her own dear love. To the side is a gilt statue of two large copulating birds. 19 Donald Trump with his daughter Ivanka at the Maybelline presents 1991 Look of the Year at Plaza Hotel in New York City, September 3, 1991. (Globe Photos/ZumaPress) Trump, of course, once told an interviewer that it would be OK to refer to his daughter as \"a piece of ass.\" In a later interview, he said: \"You know who's one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. My daughter, Ivanka. She's six feet tall. She's got the best body.\" When asked on The View whether Ivanka would ever pose for Playboy , Trump replied: \"I don't think Ivanka would do that inside the magazine. Although she does have a very nice figure. I've said that if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her.\" He can't stop talking about her body. 20 And yet, objectified as she certainly has been by this great big blustering objectifier of women, Ivanka has managed to pick up a lot of My Father's game. She's studied Trump and knows what he likes. He doesn't go for bookish girls, so when she went to Choate-one of the country's most exclusive prep schools-she also began working as a model (getting her first cover shoot, at age 15, for Seventeen ). After all, models and actresses are the women My Father marries. Then, after proving to him that she was marriageable, she went on to try to show that she could be him as well, by working at the Trump Organization. To be the Trump daughter, you must be a living contradiction in terms. You have to be a tough, rip-roaring negotiator and deal-closer like My Father, but you also have to be a sexy, leggy, fuckable babe who doesn't give much trouble. You have to be a Trump and a target for Trump. 21 In my hometown, the women who worked smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits. No matter how much Ivanka talks about what a great parent My Father was, Trump-more available to her than to any of his other children-was still not very present. He called a lot. And he took her calls; she brags about this. He provided special treats, vacations, presents. She certainly knew that to a large degree he held the reins of her inheritance. But My Father said flat out that he didn't like to care for children; men who change diapers, he's opined, are \"acting like the wife.\" The day-to-day rearing of Ivanka and her two brothers was done by four people: two Irish nannies and Ivana Trump's Czech parents, Milos and Maria. As Bill Maher once said about Trump's kids, they're like his real-estate projects: He doesn't build 'em, but he slaps his name on 'em. 22 What this set of paternal behaviors seems to have wrought in Ivanka's character is a woman who looks at herself and other women via the male gaze. She sees herself through My Father's eyes. Look at her: Of course she's pretty and young and has a great smile. But she's also ultrafeminized-a walking advertisement. She's beyond us, better than us, like a thoroughbred. She's a virtual Miss Universe runner-up, a created feminine figure-unreal, fixed, sculpted, and styled, done up and made up, invented as a female object. 23 * * * 24 Like any good Trump, Ivanka has erected an empire atop this act of self-creation, in her case at IvankaTrump.com, a retail-cum-inspirational website where \"Women Who Work\" is a prominent channel. The video that introduces \"Women Who Work\" is a multicultural collage of 25-to-35-year-old women who choose to work and are figuring out how to make their careers blend with starting a family and keeping the home together. Not one of the women pictured says, \"I don't want to have children,\" and not one is working at a typical industrial Rust Belt, lower-level office, or service-economy job-which is to say, the expected employment for most of the female American workforce. No one in this video says, \"I hate my boss.\" 25 Most of them seem to be their own bosses, or women who have started their own businesses. None of them are over 35, none are overweight; all are cisgendered. The Women Who Work are cookie- cutter, team-leader, go-getter gals, business-school graduates perhaps, all with good hair and makeup, nothing real or pained about them. There's no evidence that any of them have struggled. They all seem to be upper-middle-class, no matter their color or ethnic background. They're from a fantasy world in which every woman can get what she wants if only she works hard enough. 26 In another video, called \"Women Who Encourage,\" two reddish-haired women remove a clutch handbag from a gift box and then-one sitting and one standing, each in pink tops with black trousers, their coppery locks wafting-look tenderly at someone off to the right of the camera. This is how working women in Ivanka's virtual universe encourage each other: by offering things that are bought (preferably from IvankaTrump .com), rather than by leading a walkout at their place of employment, say, or by supporting one another when it comes to claims of sexual harassment. On Ivanka's website, conflict never exists. 27 IvankaTrump.com does have a section called \"Wise Words\" (\"Nothing is impossible. The word itself says 'I'm possible'\"-Audrey Hepburn; or \"It's never too late to be what you might have been,\" wrongly attributed to George Eliot; or \"Challenges are opportunities\"-so anodyne it's not attributed to anyone.) But you'll never read anything here about processing chickens or serving up burgers or sewing jeans, or what it's like to be a secretary, a receptionist, a nurse, a hairdresser, a teacher, a saleswoman, a waitress, a bookkeeper, a cashier, or any of the other jobs at which most American women work. 28 IvankaTrump.com prefers to address style and fashion, what you can buy for work and what you should wear to work, rather than the substance of work. It includes tips on how to get promoted and tips for thinking like a Harvard Business School graduate; it includes pages about yoga for the workday, as well as about entertaining and lifestyle and exercise and what to eat and what to serve. So far, wages, discrimination, and sexual harassment have not been on the radar, not even in a Lean In -lite kind of way. That's not the purpose of the website. It should be hashtagged #womenwhobuy. 29 This is what's known today as \"femvertising.\" The best thing one can say about Ivanka's retail celebration of women is that all of the women in her ads are portrayed as doing things for other women-the campaign is positively sapphic.

And, of course, she was a waitress. This is what life was like for the working women where I grew up, in sooty New Jersey, and also, apparently, in Barr's own Salt Lake City. (It turns out that the real Roseanne Barr, who ran for president in 2012, is now a slimmed-down, styled-up, face-fixed, and committed Hillary Clinton-hater-but I'm talking about the TV character, not the woman.) And if they didn't look like Roseanne, they were pert, exhausted office workers like Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Richards: put-upon, condescended to, and belittled by their boss and male co-workers. 32 In my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs. They didn't wear slim linen trousers and strappy heels and boxy pale cashmere V-necks to work, and they still don't. They wore stretch slacks and polyester blouses. They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?). And because so many women have to some degree internalized this oppressed version of self, Ivanka can seem like a role model. She is the working woman that the working women I knew in my youth may have dreamed they'd become when they first started to work. They thought perhaps they'd make enough money to have hair like that, teeth like that. Enough money, in other words, to be free of the grinding work they had to do just to get by. 36 * * * 37 So we gaze at the lovely Ivanka. How can we help it? She is an object of fascination. She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women. One of the things My Father has said about her illustrates precisely why Ivanka won't help women as a supposed presidential influencer. When asked, in the wake of the Roger Ailes scandal, how he'd feel if Ivanka were harassed at work, Trump replied that she would never allow that to happen: If a boss were foolish enough to bother her, she'd just go out and get a new job. 38 Because Ivanka Trump can do that. The rest of us can't. Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee of the 1970s-the one exceptional person who is hired and then used to prove that everything is fine for everyone else of their kind, when patently it is not. 39 Also, one has to remember the troupe of handmaids who make Ivanka's exceptional life possible. Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne? At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage. In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park. As she says, gesturing to the skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue and the whole sprawl of the green park: \"Not a bad view to wake up to.\" 42 Sometimes, women of this kind-pampered, raised to be unthinking and self-involved-can change and end up doing incredible things. But it's rare. And under the thumb of Donald Trump, as an extension of My Father, it's almost unimaginable. Women-so many of whom are underpaid, undervalued, disregarded, and abused-shouldn't think that they can put their fate into the hands of someone who, no matter how hard she's worked in her father's company, has no clue of what struggle really means. The fact that Ivanka is supposedly guiding women's policy shows just how little-not how much-My Father cares about it. 43 Editor's note : An earlier version of this article described Ivana Trump and her parents as Croatian. In fact, they are Czech. The text has been corrected. Listen to Amy Wilentz discuss Ivanka on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\nMy Father could never keep his hands off Ivanka. In so many pictures of the two-as a child but especially as she begins to emerge into adulthood-Trump has his hands possessively on her waist or hips. Often, she's sitting coquettishly, Lolita-ishly, on his lap. In one much-viewed photograph, he's holding her there with his hands on her hips (she in a miniskirt, long legs aimed toward the camera), and she's cupping his chin as if he were her own dear love. To the side is a gilt statue of two large copulating birds. 19 Donald Trump with his daughter Ivanka at the Maybelline presents 1991 Look of the Year at Plaza Hotel in New York City, September 3, 1991. (Globe Photos/ZumaPress) Trump, of course, once told an interviewer that it would be OK to refer to his daughter as \"a piece of ass.\" In a later interview, he said: \"You know who's one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. My daughter, Ivanka. She's six feet tall. She's got the best body.\" When asked on The View whether Ivanka would ever pose for Playboy , Trump replied: \"I don't think Ivanka would do that inside the magazine. Although she does have a very nice figure. I've said that if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her.\" He can't stop talking about her body. 20 And yet, objectified as she certainly has been by this great big blustering objectifier of women, Ivanka has managed to pick up a lot of My Father's game. She's studied Trump and knows what he likes. He doesn't go for bookish girls, so when she went to Choate-one of the country's most exclusive prep schools-she also began working as a model (getting her first cover shoot, at age 15, for Seventeen ). After all, models and actresses are the women My Father marries. Then, after proving to him that she was marriageable, she went on to try to show that she could be him as well, by working at the Trump Organization. To be the Trump daughter, you must be a living contradiction in terms. You have to be a tough, rip-roaring negotiator and deal-closer like My Father, but you also have to be a sexy, leggy, fuckable babe who doesn't give much trouble. You have to be a Trump and a target for Trump. 21 In my hometown, the women who worked smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits. No matter how much Ivanka talks about what a great parent My Father was, Trump-more available to her than to any of his other children-was still not very present. He called a lot. And he took her calls; she brags about this. He provided special treats, vacations, presents. She certainly knew that to a large degree he held the reins of her inheritance. But My Father said flat out that he didn't like to care for children; men who change diapers, he's opined, are \"acting like the wife.\" The day-to-day rearing of Ivanka and her two brothers was done by four people: two Irish nannies and Ivana Trump's Czech parents, Milos and Maria. As Bill Maher once said about Trump's kids, they're like his real-estate projects: He doesn't build 'em, but he slaps his name on 'em. 22 What this set of paternal behaviors seems to have wrought in Ivanka's character is a woman who looks at herself and other women via the male gaze. She sees herself through My Father's eyes. Look at her: Of course she's pretty and young and has a great smile. But she's also ultrafeminized-a walking advertisement. She's beyond us, better than us, like a thoroughbred. She's a virtual Miss Universe runner-up, a created feminine figure-unreal, fixed, sculpted, and styled, done up and made up, invented as a female object. 23 * * * 24 Like any good Trump, Ivanka has erected an empire atop this act of self-creation, in her case at IvankaTrump.com, a retail-cum-inspirational website where \"Women Who Work\" is a prominent channel. The video that introduces \"Women Who Work\" is a multicultural collage of 25-to-35-year-old women who choose to work and are figuring out how to make their careers blend with starting a family and keeping the home together. Not one of the women pictured says, \"I don't want to have children,\" and not one is working at a typical industrial Rust Belt, lower-level office, or service-economy job-which is to say, the expected employment for most of the female American workforce. No one in this video says, \"I hate my boss.\" 25 Most of them seem to be their own bosses, or women who have started their own businesses. None of them are over 35, none are overweight; all are cisgendered. The Women Who Work are cookie- cutter, team-leader, go-getter gals, business-school graduates perhaps, all with good hair and makeup, nothing real or pained about them. There's no evidence that any of them have struggled. They all seem to be upper-middle-class, no matter their color or ethnic background. They're from a fantasy world in which every woman can get what she wants if only she works hard enough. 26 In another video, called \"Women Who Encourage,\" two reddish-haired women remove a clutch handbag from a gift box and then-one sitting and one standing, each in pink tops with black trousers, their coppery locks wafting-look tenderly at someone off to the right of the camera. This is how working women in Ivanka's virtual universe encourage each other: by offering things that are bought (preferably from IvankaTrump .com), rather than by leading a walkout at their place of employment, say, or by supporting one another when it comes to claims of sexual harassment. On Ivanka's website, conflict never exists. 27 IvankaTrump.com does have a section called \"Wise Words\" (\"Nothing is impossible. The word itself says 'I'm possible'\"-Audrey Hepburn; or \"It's never too late to be what you might have been,\" wrongly attributed to George Eliot; or \"Challenges are opportunities\"-so anodyne it's not attributed to anyone.) But you'll never read anything here about processing chickens or serving up burgers or sewing jeans, or what it's like to be a secretary, a receptionist, a nurse, a hairdresser, a teacher, a saleswoman, a waitress, a bookkeeper, a cashier, or any of the other jobs at which most American women work. 28 IvankaTrump.com prefers to address style and fashion, what you can buy for work and what you should wear to work, rather than the substance of work. It includes tips on how to get promoted and tips for thinking like a Harvard Business School graduate; it includes pages about yoga for the workday, as well as about entertaining and lifestyle and exercise and what to eat and what to serve. So far, wages, discrimination, and sexual harassment have not been on the radar, not even in a Lean In -lite kind of way. That's not the purpose of the website. It should be hashtagged #womenwhobuy. 29 This is what's known today as \"femvertising.\" The best thing one can say about Ivanka's retail celebration of women is that all of the women in her ads are portrayed as doing things for other women-the campaign is positively sapphic. Like all femvertising, IvankaTrump.com soft-pedals harsh realities; everything for working women comes wrapped in the gauze of love and encouragement and uplift and cool, calm niceness. Nothing on her site has to do with women's empowerment, because empowerment is political, and the politics of female empowerment must naturally take on the bastions of male power, which Ivanka isn't likely to do. Before the election, \"Women Who Work\" was part of her branding scheme, but now it's been retooled as a political scheme for her father's administration. The scheme should be beneficial both to the administration and to the brand, but not necessarily to women who actually work. 30 * * * 31 Anyway, silly me: I thought women who worked looked like Roseanne Barr, whose late-1980s sitcom embodied all the working women I knew growing up.

That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?). And because so many women have to some degree internalized this oppressed version of self, Ivanka can seem like a role model. She is the working woman that the working women I knew in my youth may have dreamed they'd become when they first started to work. They thought perhaps they'd make enough money to have hair like that, teeth like that. Enough money, in other words, to be free of the grinding work they had to do just to get by. 36 * * * 37 So we gaze at the lovely Ivanka. How can we help it? She is an object of fascination. She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women. One of the things My Father has said about her illustrates precisely why Ivanka won't help women as a supposed presidential influencer. When asked, in the wake of the Roger Ailes scandal, how he'd feel if Ivanka were harassed at work, Trump replied that she would never allow that to happen: If a boss were foolish enough to bother her, she'd just go out and get a new job. 38 Because Ivanka Trump can do that. The rest of us can't. Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee of the 1970s-the one exceptional person who is hired and then used to prove that everything is fine for everyone else of their kind, when patently it is not. 39 Also, one has to remember the troupe of handmaids who make Ivanka's exceptional life possible. Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne? At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage. In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park. As she says, gesturing to the skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue and the whole sprawl of the green park: \"Not a bad view to wake up to.\" 42 Sometimes, women of this kind-pampered, raised to be unthinking and self-involved-can change and end up doing incredible things. But it's rare. And under the thumb of Donald Trump, as an extension of My Father, it's almost unimaginable. Women-so many of whom are underpaid, undervalued, disregarded, and abused-shouldn't think that they can put their fate into the hands of someone who, no matter how hard she's worked in her father's company, has no clue of what struggle really means. The fact that Ivanka is supposedly guiding women's policy shows just how little-not how much-My Father cares about it. 43 Editor's note : An earlier version of this article described Ivana Trump and her parents as Croatian. In fact, they are Czech. The text has been corrected. Listen to Amy Wilentz discuss Ivanka on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\nAnd yet, objectified as she certainly has been by this great big blustering objectifier of women, Ivanka has managed to pick up a lot of My Father's game. She's studied Trump and knows what he likes. He doesn't go for bookish girls, so when she went to Choate-one of the country's most exclusive prep schools-she also began working as a model (getting her first cover shoot, at age 15, for Seventeen ). After all, models and actresses are the women My Father marries. Then, after proving to him that she was marriageable, she went on to try to show that she could be him as well, by working at the Trump Organization. To be the Trump daughter, you must be a living contradiction in terms. You have to be a tough, rip-roaring negotiator and deal-closer like My Father, but you also have to be a sexy, leggy, fuckable babe who doesn't give much trouble. You have to be a Trump and a target for Trump. 21 In my hometown, the women who worked smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits. No matter how much Ivanka talks about what a great parent My Father was, Trump-more available to her than to any of his other children-was still not very present. He called a lot. And he took her calls; she brags about this. He provided special treats, vacations, presents. She certainly knew that to a large degree he held the reins of her inheritance. But My Father said flat out that he didn't like to care for children; men who change diapers, he's opined, are \"acting like the wife.\" The day-to-day rearing of Ivanka and her two brothers was done by four people: two Irish nannies and Ivana Trump's Czech parents, Milos and Maria. As Bill Maher once said about Trump's kids, they're like his real-estate projects: He doesn't build 'em, but he slaps his name on 'em. 22 What this set of paternal behaviors seems to have wrought in Ivanka's character is a woman who looks at herself and other women via the male gaze. She sees herself through My Father's eyes. Look at her: Of course she's pretty and young and has a great smile. But she's also ultrafeminized-a walking advertisement. She's beyond us, better than us, like a thoroughbred. She's a virtual Miss Universe runner-up, a created feminine figure-unreal, fixed, sculpted, and styled, done up and made up, invented as a female object. 23 * * * 24 Like any good Trump, Ivanka has erected an empire atop this act of self-creation, in her case at IvankaTrump.com, a retail-cum-inspirational website where \"Women Who Work\" is a prominent channel. The video that introduces \"Women Who Work\" is a multicultural collage of 25-to-35-year-old women who choose to work and are figuring out how to make their careers blend with starting a family and keeping the home together. Not one of the women pictured says, \"I don't want to have children,\" and not one is working at a typical industrial Rust Belt, lower-level office, or service-economy job-which is to say, the expected employment for most of the female American workforce. No one in this video says, \"I hate my boss.\" 25 Most of them seem to be their own bosses, or women who have started their own businesses. None of them are over 35, none are overweight; all are cisgendered. The Women Who Work are cookie- cutter, team-leader, go-getter gals, business-school graduates perhaps, all with good hair and makeup, nothing real or pained about them. There's no evidence that any of them have struggled. They all seem to be upper-middle-class, no matter their color or ethnic background. They're from a fantasy world in which every woman can get what she wants if only she works hard enough. 26 In another video, called \"Women Who Encourage,\" two reddish-haired women remove a clutch handbag from a gift box and then-one sitting and one standing, each in pink tops with black trousers, their coppery locks wafting-look tenderly at someone off to the right of the camera. This is how working women in Ivanka's virtual universe encourage each other: by offering things that are bought (preferably from IvankaTrump .com), rather than by leading a walkout at their place of employment, say, or by supporting one another when it comes to claims of sexual harassment. On Ivanka's website, conflict never exists. 27 IvankaTrump.com does have a section called \"Wise Words\" (\"Nothing is impossible. The word itself says 'I'm possible'\"-Audrey Hepburn; or \"It's never too late to be what you might have been,\" wrongly attributed to George Eliot; or \"Challenges are opportunities\"-so anodyne it's not attributed to anyone.) But you'll never read anything here about processing chickens or serving up burgers or sewing jeans, or what it's like to be a secretary, a receptionist, a nurse, a hairdresser, a teacher, a saleswoman, a waitress, a bookkeeper, a cashier, or any of the other jobs at which most American women work. 28 IvankaTrump.com prefers to address style and fashion, what you can buy for work and what you should wear to work, rather than the substance of work. It includes tips on how to get promoted and tips for thinking like a Harvard Business School graduate; it includes pages about yoga for the workday, as well as about entertaining and lifestyle and exercise and what to eat and what to serve. So far, wages, discrimination, and sexual harassment have not been on the radar, not even in a Lean In -lite kind of way. That's not the purpose of the website. It should be hashtagged #womenwhobuy. 29 This is what's known today as \"femvertising.\" The best thing one can say about Ivanka's retail celebration of women is that all of the women in her ads are portrayed as doing things for other women-the campaign is positively sapphic. Like all femvertising, IvankaTrump.com soft-pedals harsh realities; everything for working women comes wrapped in the gauze of love and encouragement and uplift and cool, calm niceness. Nothing on her site has to do with women's empowerment, because empowerment is political, and the politics of female empowerment must naturally take on the bastions of male power, which Ivanka isn't likely to do. Before the election, \"Women Who Work\" was part of her branding scheme, but now it's been retooled as a political scheme for her father's administration. The scheme should be beneficial both to the administration and to the brand, but not necessarily to women who actually work. 30 * * * 31 Anyway, silly me: I thought women who worked looked like Roseanne Barr, whose late-1980s sitcom embodied all the working women I knew growing up. Roseanne's eponymous character worked in a plastics factory, was often unemployed, took a fast-food job, was a telemarketer and later a bartender, and at some point-a low point-worked as a hair sweeper at a beauty salon. And, of course, she was a waitress. This is what life was like for the working women where I grew up, in sooty New Jersey, and also, apparently, in Barr's own Salt Lake City. (It turns out that the real Roseanne Barr, who ran for president in 2012, is now a slimmed-down, styled-up, face-fixed, and committed Hillary Clinton-hater-but I'm talking about the TV character, not the woman.) And if they didn't look like Roseanne, they were pert, exhausted office workers like Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Richards: put-upon, condescended to, and belittled by their boss and male co-workers. 32 In my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs. They didn't wear slim linen trousers and strappy heels and boxy pale cashmere V-necks to work, and they still don't. They wore stretch slacks and polyester blouses. They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked.

She's a virtual Miss Universe runner-up, a created feminine figure-unreal, fixed, sculpted, and styled, done up and made up, invented as a female object. 23 * * * 24 Like any good Trump, Ivanka has erected an empire atop this act of self-creation, in her case at IvankaTrump.com, a retail-cum-inspirational website where \"Women Who Work\" is a prominent channel. The video that introduces \"Women Who Work\" is a multicultural collage of 25-to-35-year-old women who choose to work and are figuring out how to make their careers blend with starting a family and keeping the home together. Not one of the women pictured says, \"I don't want to have children,\" and not one is working at a typical industrial Rust Belt, lower-level office, or service-economy job-which is to say, the expected employment for most of the female American workforce. No one in this video says, \"I hate my boss.\" 25 Most of them seem to be their own bosses, or women who have started their own businesses. None of them are over 35, none are overweight; all are cisgendered. The Women Who Work are cookie- cutter, team-leader, go-getter gals, business-school graduates perhaps, all with good hair and makeup, nothing real or pained about them. There's no evidence that any of them have struggled. They all seem to be upper-middle-class, no matter their color or ethnic background. They're from a fantasy world in which every woman can get what she wants if only she works hard enough. 26 In another video, called \"Women Who Encourage,\" two reddish-haired women remove a clutch handbag from a gift box and then-one sitting and one standing, each in pink tops with black trousers, their coppery locks wafting-look tenderly at someone off to the right of the camera. This is how working women in Ivanka's virtual universe encourage each other: by offering things that are bought (preferably from IvankaTrump .com), rather than by leading a walkout at their place of employment, say, or by supporting one another when it comes to claims of sexual harassment. On Ivanka's website, conflict never exists. 27 IvankaTrump.com does have a section called \"Wise Words\" (\"Nothing is impossible. The word itself says 'I'm possible'\"-Audrey Hepburn; or \"It's never too late to be what you might have been,\" wrongly attributed to George Eliot; or \"Challenges are opportunities\"-so anodyne it's not attributed to anyone.) But you'll never read anything here about processing chickens or serving up burgers or sewing jeans, or what it's like to be a secretary, a receptionist, a nurse, a hairdresser, a teacher, a saleswoman, a waitress, a bookkeeper, a cashier, or any of the other jobs at which most American women work. 28 IvankaTrump.com prefers to address style and fashion, what you can buy for work and what you should wear to work, rather than the substance of work. It includes tips on how to get promoted and tips for thinking like a Harvard Business School graduate; it includes pages about yoga for the workday, as well as about entertaining and lifestyle and exercise and what to eat and what to serve. So far, wages, discrimination, and sexual harassment have not been on the radar, not even in a Lean In -lite kind of way. That's not the purpose of the website. It should be hashtagged #womenwhobuy. 29 This is what's known today as \"femvertising.\" The best thing one can say about Ivanka's retail celebration of women is that all of the women in her ads are portrayed as doing things for other women-the campaign is positively sapphic. Like all femvertising, IvankaTrump.com soft-pedals harsh realities; everything for working women comes wrapped in the gauze of love and encouragement and uplift and cool, calm niceness. Nothing on her site has to do with women's empowerment, because empowerment is political, and the politics of female empowerment must naturally take on the bastions of male power, which Ivanka isn't likely to do. Before the election, \"Women Who Work\" was part of her branding scheme, but now it's been retooled as a political scheme for her father's administration. The scheme should be beneficial both to the administration and to the brand, but not necessarily to women who actually work. 30 * * * 31 Anyway, silly me: I thought women who worked looked like Roseanne Barr, whose late-1980s sitcom embodied all the working women I knew growing up. Roseanne's eponymous character worked in a plastics factory, was often unemployed, took a fast-food job, was a telemarketer and later a bartender, and at some point-a low point-worked as a hair sweeper at a beauty salon. And, of course, she was a waitress. This is what life was like for the working women where I grew up, in sooty New Jersey, and also, apparently, in Barr's own Salt Lake City. (It turns out that the real Roseanne Barr, who ran for president in 2012, is now a slimmed-down, styled-up, face-fixed, and committed Hillary Clinton-hater-but I'm talking about the TV character, not the woman.) And if they didn't look like Roseanne, they were pert, exhausted office workers like Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Richards: put-upon, condescended to, and belittled by their boss and male co-workers. 32 In my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs. They didn't wear slim linen trousers and strappy heels and boxy pale cashmere V-necks to work, and they still don't. They wore stretch slacks and polyester blouses. They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?). And because so many women have to some degree internalized this oppressed version of self, Ivanka can seem like a role model. She is the working woman that the working women I knew in my youth may have dreamed they'd become when they first started to work. They thought perhaps they'd make enough money to have hair like that, teeth like that. Enough money, in other words, to be free of the grinding work they had to do just to get by. 36 * * * 37 So we gaze at the lovely Ivanka. How can we help it? She is an object of fascination. She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women. One of the things My Father has said about her illustrates precisely why Ivanka won't help women as a supposed presidential influencer. When asked, in the wake of the Roger Ailes scandal, how he'd feel if Ivanka were harassed at work, Trump replied that she would never allow that to happen: If a boss were foolish enough to bother her, she'd just go out and get a new job. 38 Because Ivanka Trump can do that. The rest of us can't. Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee of the 1970s-the one exceptional person who is hired and then used to prove that everything is fine for everyone else of their kind, when patently it is not. 39 Also, one has to remember the troupe of handmaids who make Ivanka's exceptional life possible. Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne? At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage. In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park. As she says, gesturing to the skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue and the whole sprawl of the green park: \"Not a bad view to wake up to.\" 42 Sometimes, women of this kind-pampered, raised to be unthinking and self-involved-can change and end up doing incredible things. But it's rare. And under the thumb of Donald Trump, as an extension of My Father, it's almost unimaginable. Women-so many of whom are underpaid, undervalued, disregarded, and abused-shouldn't think that they can put their fate into the hands of someone who, no matter how hard she's worked in her father's company, has no clue of what struggle really means. The fact that Ivanka is supposedly guiding women's policy shows just how little-not how much-My Father cares about it. 43 Editor's note : An earlier version of this article described Ivana Trump and her parents as Croatian. In fact, they are Czech. The text has been corrected.

At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage. In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park. As she says, gesturing to the skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue and the whole sprawl of the green park: \"Not a bad view to wake up to.\" 42 Sometimes, women of this kind-pampered, raised to be unthinking and self-involved-can change and end up doing incredible things. But it's rare. And under the thumb of Donald Trump, as an extension of My Father, it's almost unimaginable. Women-so many of whom are underpaid, undervalued, disregarded, and abused-shouldn't think that they can put their fate into the hands of someone who, no matter how hard she's worked in her father's company, has no clue of what struggle really means. The fact that Ivanka is supposedly guiding women's policy shows just how little-not how much-My Father cares about it. 43 Editor's note : An earlier version of this article described Ivana Trump and her parents as Croatian. In fact, they are Czech. The text has been corrected. Listen to Amy Wilentz discuss Ivanka on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\nMost of them seem to be their own bosses, or women who have started their own businesses. None of them are over 35, none are overweight; all are cisgendered. The Women Who Work are cookie- cutter, team-leader, go-getter gals, business-school graduates perhaps, all with good hair and makeup, nothing real or pained about them. There's no evidence that any of them have struggled. They all seem to be upper-middle-class, no matter their color or ethnic background. They're from a fantasy world in which every woman can get what she wants if only she works hard enough. 26 In another video, called \"Women Who Encourage,\" two reddish-haired women remove a clutch handbag from a gift box and then-one sitting and one standing, each in pink tops with black trousers, their coppery locks wafting-look tenderly at someone off to the right of the camera. This is how working women in Ivanka's virtual universe encourage each other: by offering things that are bought (preferably from IvankaTrump .com), rather than by leading a walkout at their place of employment, say, or by supporting one another when it comes to claims of sexual harassment. On Ivanka's website, conflict never exists. 27 IvankaTrump.com does have a section called \"Wise Words\" (\"Nothing is impossible. The word itself says 'I'm possible'\"-Audrey Hepburn; or \"It's never too late to be what you might have been,\" wrongly attributed to George Eliot; or \"Challenges are opportunities\"-so anodyne it's not attributed to anyone.) But you'll never read anything here about processing chickens or serving up burgers or sewing jeans, or what it's like to be a secretary, a receptionist, a nurse, a hairdresser, a teacher, a saleswoman, a waitress, a bookkeeper, a cashier, or any of the other jobs at which most American women work. 28 IvankaTrump.com prefers to address style and fashion, what you can buy for work and what you should wear to work, rather than the substance of work. It includes tips on how to get promoted and tips for thinking like a Harvard Business School graduate; it includes pages about yoga for the workday, as well as about entertaining and lifestyle and exercise and what to eat and what to serve. So far, wages, discrimination, and sexual harassment have not been on the radar, not even in a Lean In -lite kind of way. That's not the purpose of the website. It should be hashtagged #womenwhobuy. 29 This is what's known today as \"femvertising.\" The best thing one can say about Ivanka's retail celebration of women is that all of the women in her ads are portrayed as doing things for other women-the campaign is positively sapphic. Like all femvertising, IvankaTrump.com soft-pedals harsh realities; everything for working women comes wrapped in the gauze of love and encouragement and uplift and cool, calm niceness. Nothing on her site has to do with women's empowerment, because empowerment is political, and the politics of female empowerment must naturally take on the bastions of male power, which Ivanka isn't likely to do. Before the election, \"Women Who Work\" was part of her branding scheme, but now it's been retooled as a political scheme for her father's administration. The scheme should be beneficial both to the administration and to the brand, but not necessarily to women who actually work. 30 * * * 31 Anyway, silly me: I thought women who worked looked like Roseanne Barr, whose late-1980s sitcom embodied all the working women I knew growing up. Roseanne's eponymous character worked in a plastics factory, was often unemployed, took a fast-food job, was a telemarketer and later a bartender, and at some point-a low point-worked as a hair sweeper at a beauty salon. And, of course, she was a waitress. This is what life was like for the working women where I grew up, in sooty New Jersey, and also, apparently, in Barr's own Salt Lake City. (It turns out that the real Roseanne Barr, who ran for president in 2012, is now a slimmed-down, styled-up, face-fixed, and committed Hillary Clinton-hater-but I'm talking about the TV character, not the woman.) And if they didn't look like Roseanne, they were pert, exhausted office workers like Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Richards: put-upon, condescended to, and belittled by their boss and male co-workers. 32 In my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs. They didn't wear slim linen trousers and strappy heels and boxy pale cashmere V-necks to work, and they still don't. They wore stretch slacks and polyester blouses. They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?). And because so many women have to some degree internalized this oppressed version of self, Ivanka can seem like a role model. She is the working woman that the working women I knew in my youth may have dreamed they'd become when they first started to work. They thought perhaps they'd make enough money to have hair like that, teeth like that. Enough money, in other words, to be free of the grinding work they had to do just to get by. 36 * * * 37 So we gaze at the lovely Ivanka. How can we help it? She is an object of fascination. She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women. One of the things My Father has said about her illustrates precisely why Ivanka won't help women as a supposed presidential influencer. When asked, in the wake of the Roger Ailes scandal, how he'd feel if Ivanka were harassed at work, Trump replied that she would never allow that to happen: If a boss were foolish enough to bother her, she'd just go out and get a new job. 38 Because Ivanka Trump can do that. The rest of us can't. Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee of the 1970s-the one exceptional person who is hired and then used to prove that everything is fine for everyone else of their kind, when patently it is not. 39 Also, one has to remember the troupe of handmaids who make Ivanka's exceptional life possible. Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible.

Women-so many of whom are underpaid, undervalued, disregarded, and abused-shouldn't think that they can put their fate into the hands of someone who, no matter how hard she's worked in her father's company, has no clue of what struggle really means. The fact that Ivanka is supposedly guiding women's policy shows just how little-not how much-My Father cares about it. 43 Editor's note : An earlier version of this article described Ivana Trump and her parents as Croatian. In fact, they are Czech. The text has been corrected. Listen to Amy Wilentz discuss Ivanka on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\nIvankaTrump.com prefers to address style and fashion, what you can buy for work and what you should wear to work, rather than the substance of work. It includes tips on how to get promoted and tips for thinking like a Harvard Business School graduate; it includes pages about yoga for the workday, as well as about entertaining and lifestyle and exercise and what to eat and what to serve. So far, wages, discrimination, and sexual harassment have not been on the radar, not even in a Lean In -lite kind of way. That's not the purpose of the website. It should be hashtagged #womenwhobuy. 29 This is what's known today as \"femvertising.\" The best thing one can say about Ivanka's retail celebration of women is that all of the women in her ads are portrayed as doing things for other women-the campaign is positively sapphic. Like all femvertising, IvankaTrump.com soft-pedals harsh realities; everything for working women comes wrapped in the gauze of love and encouragement and uplift and cool, calm niceness. Nothing on her site has to do with women's empowerment, because empowerment is political, and the politics of female empowerment must naturally take on the bastions of male power, which Ivanka isn't likely to do. Before the election, \"Women Who Work\" was part of her branding scheme, but now it's been retooled as a political scheme for her father's administration. The scheme should be beneficial both to the administration and to the brand, but not necessarily to women who actually work. 30 * * * 31 Anyway, silly me: I thought women who worked looked like Roseanne Barr, whose late-1980s sitcom embodied all the working women I knew growing up. Roseanne's eponymous character worked in a plastics factory, was often unemployed, took a fast-food job, was a telemarketer and later a bartender, and at some point-a low point-worked as a hair sweeper at a beauty salon. And, of course, she was a waitress. This is what life was like for the working women where I grew up, in sooty New Jersey, and also, apparently, in Barr's own Salt Lake City. (It turns out that the real Roseanne Barr, who ran for president in 2012, is now a slimmed-down, styled-up, face-fixed, and committed Hillary Clinton-hater-but I'm talking about the TV character, not the woman.) And if they didn't look like Roseanne, they were pert, exhausted office workers like Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Richards: put-upon, condescended to, and belittled by their boss and male co-workers. 32 In my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs. They didn't wear slim linen trousers and strappy heels and boxy pale cashmere V-necks to work, and they still don't. They wore stretch slacks and polyester blouses. They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?). And because so many women have to some degree internalized this oppressed version of self, Ivanka can seem like a role model. She is the working woman that the working women I knew in my youth may have dreamed they'd become when they first started to work. They thought perhaps they'd make enough money to have hair like that, teeth like that. Enough money, in other words, to be free of the grinding work they had to do just to get by. 36 * * * 37 So we gaze at the lovely Ivanka. How can we help it? She is an object of fascination. She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women. One of the things My Father has said about her illustrates precisely why Ivanka won't help women as a supposed presidential influencer. When asked, in the wake of the Roger Ailes scandal, how he'd feel if Ivanka were harassed at work, Trump replied that she would never allow that to happen: If a boss were foolish enough to bother her, she'd just go out and get a new job. 38 Because Ivanka Trump can do that. The rest of us can't. Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee of the 1970s-the one exceptional person who is hired and then used to prove that everything is fine for everyone else of their kind, when patently it is not. 39 Also, one has to remember the troupe of handmaids who make Ivanka's exceptional life possible. Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne? At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage. In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park. As she says, gesturing to the skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue and the whole sprawl of the green park: \"Not a bad view to wake up to.\" 42 Sometimes, women of this kind-pampered, raised to be unthinking and self-involved-can change and end up doing incredible things.

In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park. As she says, gesturing to the skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue and the whole sprawl of the green park: \"Not a bad view to wake up to.\" 42 Sometimes, women of this kind-pampered, raised to be unthinking and self-involved-can change and end up doing incredible things. But it's rare. And under the thumb of Donald Trump, as an extension of My Father, it's almost unimaginable. Women-so many of whom are underpaid, undervalued, disregarded, and abused-shouldn't think that they can put their fate into the hands of someone who, no matter how hard she's worked in her father's company, has no clue of what struggle really means. The fact that Ivanka is supposedly guiding women's policy shows just how little-not how much-My Father cares about it. 43 Editor's note : An earlier version of this article described Ivana Trump and her parents as Croatian. In fact, they are Czech. The text has been corrected. Listen to Amy Wilentz discuss Ivanka on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\nIn my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs. They didn't wear slim linen trousers and strappy heels and boxy pale cashmere V-necks to work, and they still don't. They wore stretch slacks and polyester blouses. They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?). And because so many women have to some degree internalized this oppressed version of self, Ivanka can seem like a role model. She is the working woman that the working women I knew in my youth may have dreamed they'd become when they first started to work. They thought perhaps they'd make enough money to have hair like that, teeth like that. Enough money, in other words, to be free of the grinding work they had to do just to get by. 36 * * * 37 So we gaze at the lovely Ivanka. How can we help it? She is an object of fascination. She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women. One of the things My Father has said about her illustrates precisely why Ivanka won't help women as a supposed presidential influencer. When asked, in the wake of the Roger Ailes scandal, how he'd feel if Ivanka were harassed at work, Trump replied that she would never allow that to happen: If a boss were foolish enough to bother her, she'd just go out and get a new job. 38 Because Ivanka Trump can do that. The rest of us can't. Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee of the 1970s-the one exceptional person who is hired and then used to prove that everything is fine for everyone else of their kind, when patently it is not. 39 Also, one has to remember the troupe of handmaids who make Ivanka's exceptional life possible. Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne? At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage.

At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage. In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park. As she says, gesturing to the skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue and the whole sprawl of the green park: \"Not a bad view to wake up to.\" 42 Sometimes, women of this kind-pampered, raised to be unthinking and self-involved-can change and end up doing incredible things. But it's rare. And under the thumb of Donald Trump, as an extension of My Father, it's almost unimaginable. Women-so many of whom are underpaid, undervalued, disregarded, and abused-shouldn't think that they can put their fate into the hands of someone who, no matter how hard she's worked in her father's company, has no clue of what struggle really means. The fact that Ivanka is supposedly guiding women's policy shows just how little-not how much-My Father cares about it. 43 Editor's note : An earlier version of this article described Ivana Trump and her parents as Croatian. In fact, they are Czech. The text has been corrected.

[T]here's just no way to measure the advantage I've gained from having the Trump name.... So rather than worrying about what other people think...my focus is to ensure that these successes continue for the next generation of Trumps. After all, we Trumps don't play to perceptions. We play to win. 1 Gosh, I sound like my father, don't I? But that's what you get from this particular Daddy's girl. 2 -Ivanka Trump, from The Trump Card: Playing to Win in Work and Life 3\n\nGosh, I sound like my father, don't I? But that's what you get from this particular Daddy's girl. 2 -Ivanka Trump, from The Trump Card: Playing to Win in Work and Life 3\n\n-Ivanka Trump, from The Trump Card: Playing to Win in Work and Life 3\n\nIvanka Trump is moving out of her Manhattan apartment to Washington, where, she has said, her biggest job will be to ease her three small children into their new lives, new schools, and new city. The rumor is that she will also serve as a surrogate first lady while Melania Trump stays in New York with her young son. Much as Michelle Obama was concerned with childhood obesity, Ivanka will pursue issues related to women and work, which also happens to be the subject of her forthcoming book, Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success . 4 No one forced Ivanka to uproot her life like this. She could have remained in New York and assumed the leadership of the Trump Organization along with her brothers Donald Jr. and Eric, while also continuing to work on her own clothing and accessories brand, IvankaTrump.com. Instead, she will leave both to follow her father. It's the kind of decision she has always made. After graduating from the Wharton School, as her father did, Ivanka decided to go into his business. She married another real-estate scion, a man who's the virtual double of her father, albeit with better hair. She joined the cast of The Apprentice , because her father ran that. Now, dutiful and unimaginative, Ivanka is following Donald to DC, which he also runs. Many presidential family members have ridden similar coattails throughout this nation's history, but not when attempting to embody the role of the independent working woman. 5 For three generations, the Trumps have been a family business. And, as is usual in a traditional family business, Ivanka's father will bring his son-in-law into the executive sphere rather than his daughter. Jared Kushner, now a senior White House adviser, is just the kind of man that Donald Trump can trust, respect, and rely on, because he's just like his father-in-law. Most important, Kushner is a man. In his official capacity, he'll be in charge of bringing peace to the Middle East, among more prosaic tasks like reaching out to the business community. Ivanka has no such official portfolio. 6 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols In other words, Trump has left Ivanka to take care of women's things, like her three little ones and possibly White House dinners, as well as... America's women. From her new house in Kalorama (no official office, no official desk), Ivanka will be unofficially consulting for her father while Dina Powell works as his new senior adviser on entrepreneurship, economic growth, and women's economic empowerment. Powell is a well-connected figure on the New York-Washington power axis who will be leaving her position at Goldman Sachs to join the administration. During the transition, she advised Ivanka. 7 Until now, Ivanka's main interest in women was in getting them to buy her handbags. Despite Powell's appointment, the Trump manipulation machine wants us to think that Ivanka is really his women's-rights representative. It also wants us to think that Ivanka, although a loyal tail-wagger for her father's right-wing train wreck, is somehow above it all-that she is forward-thinking (a former bestie of Chelsea Clinton! an art collector!), almost progressive, almost feminist, and profoundly not a forgotten woman... so not Rust Belt! But jobless and officeless in Washington, at home with the kids (supposedly), Ivanka looks more retro than progressive. In fact, she has hardly spoken a public word about any policy or program since her moderate speech at the Republican National Convention. There and ever since, her only job has been to burnish Trump's kinder, gentler side (if only he had one), to soften the Stephen Bannon blow, and to brand the new administration with a contemporary attitude toward women and women's rights, rather than the attitude of a pussy-grabbing sexual predator. 8 But (and here's the important thing): For all the talk of how Ivanka has her father's ear, on women's issues or any other... he doesn't listen to her . In interview after interview, she's been clear about how little interest Trump has in her opinion. \"Does he listen to you?\" one interviewer asked. \"Depends on the day,\" came her reply. 9 One day during the transition, for example, it was made to seem that Ivanka had a brief for climate change. She met with both Al Gore and the actor and environmental enthusiast Leonardo DiCaprio. But while Ivanka, and later her father, were chatting amicably with the former vice president, Trump's transition staff was putting together a list of well-known climate-change deniers and opponents of environmental regulation to populate his government. In any case, Ivanka has no record of interest in climate change, other than having co-hosted a single climate-friendly awards gala in New York in 2008. 10 Ivanka Trump looks on as My Father speaks at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, September 13, 2016. (Reuters /Mike Segar) Trump doesn't respect his daughter as a free agent and key adviser, a role that, of all the women around Trump, only former campaign manager Kellyanne Conway-now a White House counselor-seems to inhabit. Rather, Trump respects Ivanka because of her business acumen, learned from him; no doubt he respects her cojones, which are his cojones, and he probably appreciates her \"weaponized graciousness,\" as Emily Nussbaum termed it in The New Yorker . He also appreciates that her intelligence and ability and attractiveness and poise make him look good. Like any good narcissist, he respects her because she reflects him. In other words, Ivanka is a wholly owned subsidiary of \"My Father,\" as she almost religiously called him at the Republican convention. 11 * * * 12 Even the way in which Ivanka made her first stab at empowering women shows how far from progressive on these issues she and My Father really are. She didn't go state to state talking to women about what they need, or set up teams to do that; nor did she establish ties with representatives from women's groups around the country. (If she had, perhaps one of Trump's first executive orders would not have been to cut off funding to international groups that support abortion.) Instead, she asked the hyperconnected, super-ambitious socialite Wendi Deng, former wife of Rupert Murdoch, to host a power dinner at Deng's Fifth Avenue penthouse to discuss Ivanka's new brief. In attendance was Powell herself, still nominally with Goldman Sachs at the time; a number of corporate CEOs; the head of the Ford Foundation; Daily Beast founder Tina Brown; Nancy Gibbs, the editor of Time ; and the model Christy Turlington. Aside from being around the New York social circuit, Turlington had launched Every Mother Counts in 2011, a nonprofit that supports maternal health in the United States and which advocates internationally for safe birth practices. 13 This glitzy, high-profile branding of Ivanka's portfolio was intended to mask the fact that she's had little, or possibly no, experience dealing with the very difficult problems that lie ahead for women in America. Before the election, her main interest in women was getting them to buy her clothing, her handbags, and her shoes. Who can forget the ad that went up on the Internet the day after the convention to sell her little pale pink dress? \"Shop Ivanka's look from her #RNC speech,\" her brand tweeted the next day. 14 \"Everything you need is already inside you.\" -advice to working women from IvankaTrump.com Brand always wins out over substance with her (it's part of the business mentality), and when the substance is called into question, Ivanka retreats. For example, consider her pre-election interview with Cosmopolitan writer Prachi Gupta concerning the Trump campaign's proposal for maternity leave-a policy that Ivanka is supposed to have helped Conway develop to gain women's votes for My Father. The proposed leave gives government support to mothers for six weeks after their baby is born-if they can prove legal married status and don't have jobs that will already pay for it. Although the proposal's terms are unclear, it seems to exclude half of same-sex mothers (only a birth mother can receive the benefit), all unmarried mothers, all mothers of adopted infants, and certainly all fathers, whether in heterosexual or same-sex marriages. After questioning Ivanka about who the policy would leave out, Gupta cited My Father's 2004 statement that pregnancy was \"an inconvenience for a business\" and asked, \"Can you talk a little bit about those comments, and perhaps what has changed?\" 15 Ivanka's answer: \"So I think that you have a lot of negativity in these questions, and...I don't know how useful it is to spend too much time with you on this if you're going to make a comment like that.\" When Gupta defended the question-\"it is relevant a presidential candidate made those comments\"-Ivanka shot back, \"Well, you said he made those comments. I don't know that he said those comments,\" and ended the interview shortly thereafter. You can hear the echoes of My Father in those petulant and peremptory replies. 16 * * * 17 As a child, Ivanka was a total doll, an appendage and accessory for My Father. She was a golden, green-eyed, blond-haired thing, sweet-faced, alert, self-conscious, and, at 9 or 10 years old, already sexualized in a gold-lamé, lace-hemmed minidress, white pumps, gold jewelry, and a small, gold-chained gilt purse, her hair styled, her eyes watchful. In photos from the time, she always holds hands with My Father, more like a date than a daughter, while her mother Ivana trails them in the background (as Melania usually does today). 18 My Father could never keep his hands off Ivanka. In so many pictures of the two-as a child but especially as she begins to emerge into adulthood-Trump has his hands possessively on her waist or hips. Often, she's sitting coquettishly, Lolita-ishly, on his lap. In one much-viewed photograph, he's holding her there with his hands on her hips (she in a miniskirt, long legs aimed toward the camera), and she's cupping his chin as if he were her own dear love. To the side is a gilt statue of two large copulating birds. 19 Donald Trump with his daughter Ivanka at the Maybelline presents 1991 Look of the Year at Plaza Hotel in New York City, September 3, 1991. (Globe Photos/ZumaPress) Trump, of course, once told an interviewer that it would be OK to refer to his daughter as \"a piece of ass.\" In a later interview, he said: \"You know who's one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. My daughter, Ivanka. She's six feet tall. She's got the best body.\" When asked on The View whether Ivanka would ever pose for Playboy , Trump replied: \"I don't think Ivanka would do that inside the magazine. Although she does have a very nice figure. I've said that if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her.\" He can't stop talking about her body. 20 And yet, objectified as she certainly has been by this great big blustering objectifier of women, Ivanka has managed to pick up a lot of My Father's game. She's studied Trump and knows what he likes. He doesn't go for bookish girls, so when she went to Choate-one of the country's most exclusive prep schools-she also began working as a model (getting her first cover shoot, at age 15, for Seventeen ). After all, models and actresses are the women My Father marries. Then, after proving to him that she was marriageable, she went on to try to show that she could be him as well, by working at the Trump Organization. To be the Trump daughter, you must be a living contradiction in terms. You have to be a tough, rip-roaring negotiator and deal-closer like My Father, but you also have to be a sexy, leggy, fuckable babe who doesn't give much trouble. You have to be a Trump and a target for Trump. 21 In my hometown, the women who worked smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits. No matter how much Ivanka talks about what a great parent My Father was, Trump-more available to her than to any of his other children-was still not very present. He called a lot. And he took her calls; she brags about this. He provided special treats, vacations, presents. She certainly knew that to a large degree he held the reins of her inheritance. But My Father said flat out that he didn't like to care for children; men who change diapers, he's opined, are \"acting like the wife.\" The day-to-day rearing of Ivanka and her two brothers was done by four people: two Irish nannies and Ivana Trump's Czech parents, Milos and Maria. As Bill Maher once said about Trump's kids, they're like his real-estate projects: He doesn't build 'em, but he slaps his name on 'em. 22 What this set of paternal behaviors seems to have wrought in Ivanka's character is a woman who looks at herself and other women via the male gaze. She sees herself through My Father's eyes. Look at her: Of course she's pretty and young and has a great smile. But she's also ultrafeminized-a walking advertisement. She's beyond us, better than us, like a thoroughbred. She's a virtual Miss Universe runner-up, a created feminine figure-unreal, fixed, sculpted, and styled, done up and made up, invented as a female object. 23 * * * 24 Like any good Trump, Ivanka has erected an empire atop this act of self-creation, in her case at IvankaTrump.com, a retail-cum-inspirational website where \"Women Who Work\" is a prominent channel. The video that introduces \"Women Who Work\" is a multicultural collage of 25-to-35-year-old women who choose to work and are figuring out how to make their careers blend with starting a family and keeping the home together. Not one of the women pictured says, \"I don't want to have children,\" and not one is working at a typical industrial Rust Belt, lower-level office, or service-economy job-which is to say, the expected employment for most of the female American workforce. No one in this video says, \"I hate my boss.\" 25 Most of them seem to be their own bosses, or women who have started their own businesses. None of them are over 35, none are overweight; all are cisgendered. The Women Who Work are cookie- cutter, team-leader, go-getter gals, business-school graduates perhaps, all with good hair and makeup, nothing real or pained about them. There's no evidence that any of them have struggled. They all seem to be upper-middle-class, no matter their color or ethnic background. They're from a fantasy world in which every woman can get what she wants if only she works hard enough. 26 In another video, called \"Women Who Encourage,\" two reddish-haired women remove a clutch handbag from a gift box and then-one sitting and one standing, each in pink tops with black trousers, their coppery locks wafting-look tenderly at someone off to the right of the camera. This is how working women in Ivanka's virtual universe encourage each other: by offering things that are bought (preferably from IvankaTrump .com), rather than by leading a walkout at their place of employment, say, or by supporting one another when it comes to claims of sexual harassment. On Ivanka's website, conflict never exists. 27 IvankaTrump.com does have a section called \"Wise Words\" (\"Nothing is impossible. The word itself says 'I'm possible'\"-Audrey Hepburn; or \"It's never too late to be what you might have been,\" wrongly attributed to George Eliot; or \"Challenges are opportunities\"-so anodyne it's not attributed to anyone.) But you'll never read anything here about processing chickens or serving up burgers or sewing jeans, or what it's like to be a secretary, a receptionist, a nurse, a hairdresser, a teacher, a saleswoman, a waitress, a bookkeeper, a cashier, or any of the other jobs at which most American women work. 28 IvankaTrump.com prefers to address style and fashion, what you can buy for work and what you should wear to work, rather than the substance of work. It includes tips on how to get promoted and tips for thinking like a Harvard Business School graduate; it includes pages about yoga for the workday, as well as about entertaining and lifestyle and exercise and what to eat and what to serve. So far, wages, discrimination, and sexual harassment have not been on the radar, not even in a Lean In -lite kind of way. That's not the purpose of the website. It should be hashtagged #womenwhobuy. 29 This is what's known today as \"femvertising.\" The best thing one can say about Ivanka's retail celebration of women is that all of the women in her ads are portrayed as doing things for other women-the campaign is positively sapphic. Like all femvertising, IvankaTrump.com soft-pedals harsh realities; everything for working women comes wrapped in the gauze of love and encouragement and uplift and cool, calm niceness. Nothing on her site has to do with women's empowerment, because empowerment is political, and the politics of female empowerment must naturally take on the bastions of male power, which Ivanka isn't likely to do. Before the election, \"Women Who Work\" was part of her branding scheme, but now it's been retooled as a political scheme for her father's administration. The scheme should be beneficial both to the administration and to the brand, but not necessarily to women who actually work. 30 * * * 31 Anyway, silly me: I thought women who worked looked like Roseanne Barr, whose late-1980s sitcom embodied all the working women I knew growing up. Roseanne's eponymous character worked in a plastics factory, was often unemployed, took a fast-food job, was a telemarketer and later a bartender, and at some point-a low point-worked as a hair sweeper at a beauty salon. And, of course, she was a waitress. This is what life was like for the working women where I grew up, in sooty New Jersey, and also, apparently, in Barr's own Salt Lake City. (It turns out that the real Roseanne Barr, who ran for president in 2012, is now a slimmed-down, styled-up, face-fixed, and committed Hillary Clinton-hater-but I'm talking about the TV character, not the woman.) And if they didn't look like Roseanne, they were pert, exhausted office workers like Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Richards: put-upon, condescended to, and belittled by their boss and male co-workers. 32 In my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs. They didn't wear slim linen trousers and strappy heels and boxy pale cashmere V-necks to work, and they still don't. They wore stretch slacks and polyester blouses. They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?). And because so many women have to some degree internalized this oppressed version of self, Ivanka can seem like a role model. She is the working woman that the working women I knew in my youth may have dreamed they'd become when they first started to work. They thought perhaps they'd make enough money to have hair like that, teeth like that. Enough money, in other words, to be free of the grinding work they had to do just to get by. 36 * * * 37 So we gaze at the lovely Ivanka. How can we help it? She is an object of fascination. She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women. One of the things My Father has said about her illustrates precisely why Ivanka won't help women as a supposed presidential influencer. When asked, in the wake of the Roger Ailes scandal, how he'd feel if Ivanka were harassed at work, Trump replied that she would never allow that to happen: If a boss were foolish enough to bother her, she'd just go out and get a new job. 38 Because Ivanka Trump can do that. The rest of us can't. Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee of the 1970s-the one exceptional person who is hired and then used to prove that everything is fine for everyone else of their kind, when patently it is not. 39 Also, one has to remember the troupe of handmaids who make Ivanka's exceptional life possible. Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne? At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage. In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park. As she says, gesturing to the skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue and the whole sprawl of the green park: \"Not a bad view to wake up to.\" 42 Sometimes, women of this kind-pampered, raised to be unthinking and self-involved-can change and end up doing incredible things. But it's rare. And under the thumb of Donald Trump, as an extension of My Father, it's almost unimaginable. Women-so many of whom are underpaid, undervalued, disregarded, and abused-shouldn't think that they can put their fate into the hands of someone who, no matter how hard she's worked in her father's company, has no clue of what struggle really means. The fact that Ivanka is supposedly guiding women's policy shows just how little-not how much-My Father cares about it. 43 Editor's note : An earlier version of this article described Ivana Trump and her parents as Croatian. In fact, they are Czech. The text has been corrected. Listen to Amy Wilentz discuss Ivanka on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\nNo one forced Ivanka to uproot her life like this. She could have remained in New York and assumed the leadership of the Trump Organization along with her brothers Donald Jr. and Eric, while also continuing to work on her own clothing and accessories brand, IvankaTrump.com. Instead, she will leave both to follow her father. It's the kind of decision she has always made. After graduating from the Wharton School, as her father did, Ivanka decided to go into his business. She married another real-estate scion, a man who's the virtual double of her father, albeit with better hair. She joined the cast of The Apprentice , because her father ran that. Now, dutiful and unimaginative, Ivanka is following Donald to DC, which he also runs. Many presidential family members have ridden similar coattails throughout this nation's history, but not when attempting to embody the role of the independent working woman. 5 For three generations, the Trumps have been a family business. And, as is usual in a traditional family business, Ivanka's father will bring his son-in-law into the executive sphere rather than his daughter. Jared Kushner, now a senior White House adviser, is just the kind of man that Donald Trump can trust, respect, and rely on, because he's just like his father-in-law. Most important, Kushner is a man. In his official capacity, he'll be in charge of bringing peace to the Middle East, among more prosaic tasks like reaching out to the business community. Ivanka has no such official portfolio. 6 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols In other words, Trump has left Ivanka to take care of women's things, like her three little ones and possibly White House dinners, as well as... America's women. From her new house in Kalorama (no official office, no official desk), Ivanka will be unofficially consulting for her father while Dina Powell works as his new senior adviser on entrepreneurship, economic growth, and women's economic empowerment. Powell is a well-connected figure on the New York-Washington power axis who will be leaving her position at Goldman Sachs to join the administration. During the transition, she advised Ivanka. 7 Until now, Ivanka's main interest in women was in getting them to buy her handbags. Despite Powell's appointment, the Trump manipulation machine wants us to think that Ivanka is really his women's-rights representative. It also wants us to think that Ivanka, although a loyal tail-wagger for her father's right-wing train wreck, is somehow above it all-that she is forward-thinking (a former bestie of Chelsea Clinton! an art collector!), almost progressive, almost feminist, and profoundly not a forgotten woman... so not Rust Belt! But jobless and officeless in Washington, at home with the kids (supposedly), Ivanka looks more retro than progressive. In fact, she has hardly spoken a public word about any policy or program since her moderate speech at the Republican National Convention. There and ever since, her only job has been to burnish Trump's kinder, gentler side (if only he had one), to soften the Stephen Bannon blow, and to brand the new administration with a contemporary attitude toward women and women's rights, rather than the attitude of a pussy-grabbing sexual predator. 8 But (and here's the important thing): For all the talk of how Ivanka has her father's ear, on women's issues or any other... he doesn't listen to her . In interview after interview, she's been clear about how little interest Trump has in her opinion. \"Does he listen to you?\" one interviewer asked. \"Depends on the day,\" came her reply. 9 One day during the transition, for example, it was made to seem that Ivanka had a brief for climate change. She met with both Al Gore and the actor and environmental enthusiast Leonardo DiCaprio. But while Ivanka, and later her father, were chatting amicably with the former vice president, Trump's transition staff was putting together a list of well-known climate-change deniers and opponents of environmental regulation to populate his government. In any case, Ivanka has no record of interest in climate change, other than having co-hosted a single climate-friendly awards gala in New York in 2008. 10 Ivanka Trump looks on as My Father speaks at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, September 13, 2016. (Reuters /Mike Segar) Trump doesn't respect his daughter as a free agent and key adviser, a role that, of all the women around Trump, only former campaign manager Kellyanne Conway-now a White House counselor-seems to inhabit. Rather, Trump respects Ivanka because of her business acumen, learned from him; no doubt he respects her cojones, which are his cojones, and he probably appreciates her \"weaponized graciousness,\" as Emily Nussbaum termed it in The New Yorker . He also appreciates that her intelligence and ability and attractiveness and poise make him look good. Like any good narcissist, he respects her because she reflects him. In other words, Ivanka is a wholly owned subsidiary of \"My Father,\" as she almost religiously called him at the Republican convention. 11 * * * 12 Even the way in which Ivanka made her first stab at empowering women shows how far from progressive on these issues she and My Father really are. She didn't go state to state talking to women about what they need, or set up teams to do that; nor did she establish ties with representatives from women's groups around the country. (If she had, perhaps one of Trump's first executive orders would not have been to cut off funding to international groups that support abortion.) Instead, she asked the hyperconnected, super-ambitious socialite Wendi Deng, former wife of Rupert Murdoch, to host a power dinner at Deng's Fifth Avenue penthouse to discuss Ivanka's new brief. In attendance was Powell herself, still nominally with Goldman Sachs at the time; a number of corporate CEOs; the head of the Ford Foundation; Daily Beast founder Tina Brown; Nancy Gibbs, the editor of Time ; and the model Christy Turlington. Aside from being around the New York social circuit, Turlington had launched Every Mother Counts in 2011, a nonprofit that supports maternal health in the United States and which advocates internationally for safe birth practices. 13 This glitzy, high-profile branding of Ivanka's portfolio was intended to mask the fact that she's had little, or possibly no, experience dealing with the very difficult problems that lie ahead for women in America. Before the election, her main interest in women was getting them to buy her clothing, her handbags, and her shoes. Who can forget the ad that went up on the Internet the day after the convention to sell her little pale pink dress? \"Shop Ivanka's look from her #RNC speech,\" her brand tweeted the next day. 14 \"Everything you need is already inside you.\" -advice to working women from IvankaTrump.com Brand always wins out over substance with her (it's part of the business mentality), and when the substance is called into question, Ivanka retreats. For example, consider her pre-election interview with Cosmopolitan writer Prachi Gupta concerning the Trump campaign's proposal for maternity leave-a policy that Ivanka is supposed to have helped Conway develop to gain women's votes for My Father. The proposed leave gives government support to mothers for six weeks after their baby is born-if they can prove legal married status and don't have jobs that will already pay for it. Although the proposal's terms are unclear, it seems to exclude half of same-sex mothers (only a birth mother can receive the benefit), all unmarried mothers, all mothers of adopted infants, and certainly all fathers, whether in heterosexual or same-sex marriages. After questioning Ivanka about who the policy would leave out, Gupta cited My Father's 2004 statement that pregnancy was \"an inconvenience for a business\" and asked, \"Can you talk a little bit about those comments, and perhaps what has changed?\" 15 Ivanka's answer: \"So I think that you have a lot of negativity in these questions, and...I don't know how useful it is to spend too much time with you on this if you're going to make a comment like that.\" When Gupta defended the question-\"it is relevant a presidential candidate made those comments\"-Ivanka shot back, \"Well, you said he made those comments. I don't know that he said those comments,\" and ended the interview shortly thereafter. You can hear the echoes of My Father in those petulant and peremptory replies. 16 * * * 17 As a child, Ivanka was a total doll, an appendage and accessory for My Father. She was a golden, green-eyed, blond-haired thing, sweet-faced, alert, self-conscious, and, at 9 or 10 years old, already sexualized in a gold-lamé, lace-hemmed minidress, white pumps, gold jewelry, and a small, gold-chained gilt purse, her hair styled, her eyes watchful. In photos from the time, she always holds hands with My Father, more like a date than a daughter, while her mother Ivana trails them in the background (as Melania usually does today). 18 My Father could never keep his hands off Ivanka. In so many pictures of the two-as a child but especially as she begins to emerge into adulthood-Trump has his hands possessively on her waist or hips. Often, she's sitting coquettishly, Lolita-ishly, on his lap. In one much-viewed photograph, he's holding her there with his hands on her hips (she in a miniskirt, long legs aimed toward the camera), and she's cupping his chin as if he were her own dear love. To the side is a gilt statue of two large copulating birds. 19 Donald Trump with his daughter Ivanka at the Maybelline presents 1991 Look of the Year at Plaza Hotel in New York City, September 3, 1991. (Globe Photos/ZumaPress) Trump, of course, once told an interviewer that it would be OK to refer to his daughter as \"a piece of ass.\" In a later interview, he said: \"You know who's one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. My daughter, Ivanka. She's six feet tall. She's got the best body.\" When asked on The View whether Ivanka would ever pose for Playboy , Trump replied: \"I don't think Ivanka would do that inside the magazine. Although she does have a very nice figure. I've said that if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her.\" He can't stop talking about her body. 20 And yet, objectified as she certainly has been by this great big blustering objectifier of women, Ivanka has managed to pick up a lot of My Father's game. She's studied Trump and knows what he likes. He doesn't go for bookish girls, so when she went to Choate-one of the country's most exclusive prep schools-she also began working as a model (getting her first cover shoot, at age 15, for Seventeen ). After all, models and actresses are the women My Father marries. Then, after proving to him that she was marriageable, she went on to try to show that she could be him as well, by working at the Trump Organization. To be the Trump daughter, you must be a living contradiction in terms. You have to be a tough, rip-roaring negotiator and deal-closer like My Father, but you also have to be a sexy, leggy, fuckable babe who doesn't give much trouble. You have to be a Trump and a target for Trump. 21 In my hometown, the women who worked smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits. No matter how much Ivanka talks about what a great parent My Father was, Trump-more available to her than to any of his other children-was still not very present. He called a lot. And he took her calls; she brags about this. He provided special treats, vacations, presents. She certainly knew that to a large degree he held the reins of her inheritance. But My Father said flat out that he didn't like to care for children; men who change diapers, he's opined, are \"acting like the wife.\" The day-to-day rearing of Ivanka and her two brothers was done by four people: two Irish nannies and Ivana Trump's Czech parents, Milos and Maria. As Bill Maher once said about Trump's kids, they're like his real-estate projects: He doesn't build 'em, but he slaps his name on 'em. 22 What this set of paternal behaviors seems to have wrought in Ivanka's character is a woman who looks at herself and other women via the male gaze. She sees herself through My Father's eyes. Look at her: Of course she's pretty and young and has a great smile. But she's also ultrafeminized-a walking advertisement. She's beyond us, better than us, like a thoroughbred. She's a virtual Miss Universe runner-up, a created feminine figure-unreal, fixed, sculpted, and styled, done up and made up, invented as a female object. 23 * * * 24 Like any good Trump, Ivanka has erected an empire atop this act of self-creation, in her case at IvankaTrump.com, a retail-cum-inspirational website where \"Women Who Work\" is a prominent channel. The video that introduces \"Women Who Work\" is a multicultural collage of 25-to-35-year-old women who choose to work and are figuring out how to make their careers blend with starting a family and keeping the home together. Not one of the women pictured says, \"I don't want to have children,\" and not one is working at a typical industrial Rust Belt, lower-level office, or service-economy job-which is to say, the expected employment for most of the female American workforce. No one in this video says, \"I hate my boss.\" 25 Most of them seem to be their own bosses, or women who have started their own businesses. None of them are over 35, none are overweight; all are cisgendered. The Women Who Work are cookie- cutter, team-leader, go-getter gals, business-school graduates perhaps, all with good hair and makeup, nothing real or pained about them. There's no evidence that any of them have struggled. They all seem to be upper-middle-class, no matter their color or ethnic background. They're from a fantasy world in which every woman can get what she wants if only she works hard enough. 26 In another video, called \"Women Who Encourage,\" two reddish-haired women remove a clutch handbag from a gift box and then-one sitting and one standing, each in pink tops with black trousers, their coppery locks wafting-look tenderly at someone off to the right of the camera. This is how working women in Ivanka's virtual universe encourage each other: by offering things that are bought (preferably from IvankaTrump .com), rather than by leading a walkout at their place of employment, say, or by supporting one another when it comes to claims of sexual harassment. On Ivanka's website, conflict never exists. 27 IvankaTrump.com does have a section called \"Wise Words\" (\"Nothing is impossible. The word itself says 'I'm possible'\"-Audrey Hepburn; or \"It's never too late to be what you might have been,\" wrongly attributed to George Eliot; or \"Challenges are opportunities\"-so anodyne it's not attributed to anyone.) But you'll never read anything here about processing chickens or serving up burgers or sewing jeans, or what it's like to be a secretary, a receptionist, a nurse, a hairdresser, a teacher, a saleswoman, a waitress, a bookkeeper, a cashier, or any of the other jobs at which most American women work. 28 IvankaTrump.com prefers to address style and fashion, what you can buy for work and what you should wear to work, rather than the substance of work. It includes tips on how to get promoted and tips for thinking like a Harvard Business School graduate; it includes pages about yoga for the workday, as well as about entertaining and lifestyle and exercise and what to eat and what to serve. So far, wages, discrimination, and sexual harassment have not been on the radar, not even in a Lean In -lite kind of way. That's not the purpose of the website. It should be hashtagged #womenwhobuy. 29 This is what's known today as \"femvertising.\" The best thing one can say about Ivanka's retail celebration of women is that all of the women in her ads are portrayed as doing things for other women-the campaign is positively sapphic. Like all femvertising, IvankaTrump.com soft-pedals harsh realities; everything for working women comes wrapped in the gauze of love and encouragement and uplift and cool, calm niceness. Nothing on her site has to do with women's empowerment, because empowerment is political, and the politics of female empowerment must naturally take on the bastions of male power, which Ivanka isn't likely to do. Before the election, \"Women Who Work\" was part of her branding scheme, but now it's been retooled as a political scheme for her father's administration. The scheme should be beneficial both to the administration and to the brand, but not necessarily to women who actually work. 30 * * * 31 Anyway, silly me: I thought women who worked looked like Roseanne Barr, whose late-1980s sitcom embodied all the working women I knew growing up. Roseanne's eponymous character worked in a plastics factory, was often unemployed, took a fast-food job, was a telemarketer and later a bartender, and at some point-a low point-worked as a hair sweeper at a beauty salon. And, of course, she was a waitress. This is what life was like for the working women where I grew up, in sooty New Jersey, and also, apparently, in Barr's own Salt Lake City. (It turns out that the real Roseanne Barr, who ran for president in 2012, is now a slimmed-down, styled-up, face-fixed, and committed Hillary Clinton-hater-but I'm talking about the TV character, not the woman.) And if they didn't look like Roseanne, they were pert, exhausted office workers like Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Richards: put-upon, condescended to, and belittled by their boss and male co-workers. 32 In my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs. They didn't wear slim linen trousers and strappy heels and boxy pale cashmere V-necks to work, and they still don't. They wore stretch slacks and polyester blouses. They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband.

She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women. One of the things My Father has said about her illustrates precisely why Ivanka won't help women as a supposed presidential influencer. When asked, in the wake of the Roger Ailes scandal, how he'd feel if Ivanka were harassed at work, Trump replied that she would never allow that to happen: If a boss were foolish enough to bother her, she'd just go out and get a new job. 38 Because Ivanka Trump can do that.

Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne? At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage. In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park.

Ivanka has no such official portfolio. 6 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols In other words, Trump has left Ivanka to take care of women's things, like her three little ones and possibly White House dinners, as well as... America's women. From her new house in Kalorama (no official office, no official desk), Ivanka will be unofficially consulting for her father while Dina Powell works as his new senior adviser on entrepreneurship, economic growth, and women's economic empowerment. Powell is a well-connected figure on the New York-Washington power axis who will be leaving her position at Goldman Sachs to join the administration. During the transition, she advised Ivanka. 7 Until now, Ivanka's main interest in women was in getting them to buy her handbags. Despite Powell's appointment, the Trump manipulation machine wants us to think that Ivanka is really his women's-rights representative. It also wants us to think that Ivanka, although a loyal tail-wagger for her father's right-wing train wreck, is somehow above it all-that she is forward-thinking (a former bestie of Chelsea Clinton! an art collector!), almost progressive, almost feminist, and profoundly not a forgotten woman... so not Rust Belt! But jobless and officeless in Washington, at home with the kids (supposedly), Ivanka looks more retro than progressive. In fact, she has hardly spoken a public word about any policy or program since her moderate speech at the Republican National Convention. There and ever since, her only job has been to burnish Trump's kinder, gentler side (if only he had one), to soften the Stephen Bannon blow, and to brand the new administration with a contemporary attitude toward women and women's rights, rather than the attitude of a pussy-grabbing sexual predator. 8 But (and here's the important thing): For all the talk of how Ivanka has her father's ear, on women's issues or any other... he doesn't listen to her . In interview after interview, she's been clear about how little interest Trump has in her opinion. \"Does he listen to you?\" one interviewer asked. \"Depends on the day,\" came her reply. 9 One day during the transition, for example, it was made to seem that Ivanka had a brief for climate change. She met with both Al Gore and the actor and environmental enthusiast Leonardo DiCaprio. But while Ivanka, and later her father, were chatting amicably with the former vice president, Trump's transition staff was putting together a list of well-known climate-change deniers and opponents of environmental regulation to populate his government. In any case, Ivanka has no record of interest in climate change, other than having co-hosted a single climate-friendly awards gala in New York in 2008. 10 Ivanka Trump looks on as My Father speaks at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, September 13, 2016. (Reuters /Mike Segar) Trump doesn't respect his daughter as a free agent and key adviser, a role that, of all the women around Trump, only former campaign manager Kellyanne Conway-now a White House counselor-seems to inhabit. Rather, Trump respects Ivanka because of her business acumen, learned from him; no doubt he respects her cojones, which are his cojones, and he probably appreciates her \"weaponized graciousness,\" as Emily Nussbaum termed it in The New Yorker . He also appreciates that her intelligence and ability and attractiveness and poise make him look good. Like any good narcissist, he respects her because she reflects him. In other words, Ivanka is a wholly owned subsidiary of \"My Father,\" as she almost religiously called him at the Republican convention. 11 * * * 12 Even the way in which Ivanka made her first stab at empowering women shows how far from progressive on these issues she and My Father really are. She didn't go state to state talking to women about what they need, or set up teams to do that; nor did she establish ties with representatives from women's groups around the country. (If she had, perhaps one of Trump's first executive orders would not have been to cut off funding to international groups that support abortion.) Instead, she asked the hyperconnected, super-ambitious socialite Wendi Deng, former wife of Rupert Murdoch, to host a power dinner at Deng's Fifth Avenue penthouse to discuss Ivanka's new brief. In attendance was Powell herself, still nominally with Goldman Sachs at the time; a number of corporate CEOs; the head of the Ford Foundation; Daily Beast founder Tina Brown; Nancy Gibbs, the editor of Time ; and the model Christy Turlington. Aside from being around the New York social circuit, Turlington had launched Every Mother Counts in 2011, a nonprofit that supports maternal health in the United States and which advocates internationally for safe birth practices. 13 This glitzy, high-profile branding of Ivanka's portfolio was intended to mask the fact that she's had little, or possibly no, experience dealing with the very difficult problems that lie ahead for women in America. Before the election, her main interest in women was getting them to buy her clothing, her handbags, and her shoes. Who can forget the ad that went up on the Internet the day after the convention to sell her little pale pink dress? \"Shop Ivanka's look from her #RNC speech,\" her brand tweeted the next day. 14 \"Everything you need is already inside you.\" -advice to working women from IvankaTrump.com Brand always wins out over substance with her (it's part of the business mentality), and when the substance is called into question, Ivanka retreats. For example, consider her pre-election interview with Cosmopolitan writer Prachi Gupta concerning the Trump campaign's proposal for maternity leave-a policy that Ivanka is supposed to have helped Conway develop to gain women's votes for My Father. The proposed leave gives government support to mothers for six weeks after their baby is born-if they can prove legal married status and don't have jobs that will already pay for it. Although the proposal's terms are unclear, it seems to exclude half of same-sex mothers (only a birth mother can receive the benefit), all unmarried mothers, all mothers of adopted infants, and certainly all fathers, whether in heterosexual or same-sex marriages. After questioning Ivanka about who the policy would leave out, Gupta cited My Father's 2004 statement that pregnancy was \"an inconvenience for a business\" and asked, \"Can you talk a little bit about those comments, and perhaps what has changed?\" 15 Ivanka's answer: \"So I think that you have a lot of negativity in these questions, and...I don't know how useful it is to spend too much time with you on this if you're going to make a comment like that.\" When Gupta defended the question-\"it is relevant a presidential candidate made those comments\"-Ivanka shot back, \"Well, you said he made those comments. I don't know that he said those comments,\" and ended the interview shortly thereafter. You can hear the echoes of My Father in those petulant and peremptory replies. 16 * * * 17 As a child, Ivanka was a total doll, an appendage and accessory for My Father. She was a golden, green-eyed, blond-haired thing, sweet-faced, alert, self-conscious, and, at 9 or 10 years old, already sexualized in a gold-lamé, lace-hemmed minidress, white pumps, gold jewelry, and a small, gold-chained gilt purse, her hair styled, her eyes watchful. In photos from the time, she always holds hands with My Father, more like a date than a daughter, while her mother Ivana trails them in the background (as Melania usually does today). 18 My Father could never keep his hands off Ivanka. In so many pictures of the two-as a child but especially as she begins to emerge into adulthood-Trump has his hands possessively on her waist or hips. Often, she's sitting coquettishly, Lolita-ishly, on his lap. In one much-viewed photograph, he's holding her there with his hands on her hips (she in a miniskirt, long legs aimed toward the camera), and she's cupping his chin as if he were her own dear love. To the side is a gilt statue of two large copulating birds. 19 Donald Trump with his daughter Ivanka at the Maybelline presents 1991 Look of the Year at Plaza Hotel in New York City, September 3, 1991. (Globe Photos/ZumaPress) Trump, of course, once told an interviewer that it would be OK to refer to his daughter as \"a piece of ass.\" In a later interview, he said: \"You know who's one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. My daughter, Ivanka. She's six feet tall. She's got the best body.\" When asked on The View whether Ivanka would ever pose for Playboy , Trump replied: \"I don't think Ivanka would do that inside the magazine. Although she does have a very nice figure. I've said that if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her.\" He can't stop talking about her body. 20 And yet, objectified as she certainly has been by this great big blustering objectifier of women, Ivanka has managed to pick up a lot of My Father's game. She's studied Trump and knows what he likes. He doesn't go for bookish girls, so when she went to Choate-one of the country's most exclusive prep schools-she also began working as a model (getting her first cover shoot, at age 15, for Seventeen ). After all, models and actresses are the women My Father marries. Then, after proving to him that she was marriageable, she went on to try to show that she could be him as well, by working at the Trump Organization. To be the Trump daughter, you must be a living contradiction in terms. You have to be a tough, rip-roaring negotiator and deal-closer like My Father, but you also have to be a sexy, leggy, fuckable babe who doesn't give much trouble. You have to be a Trump and a target for Trump. 21 In my hometown, the women who worked smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits. No matter how much Ivanka talks about what a great parent My Father was, Trump-more available to her than to any of his other children-was still not very present. He called a lot. And he took her calls; she brags about this. He provided special treats, vacations, presents. She certainly knew that to a large degree he held the reins of her inheritance. But My Father said flat out that he didn't like to care for children; men who change diapers, he's opined, are \"acting like the wife.\" The day-to-day rearing of Ivanka and her two brothers was done by four people: two Irish nannies and Ivana Trump's Czech parents, Milos and Maria. As Bill Maher once said about Trump's kids, they're like his real-estate projects: He doesn't build 'em, but he slaps his name on 'em. 22 What this set of paternal behaviors seems to have wrought in Ivanka's character is a woman who looks at herself and other women via the male gaze. She sees herself through My Father's eyes. Look at her: Of course she's pretty and young and has a great smile. But she's also ultrafeminized-a walking advertisement. She's beyond us, better than us, like a thoroughbred. She's a virtual Miss Universe runner-up, a created feminine figure-unreal, fixed, sculpted, and styled, done up and made up, invented as a female object. 23 * * * 24 Like any good Trump, Ivanka has erected an empire atop this act of self-creation, in her case at IvankaTrump.com, a retail-cum-inspirational website where \"Women Who Work\" is a prominent channel. The video that introduces \"Women Who Work\" is a multicultural collage of 25-to-35-year-old women who choose to work and are figuring out how to make their careers blend with starting a family and keeping the home together. Not one of the women pictured says, \"I don't want to have children,\" and not one is working at a typical industrial Rust Belt, lower-level office, or service-economy job-which is to say, the expected employment for most of the female American workforce. No one in this video says, \"I hate my boss.\" 25 Most of them seem to be their own bosses, or women who have started their own businesses. None of them are over 35, none are overweight; all are cisgendered. The Women Who Work are cookie- cutter, team-leader, go-getter gals, business-school graduates perhaps, all with good hair and makeup, nothing real or pained about them. There's no evidence that any of them have struggled. They all seem to be upper-middle-class, no matter their color or ethnic background. They're from a fantasy world in which every woman can get what she wants if only she works hard enough. 26 In another video, called \"Women Who Encourage,\" two reddish-haired women remove a clutch handbag from a gift box and then-one sitting and one standing, each in pink tops with black trousers, their coppery locks wafting-look tenderly at someone off to the right of the camera. This is how working women in Ivanka's virtual universe encourage each other: by offering things that are bought (preferably from IvankaTrump .com), rather than by leading a walkout at their place of employment, say, or by supporting one another when it comes to claims of sexual harassment. On Ivanka's website, conflict never exists. 27 IvankaTrump.com does have a section called \"Wise Words\" (\"Nothing is impossible. The word itself says 'I'm possible'\"-Audrey Hepburn; or \"It's never too late to be what you might have been,\" wrongly attributed to George Eliot; or \"Challenges are opportunities\"-so anodyne it's not attributed to anyone.) But you'll never read anything here about processing chickens or serving up burgers or sewing jeans, or what it's like to be a secretary, a receptionist, a nurse, a hairdresser, a teacher, a saleswoman, a waitress, a bookkeeper, a cashier, or any of the other jobs at which most American women work. 28 IvankaTrump.com prefers to address style and fashion, what you can buy for work and what you should wear to work, rather than the substance of work. It includes tips on how to get promoted and tips for thinking like a Harvard Business School graduate; it includes pages about yoga for the workday, as well as about entertaining and lifestyle and exercise and what to eat and what to serve. So far, wages, discrimination, and sexual harassment have not been on the radar, not even in a Lean In -lite kind of way. That's not the purpose of the website. It should be hashtagged #womenwhobuy. 29 This is what's known today as \"femvertising.\" The best thing one can say about Ivanka's retail celebration of women is that all of the women in her ads are portrayed as doing things for other women-the campaign is positively sapphic. Like all femvertising, IvankaTrump.com soft-pedals harsh realities; everything for working women comes wrapped in the gauze of love and encouragement and uplift and cool, calm niceness. Nothing on her site has to do with women's empowerment, because empowerment is political, and the politics of female empowerment must naturally take on the bastions of male power, which Ivanka isn't likely to do. Before the election, \"Women Who Work\" was part of her branding scheme, but now it's been retooled as a political scheme for her father's administration. The scheme should be beneficial both to the administration and to the brand, but not necessarily to women who actually work. 30 * * * 31 Anyway, silly me: I thought women who worked looked like Roseanne Barr, whose late-1980s sitcom embodied all the working women I knew growing up. Roseanne's eponymous character worked in a plastics factory, was often unemployed, took a fast-food job, was a telemarketer and later a bartender, and at some point-a low point-worked as a hair sweeper at a beauty salon. And, of course, she was a waitress. This is what life was like for the working women where I grew up, in sooty New Jersey, and also, apparently, in Barr's own Salt Lake City. (It turns out that the real Roseanne Barr, who ran for president in 2012, is now a slimmed-down, styled-up, face-fixed, and committed Hillary Clinton-hater-but I'm talking about the TV character, not the woman.) And if they didn't look like Roseanne, they were pert, exhausted office workers like Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Richards: put-upon, condescended to, and belittled by their boss and male co-workers. 32 In my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs. They didn't wear slim linen trousers and strappy heels and boxy pale cashmere V-necks to work, and they still don't. They wore stretch slacks and polyester blouses. They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?). And because so many women have to some degree internalized this oppressed version of self, Ivanka can seem like a role model. She is the working woman that the working women I knew in my youth may have dreamed they'd become when they first started to work. They thought perhaps they'd make enough money to have hair like that, teeth like that. Enough money, in other words, to be free of the grinding work they had to do just to get by. 36 * * * 37 So we gaze at the lovely Ivanka. How can we help it? She is an object of fascination. She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women. One of the things My Father has said about her illustrates precisely why Ivanka won't help women as a supposed presidential influencer. When asked, in the wake of the Roger Ailes scandal, how he'd feel if Ivanka were harassed at work, Trump replied that she would never allow that to happen: If a boss were foolish enough to bother her, she'd just go out and get a new job. 38 Because Ivanka Trump can do that. The rest of us can't. Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee of the 1970s-the one exceptional person who is hired and then used to prove that everything is fine for everyone else of their kind, when patently it is not. 39 Also, one has to remember the troupe of handmaids who make Ivanka's exceptional life possible. Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne? At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage. In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park. As she says, gesturing to the skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue and the whole sprawl of the green park: \"Not a bad view to wake up to.\" 42 Sometimes, women of this kind-pampered, raised to be unthinking and self-involved-can change and end up doing incredible things. But it's rare. And under the thumb of Donald Trump, as an extension of My Father, it's almost unimaginable. Women-so many of whom are underpaid, undervalued, disregarded, and abused-shouldn't think that they can put their fate into the hands of someone who, no matter how hard she's worked in her father's company, has no clue of what struggle really means. The fact that Ivanka is supposedly guiding women's policy shows just how little-not how much-My Father cares about it. 43 Editor's note : An earlier version of this article described Ivana Trump and her parents as Croatian. In fact, they are Czech. The text has been corrected.

You have to be a tough, rip-roaring negotiator and deal-closer like My Father, but you also have to be a sexy, leggy, fuckable babe who doesn't give much trouble. You have to be a Trump and a target for Trump. 21 In my hometown, the women who worked smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits. No matter how much Ivanka talks about what a great parent My Father was, Trump-more available to her than to any of his other children-was still not very present. He called a lot. And he took her calls; she brags about this. He provided special treats, vacations, presents. She certainly knew that to a large degree he held the reins of her inheritance. But My Father said flat out that he didn't like to care for children; men who change diapers, he's opined, are \"acting like the wife.\" The day-to-day rearing of Ivanka and her two brothers was done by four people: two Irish nannies and Ivana Trump's Czech parents, Milos and Maria. As Bill Maher once said about Trump's kids, they're like his real-estate projects: He doesn't build 'em, but he slaps his name on 'em. 22 What this set of paternal behaviors seems to have wrought in Ivanka's character is a woman who looks at herself and other women via the male gaze. She sees herself through My Father's eyes. Look at her: Of course she's pretty and young and has a great smile. But she's also ultrafeminized-a walking advertisement. She's beyond us, better than us, like a thoroughbred. She's a virtual Miss Universe runner-up, a created feminine figure-unreal, fixed, sculpted, and styled, done up and made up, invented as a female object. 23 * * * 24 Like any good Trump, Ivanka has erected an empire atop this act of self-creation, in her case at IvankaTrump.com, a retail-cum-inspirational website where \"Women Who Work\" is a prominent channel. The video that introduces \"Women Who Work\" is a multicultural collage of 25-to-35-year-old women who choose to work and are figuring out how to make their careers blend with starting a family and keeping the home together. Not one of the women pictured says, \"I don't want to have children,\" and not one is working at a typical industrial Rust Belt, lower-level office, or service-economy job-which is to say, the expected employment for most of the female American workforce. No one in this video says, \"I hate my boss.\" 25 Most of them seem to be their own bosses, or women who have started their own businesses. None of them are over 35, none are overweight; all are cisgendered. The Women Who Work are cookie- cutter, team-leader, go-getter gals, business-school graduates perhaps, all with good hair and makeup, nothing real or pained about them. There's no evidence that any of them have struggled. They all seem to be upper-middle-class, no matter their color or ethnic background. They're from a fantasy world in which every woman can get what she wants if only she works hard enough. 26 In another video, called \"Women Who Encourage,\" two reddish-haired women remove a clutch handbag from a gift box and then-one sitting and one standing, each in pink tops with black trousers, their coppery locks wafting-look tenderly at someone off to the right of the camera. This is how working women in Ivanka's virtual universe encourage each other: by offering things that are bought (preferably from IvankaTrump .com), rather than by leading a walkout at their place of employment, say, or by supporting one another when it comes to claims of sexual harassment. On Ivanka's website, conflict never exists. 27 IvankaTrump.com does have a section called \"Wise Words\" (\"Nothing is impossible. The word itself says 'I'm possible'\"-Audrey Hepburn; or \"It's never too late to be what you might have been,\" wrongly attributed to George Eliot; or \"Challenges are opportunities\"-so anodyne it's not attributed to anyone.) But you'll never read anything here about processing chickens or serving up burgers or sewing jeans, or what it's like to be a secretary, a receptionist, a nurse, a hairdresser, a teacher, a saleswoman, a waitress, a bookkeeper, a cashier, or any of the other jobs at which most American women work. 28 IvankaTrump.com prefers to address style and fashion, what you can buy for work and what you should wear to work, rather than the substance of work. It includes tips on how to get promoted and tips for thinking like a Harvard Business School graduate; it includes pages about yoga for the workday, as well as about entertaining and lifestyle and exercise and what to eat and what to serve. So far, wages, discrimination, and sexual harassment have not been on the radar, not even in a Lean In -lite kind of way. That's not the purpose of the website. It should be hashtagged #womenwhobuy. 29 This is what's known today as \"femvertising.\" The best thing one can say about Ivanka's retail celebration of women is that all of the women in her ads are portrayed as doing things for other women-the campaign is positively sapphic. Like all femvertising, IvankaTrump.com soft-pedals harsh realities; everything for working women comes wrapped in the gauze of love and encouragement and uplift and cool, calm niceness. Nothing on her site has to do with women's empowerment, because empowerment is political, and the politics of female empowerment must naturally take on the bastions of male power, which Ivanka isn't likely to do. Before the election, \"Women Who Work\" was part of her branding scheme, but now it's been retooled as a political scheme for her father's administration. The scheme should be beneficial both to the administration and to the brand, but not necessarily to women who actually work. 30 * * * 31 Anyway, silly me: I thought women who worked looked like Roseanne Barr, whose late-1980s sitcom embodied all the working women I knew growing up. Roseanne's eponymous character worked in a plastics factory, was often unemployed, took a fast-food job, was a telemarketer and later a bartender, and at some point-a low point-worked as a hair sweeper at a beauty salon. And, of course, she was a waitress. This is what life was like for the working women where I grew up, in sooty New Jersey, and also, apparently, in Barr's own Salt Lake City. (It turns out that the real Roseanne Barr, who ran for president in 2012, is now a slimmed-down, styled-up, face-fixed, and committed Hillary Clinton-hater-but I'm talking about the TV character, not the woman.) And if they didn't look like Roseanne, they were pert, exhausted office workers like Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Richards: put-upon, condescended to, and belittled by their boss and male co-workers. 32 In my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs. They didn't wear slim linen trousers and strappy heels and boxy pale cashmere V-necks to work, and they still don't. They wore stretch slacks and polyester blouses. They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?). And because so many women have to some degree internalized this oppressed version of self, Ivanka can seem like a role model. She is the working woman that the working women I knew in my youth may have dreamed they'd become when they first started to work. They thought perhaps they'd make enough money to have hair like that, teeth like that. Enough money, in other words, to be free of the grinding work they had to do just to get by. 36 * * * 37 So we gaze at the lovely Ivanka. How can we help it? She is an object of fascination. She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women. One of the things My Father has said about her illustrates precisely why Ivanka won't help women as a supposed presidential influencer. When asked, in the wake of the Roger Ailes scandal, how he'd feel if Ivanka were harassed at work, Trump replied that she would never allow that to happen: If a boss were foolish enough to bother her, she'd just go out and get a new job. 38 Because Ivanka Trump can do that. The rest of us can't. Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee of the 1970s-the one exceptional person who is hired and then used to prove that everything is fine for everyone else of their kind, when patently it is not. 39 Also, one has to remember the troupe of handmaids who make Ivanka's exceptional life possible. Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne? At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage. In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park. As she says, gesturing to the skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue and the whole sprawl of the green park: \"Not a bad view to wake up to.\" 42 Sometimes, women of this kind-pampered, raised to be unthinking and self-involved-can change and end up doing incredible things. But it's rare. And under the thumb of Donald Trump, as an extension of My Father, it's almost unimaginable. Women-so many of whom are underpaid, undervalued, disregarded, and abused-shouldn't think that they can put their fate into the hands of someone who, no matter how hard she's worked in her father's company, has no clue of what struggle really means. The fact that Ivanka is supposedly guiding women's policy shows just how little-not how much-My Father cares about it. 43 Editor's note : An earlier version of this article described Ivana Trump and her parents as Croatian. In fact, they are Czech. The text has been corrected. Listen to Amy Wilentz discuss Ivanka on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\nUntil now, Ivanka's main interest in women was in getting them to buy her handbags.\n\nDespite Powell's appointment, the Trump manipulation machine wants us to think that Ivanka is really his women's-rights representative. It also wants us to think that Ivanka, although a loyal tail-wagger for her father's right-wing train wreck, is somehow above it all-that she is forward-thinking (a former bestie of Chelsea Clinton! an art collector!), almost progressive, almost feminist, and profoundly not a forgotten woman... so not Rust Belt! But jobless and officeless in Washington, at home with the kids (supposedly), Ivanka looks more retro than progressive. In fact, she has hardly spoken a public word about any policy or program since her moderate speech at the Republican National Convention. There and ever since, her only job has been to burnish Trump's kinder, gentler side (if only he had one), to soften the Stephen Bannon blow, and to brand the new administration with a contemporary attitude toward women and women's rights, rather than the attitude of a pussy-grabbing sexual predator. 8 But (and here's the important thing): For all the talk of how Ivanka has her father's ear, on women's issues or any other... he doesn't listen to her . In interview after interview, she's been clear about how little interest Trump has in her opinion. \"Does he listen to you?\" one interviewer asked. \"Depends on the day,\" came her reply. 9 One day during the transition, for example, it was made to seem that Ivanka had a brief for climate change. She met with both Al Gore and the actor and environmental enthusiast Leonardo DiCaprio. But while Ivanka, and later her father, were chatting amicably with the former vice president, Trump's transition staff was putting together a list of well-known climate-change deniers and opponents of environmental regulation to populate his government. In any case, Ivanka has no record of interest in climate change, other than having co-hosted a single climate-friendly awards gala in New York in 2008. 10 Ivanka Trump looks on as My Father speaks at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, September 13, 2016. (Reuters /Mike Segar) Trump doesn't respect his daughter as a free agent and key adviser, a role that, of all the women around Trump, only former campaign manager Kellyanne Conway-now a White House counselor-seems to inhabit. Rather, Trump respects Ivanka because of her business acumen, learned from him; no doubt he respects her cojones, which are his cojones, and he probably appreciates her \"weaponized graciousness,\" as Emily Nussbaum termed it in The New Yorker . He also appreciates that her intelligence and ability and attractiveness and poise make him look good. Like any good narcissist, he respects her because she reflects him. In other words, Ivanka is a wholly owned subsidiary of \"My Father,\" as she almost religiously called him at the Republican convention. 11 * * * 12 Even the way in which Ivanka made her first stab at empowering women shows how far from progressive on these issues she and My Father really are. She didn't go state to state talking to women about what they need, or set up teams to do that; nor did she establish ties with representatives from women's groups around the country. (If she had, perhaps one of Trump's first executive orders would not have been to cut off funding to international groups that support abortion.) Instead, she asked the hyperconnected, super-ambitious socialite Wendi Deng, former wife of Rupert Murdoch, to host a power dinner at Deng's Fifth Avenue penthouse to discuss Ivanka's new brief. In attendance was Powell herself, still nominally with Goldman Sachs at the time; a number of corporate CEOs; the head of the Ford Foundation; Daily Beast founder Tina Brown; Nancy Gibbs, the editor of Time ; and the model Christy Turlington. Aside from being around the New York social circuit, Turlington had launched Every Mother Counts in 2011, a nonprofit that supports maternal health in the United States and which advocates internationally for safe birth practices. 13 This glitzy, high-profile branding of Ivanka's portfolio was intended to mask the fact that she's had little, or possibly no, experience dealing with the very difficult problems that lie ahead for women in America. Before the election, her main interest in women was getting them to buy her clothing, her handbags, and her shoes. Who can forget the ad that went up on the Internet the day after the convention to sell her little pale pink dress? \"Shop Ivanka's look from her #RNC speech,\" her brand tweeted the next day. 14 \"Everything you need is already inside you.\" -advice to working women from IvankaTrump.com Brand always wins out over substance with her (it's part of the business mentality), and when the substance is called into question, Ivanka retreats. For example, consider her pre-election interview with Cosmopolitan writer Prachi Gupta concerning the Trump campaign's proposal for maternity leave-a policy that Ivanka is supposed to have helped Conway develop to gain women's votes for My Father. The proposed leave gives government support to mothers for six weeks after their baby is born-if they can prove legal married status and don't have jobs that will already pay for it. Although the proposal's terms are unclear, it seems to exclude half of same-sex mothers (only a birth mother can receive the benefit), all unmarried mothers, all mothers of adopted infants, and certainly all fathers, whether in heterosexual or same-sex marriages. After questioning Ivanka about who the policy would leave out, Gupta cited My Father's 2004 statement that pregnancy was \"an inconvenience for a business\" and asked, \"Can you talk a little bit about those comments, and perhaps what has changed?\" 15 Ivanka's answer: \"So I think that you have a lot of negativity in these questions, and...I don't know how useful it is to spend too much time with you on this if you're going to make a comment like that.\" When Gupta defended the question-\"it is relevant a presidential candidate made those comments\"-Ivanka shot back, \"Well, you said he made those comments. I don't know that he said those comments,\" and ended the interview shortly thereafter. You can hear the echoes of My Father in those petulant and peremptory replies. 16 * * * 17 As a child, Ivanka was a total doll, an appendage and accessory for My Father. She was a golden, green-eyed, blond-haired thing, sweet-faced, alert, self-conscious, and, at 9 or 10 years old, already sexualized in a gold-lamé, lace-hemmed minidress, white pumps, gold jewelry, and a small, gold-chained gilt purse, her hair styled, her eyes watchful. In photos from the time, she always holds hands with My Father, more like a date than a daughter, while her mother Ivana trails them in the background (as Melania usually does today). 18 My Father could never keep his hands off Ivanka. In so many pictures of the two-as a child but especially as she begins to emerge into adulthood-Trump has his hands possessively on her waist or hips. Often, she's sitting coquettishly, Lolita-ishly, on his lap. In one much-viewed photograph, he's holding her there with his hands on her hips (she in a miniskirt, long legs aimed toward the camera), and she's cupping his chin as if he were her own dear love. To the side is a gilt statue of two large copulating birds. 19 Donald Trump with his daughter Ivanka at the Maybelline presents 1991 Look of the Year at Plaza Hotel in New York City, September 3, 1991. (Globe Photos/ZumaPress) Trump, of course, once told an interviewer that it would be OK to refer to his daughter as \"a piece of ass.\" In a later interview, he said: \"You know who's one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. My daughter, Ivanka. She's six feet tall. She's got the best body.\" When asked on The View whether Ivanka would ever pose for Playboy , Trump replied: \"I don't think Ivanka would do that inside the magazine. Although she does have a very nice figure. I've said that if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her.\" He can't stop talking about her body. 20 And yet, objectified as she certainly has been by this great big blustering objectifier of women, Ivanka has managed to pick up a lot of My Father's game. She's studied Trump and knows what he likes. He doesn't go for bookish girls, so when she went to Choate-one of the country's most exclusive prep schools-she also began working as a model (getting her first cover shoot, at age 15, for Seventeen ). After all, models and actresses are the women My Father marries. Then, after proving to him that she was marriageable, she went on to try to show that she could be him as well, by working at the Trump Organization. To be the Trump daughter, you must be a living contradiction in terms. You have to be a tough, rip-roaring negotiator and deal-closer like My Father, but you also have to be a sexy, leggy, fuckable babe who doesn't give much trouble. You have to be a Trump and a target for Trump. 21 In my hometown, the women who worked smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits.

At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage. In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park. As she says, gesturing to the skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue and the whole sprawl of the green park: \"Not a bad view to wake up to.\" 42 Sometimes, women of this kind-pampered, raised to be unthinking and self-involved-can change and end up doing incredible things. But it's rare. And under the thumb of Donald Trump, as an extension of My Father, it's almost unimaginable. Women-so many of whom are underpaid, undervalued, disregarded, and abused-shouldn't think that they can put their fate into the hands of someone who, no matter how hard she's worked in her father's company, has no clue of what struggle really means. The fact that Ivanka is supposedly guiding women's policy shows just how little-not how much-My Father cares about it. 43 Editor's note : An earlier version of this article described Ivana Trump and her parents as Croatian. In fact, they are Czech. The text has been corrected. Listen to Amy Wilentz discuss Ivanka on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\nBut (and here's the important thing): For all the talk of how Ivanka has her father's ear, on women's issues or any other... he doesn't listen to her . In interview after interview, she's been clear about how little interest Trump has in her opinion. \"Does he listen to you?\" one interviewer asked. \"Depends on the day,\" came her reply. 9 One day during the transition, for example, it was made to seem that Ivanka had a brief for climate change. She met with both Al Gore and the actor and environmental enthusiast Leonardo DiCaprio. But while Ivanka, and later her father, were chatting amicably with the former vice president, Trump's transition staff was putting together a list of well-known climate-change deniers and opponents of environmental regulation to populate his government. In any case, Ivanka has no record of interest in climate change, other than having co-hosted a single climate-friendly awards gala in New York in 2008. 10 Ivanka Trump looks on as My Father speaks at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, September 13, 2016. (Reuters /Mike Segar) Trump doesn't respect his daughter as a free agent and key adviser, a role that, of all the women around Trump, only former campaign manager Kellyanne Conway-now a White House counselor-seems to inhabit. Rather, Trump respects Ivanka because of her business acumen, learned from him; no doubt he respects her cojones, which are his cojones, and he probably appreciates her \"weaponized graciousness,\" as Emily Nussbaum termed it in The New Yorker . He also appreciates that her intelligence and ability and attractiveness and poise make him look good. Like any good narcissist, he respects her because she reflects him. In other words, Ivanka is a wholly owned subsidiary of \"My Father,\" as she almost religiously called him at the Republican convention. 11 * * * 12 Even the way in which Ivanka made her first stab at empowering women shows how far from progressive on these issues she and My Father really are. She didn't go state to state talking to women about what they need, or set up teams to do that; nor did she establish ties with representatives from women's groups around the country. (If she had, perhaps one of Trump's first executive orders would not have been to cut off funding to international groups that support abortion.) Instead, she asked the hyperconnected, super-ambitious socialite Wendi Deng, former wife of Rupert Murdoch, to host a power dinner at Deng's Fifth Avenue penthouse to discuss Ivanka's new brief. In attendance was Powell herself, still nominally with Goldman Sachs at the time; a number of corporate CEOs; the head of the Ford Foundation; Daily Beast founder Tina Brown; Nancy Gibbs, the editor of Time ; and the model Christy Turlington. Aside from being around the New York social circuit, Turlington had launched Every Mother Counts in 2011, a nonprofit that supports maternal health in the United States and which advocates internationally for safe birth practices. 13 This glitzy, high-profile branding of Ivanka's portfolio was intended to mask the fact that she's had little, or possibly no, experience dealing with the very difficult problems that lie ahead for women in America. Before the election, her main interest in women was getting them to buy her clothing, her handbags, and her shoes. Who can forget the ad that went up on the Internet the day after the convention to sell her little pale pink dress? \"Shop Ivanka's look from her #RNC speech,\" her brand tweeted the next day. 14 \"Everything you need is already inside you.\" -advice to working women from IvankaTrump.com Brand always wins out over substance with her (it's part of the business mentality), and when the substance is called into question, Ivanka retreats. For example, consider her pre-election interview with Cosmopolitan writer Prachi Gupta concerning the Trump campaign's proposal for maternity leave-a policy that Ivanka is supposed to have helped Conway develop to gain women's votes for My Father. The proposed leave gives government support to mothers for six weeks after their baby is born-if they can prove legal married status and don't have jobs that will already pay for it. Although the proposal's terms are unclear, it seems to exclude half of same-sex mothers (only a birth mother can receive the benefit), all unmarried mothers, all mothers of adopted infants, and certainly all fathers, whether in heterosexual or same-sex marriages. After questioning Ivanka about who the policy would leave out, Gupta cited My Father's 2004 statement that pregnancy was \"an inconvenience for a business\" and asked, \"Can you talk a little bit about those comments, and perhaps what has changed?\" 15 Ivanka's answer: \"So I think that you have a lot of negativity in these questions, and...I don't know how useful it is to spend too much time with you on this if you're going to make a comment like that.\" When Gupta defended the question-\"it is relevant a presidential candidate made those comments\"-Ivanka shot back, \"Well, you said he made those comments. I don't know that he said those comments,\" and ended the interview shortly thereafter. You can hear the echoes of My Father in those petulant and peremptory replies. 16 * * * 17 As a child, Ivanka was a total doll, an appendage and accessory for My Father. She was a golden, green-eyed, blond-haired thing, sweet-faced, alert, self-conscious, and, at 9 or 10 years old, already sexualized in a gold-lamé, lace-hemmed minidress, white pumps, gold jewelry, and a small, gold-chained gilt purse, her hair styled, her eyes watchful. In photos from the time, she always holds hands with My Father, more like a date than a daughter, while her mother Ivana trails them in the background (as Melania usually does today). 18 My Father could never keep his hands off Ivanka. In so many pictures of the two-as a child but especially as she begins to emerge into adulthood-Trump has his hands possessively on her waist or hips. Often, she's sitting coquettishly, Lolita-ishly, on his lap. In one much-viewed photograph, he's holding her there with his hands on her hips (she in a miniskirt, long legs aimed toward the camera), and she's cupping his chin as if he were her own dear love. To the side is a gilt statue of two large copulating birds. 19 Donald Trump with his daughter Ivanka at the Maybelline presents 1991 Look of the Year at Plaza Hotel in New York City, September 3, 1991. (Globe Photos/ZumaPress) Trump, of course, once told an interviewer that it would be OK to refer to his daughter as \"a piece of ass.\" In a later interview, he said: \"You know who's one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. My daughter, Ivanka. She's six feet tall. She's got the best body.\" When asked on The View whether Ivanka would ever pose for Playboy , Trump replied: \"I don't think Ivanka would do that inside the magazine. Although she does have a very nice figure. I've said that if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her.\" He can't stop talking about her body. 20 And yet, objectified as she certainly has been by this great big blustering objectifier of women, Ivanka has managed to pick up a lot of My Father's game. She's studied Trump and knows what he likes. He doesn't go for bookish girls, so when she went to Choate-one of the country's most exclusive prep schools-she also began working as a model (getting her first cover shoot, at age 15, for Seventeen ). After all, models and actresses are the women My Father marries. Then, after proving to him that she was marriageable, she went on to try to show that she could be him as well, by working at the Trump Organization. To be the Trump daughter, you must be a living contradiction in terms. You have to be a tough, rip-roaring negotiator and deal-closer like My Father, but you also have to be a sexy, leggy, fuckable babe who doesn't give much trouble. You have to be a Trump and a target for Trump. 21 In my hometown, the women who worked smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits. No matter how much Ivanka talks about what a great parent My Father was, Trump-more available to her than to any of his other children-was still not very present. He called a lot. And he took her calls; she brags about this. He provided special treats, vacations, presents. She certainly knew that to a large degree he held the reins of her inheritance. But My Father said flat out that he didn't like to care for children; men who change diapers, he's opined, are \"acting like the wife.\" The day-to-day rearing of Ivanka and her two brothers was done by four people: two Irish nannies and Ivana Trump's Czech parents, Milos and Maria. As Bill Maher once said about Trump's kids, they're like his real-estate projects: He doesn't build 'em, but he slaps his name on 'em. 22 What this set of paternal behaviors seems to have wrought in Ivanka's character is a woman who looks at herself and other women via the male gaze. She sees herself through My Father's eyes. Look at her: Of course she's pretty and young and has a great smile. But she's also ultrafeminized-a walking advertisement. She's beyond us, better than us, like a thoroughbred. She's a virtual Miss Universe runner-up, a created feminine figure-unreal, fixed, sculpted, and styled, done up and made up, invented as a female object. 23 * * * 24 Like any good Trump, Ivanka has erected an empire atop this act of self-creation, in her case at IvankaTrump.com, a retail-cum-inspirational website where \"Women Who Work\" is a prominent channel. The video that introduces \"Women Who Work\" is a multicultural collage of 25-to-35-year-old women who choose to work and are figuring out how to make their careers blend with starting a family and keeping the home together. Not one of the women pictured says, \"I don't want to have children,\" and not one is working at a typical industrial Rust Belt, lower-level office, or service-economy job-which is to say, the expected employment for most of the female American workforce. No one in this video says, \"I hate my boss.\" 25 Most of them seem to be their own bosses, or women who have started their own businesses. None of them are over 35, none are overweight; all are cisgendered. The Women Who Work are cookie- cutter, team-leader, go-getter gals, business-school graduates perhaps, all with good hair and makeup, nothing real or pained about them. There's no evidence that any of them have struggled. They all seem to be upper-middle-class, no matter their color or ethnic background. They're from a fantasy world in which every woman can get what she wants if only she works hard enough. 26 In another video, called \"Women Who Encourage,\" two reddish-haired women remove a clutch handbag from a gift box and then-one sitting and one standing, each in pink tops with black trousers, their coppery locks wafting-look tenderly at someone off to the right of the camera. This is how working women in Ivanka's virtual universe encourage each other: by offering things that are bought (preferably from IvankaTrump .com), rather than by leading a walkout at their place of employment, say, or by supporting one another when it comes to claims of sexual harassment. On Ivanka's website, conflict never exists. 27 IvankaTrump.com does have a section called \"Wise Words\" (\"Nothing is impossible. The word itself says 'I'm possible'\"-Audrey Hepburn; or \"It's never too late to be what you might have been,\" wrongly attributed to George Eliot; or \"Challenges are opportunities\"-so anodyne it's not attributed to anyone.) But you'll never read anything here about processing chickens or serving up burgers or sewing jeans, or what it's like to be a secretary, a receptionist, a nurse, a hairdresser, a teacher, a saleswoman, a waitress, a bookkeeper, a cashier, or any of the other jobs at which most American women work. 28 IvankaTrump.com prefers to address style and fashion, what you can buy for work and what you should wear to work, rather than the substance of work. It includes tips on how to get promoted and tips for thinking like a Harvard Business School graduate; it includes pages about yoga for the workday, as well as about entertaining and lifestyle and exercise and what to eat and what to serve. So far, wages, discrimination, and sexual harassment have not been on the radar, not even in a Lean In -lite kind of way. That's not the purpose of the website. It should be hashtagged #womenwhobuy. 29 This is what's known today as \"femvertising.\" The best thing one can say about Ivanka's retail celebration of women is that all of the women in her ads are portrayed as doing things for other women-the campaign is positively sapphic. Like all femvertising, IvankaTrump.com soft-pedals harsh realities; everything for working women comes wrapped in the gauze of love and encouragement and uplift and cool, calm niceness. Nothing on her site has to do with women's empowerment, because empowerment is political, and the politics of female empowerment must naturally take on the bastions of male power, which Ivanka isn't likely to do. Before the election, \"Women Who Work\" was part of her branding scheme, but now it's been retooled as a political scheme for her father's administration. The scheme should be beneficial both to the administration and to the brand, but not necessarily to women who actually work. 30 * * * 31 Anyway, silly me: I thought women who worked looked like Roseanne Barr, whose late-1980s sitcom embodied all the working women I knew growing up. Roseanne's eponymous character worked in a plastics factory, was often unemployed, took a fast-food job, was a telemarketer and later a bartender, and at some point-a low point-worked as a hair sweeper at a beauty salon. And, of course, she was a waitress. This is what life was like for the working women where I grew up, in sooty New Jersey, and also, apparently, in Barr's own Salt Lake City. (It turns out that the real Roseanne Barr, who ran for president in 2012, is now a slimmed-down, styled-up, face-fixed, and committed Hillary Clinton-hater-but I'm talking about the TV character, not the woman.) And if they didn't look like Roseanne, they were pert, exhausted office workers like Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Richards: put-upon, condescended to, and belittled by their boss and male co-workers. 32 In my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs. They didn't wear slim linen trousers and strappy heels and boxy pale cashmere V-necks to work, and they still don't. They wore stretch slacks and polyester blouses. They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?). And because so many women have to some degree internalized this oppressed version of self, Ivanka can seem like a role model. She is the working woman that the working women I knew in my youth may have dreamed they'd become when they first started to work. They thought perhaps they'd make enough money to have hair like that, teeth like that. Enough money, in other words, to be free of the grinding work they had to do just to get by. 36 * * * 37 So we gaze at the lovely Ivanka. How can we help it? She is an object of fascination. She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women. One of the things My Father has said about her illustrates precisely why Ivanka won't help women as a supposed presidential influencer. When asked, in the wake of the Roger Ailes scandal, how he'd feel if Ivanka were harassed at work, Trump replied that she would never allow that to happen: If a boss were foolish enough to bother her, she'd just go out and get a new job. 38 Because Ivanka Trump can do that. The rest of us can't. Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee of the 1970s-the one exceptional person who is hired and then used to prove that everything is fine for everyone else of their kind, when patently it is not. 39 Also, one has to remember the troupe of handmaids who make Ivanka's exceptional life possible. Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne? At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational.

No one in this video says, \"I hate my boss.\" 25 Most of them seem to be their own bosses, or women who have started their own businesses. None of them are over 35, none are overweight; all are cisgendered. The Women Who Work are cookie- cutter, team-leader, go-getter gals, business-school graduates perhaps, all with good hair and makeup, nothing real or pained about them. There's no evidence that any of them have struggled. They all seem to be upper-middle-class, no matter their color or ethnic background. They're from a fantasy world in which every woman can get what she wants if only she works hard enough. 26 In another video, called \"Women Who Encourage,\" two reddish-haired women remove a clutch handbag from a gift box and then-one sitting and one standing, each in pink tops with black trousers, their coppery locks wafting-look tenderly at someone off to the right of the camera. This is how working women in Ivanka's virtual universe encourage each other: by offering things that are bought (preferably from IvankaTrump .com), rather than by leading a walkout at their place of employment, say, or by supporting one another when it comes to claims of sexual harassment. On Ivanka's website, conflict never exists. 27 IvankaTrump.com does have a section called \"Wise Words\" (\"Nothing is impossible. The word itself says 'I'm possible'\"-Audrey Hepburn; or \"It's never too late to be what you might have been,\" wrongly attributed to George Eliot; or \"Challenges are opportunities\"-so anodyne it's not attributed to anyone.) But you'll never read anything here about processing chickens or serving up burgers or sewing jeans, or what it's like to be a secretary, a receptionist, a nurse, a hairdresser, a teacher, a saleswoman, a waitress, a bookkeeper, a cashier, or any of the other jobs at which most American women work. 28 IvankaTrump.com prefers to address style and fashion, what you can buy for work and what you should wear to work, rather than the substance of work. It includes tips on how to get promoted and tips for thinking like a Harvard Business School graduate; it includes pages about yoga for the workday, as well as about entertaining and lifestyle and exercise and what to eat and what to serve. So far, wages, discrimination, and sexual harassment have not been on the radar, not even in a Lean In -lite kind of way. That's not the purpose of the website. It should be hashtagged #womenwhobuy. 29 This is what's known today as \"femvertising.\" The best thing one can say about Ivanka's retail celebration of women is that all of the women in her ads are portrayed as doing things for other women-the campaign is positively sapphic. Like all femvertising, IvankaTrump.com soft-pedals harsh realities; everything for working women comes wrapped in the gauze of love and encouragement and uplift and cool, calm niceness. Nothing on her site has to do with women's empowerment, because empowerment is political, and the politics of female empowerment must naturally take on the bastions of male power, which Ivanka isn't likely to do. Before the election, \"Women Who Work\" was part of her branding scheme, but now it's been retooled as a political scheme for her father's administration. The scheme should be beneficial both to the administration and to the brand, but not necessarily to women who actually work. 30 * * * 31 Anyway, silly me: I thought women who worked looked like Roseanne Barr, whose late-1980s sitcom embodied all the working women I knew growing up. Roseanne's eponymous character worked in a plastics factory, was often unemployed, took a fast-food job, was a telemarketer and later a bartender, and at some point-a low point-worked as a hair sweeper at a beauty salon. And, of course, she was a waitress. This is what life was like for the working women where I grew up, in sooty New Jersey, and also, apparently, in Barr's own Salt Lake City. (It turns out that the real Roseanne Barr, who ran for president in 2012, is now a slimmed-down, styled-up, face-fixed, and committed Hillary Clinton-hater-but I'm talking about the TV character, not the woman.) And if they didn't look like Roseanne, they were pert, exhausted office workers like Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Richards: put-upon, condescended to, and belittled by their boss and male co-workers. 32 In my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs. They didn't wear slim linen trousers and strappy heels and boxy pale cashmere V-necks to work, and they still don't. They wore stretch slacks and polyester blouses. They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?). And because so many women have to some degree internalized this oppressed version of self, Ivanka can seem like a role model. She is the working woman that the working women I knew in my youth may have dreamed they'd become when they first started to work. They thought perhaps they'd make enough money to have hair like that, teeth like that. Enough money, in other words, to be free of the grinding work they had to do just to get by. 36 * * * 37 So we gaze at the lovely Ivanka. How can we help it? She is an object of fascination. She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women. One of the things My Father has said about her illustrates precisely why Ivanka won't help women as a supposed presidential influencer. When asked, in the wake of the Roger Ailes scandal, how he'd feel if Ivanka were harassed at work, Trump replied that she would never allow that to happen: If a boss were foolish enough to bother her, she'd just go out and get a new job. 38 Because Ivanka Trump can do that. The rest of us can't. Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee of the 1970s-the one exceptional person who is hired and then used to prove that everything is fine for everyone else of their kind, when patently it is not. 39 Also, one has to remember the troupe of handmaids who make Ivanka's exceptional life possible. Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne? At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage. In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park. As she says, gesturing to the skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue and the whole sprawl of the green park: \"Not a bad view to wake up to.\" 42 Sometimes, women of this kind-pampered, raised to be unthinking and self-involved-can change and end up doing incredible things. But it's rare. And under the thumb of Donald Trump, as an extension of My Father, it's almost unimaginable. Women-so many of whom are underpaid, undervalued, disregarded, and abused-shouldn't think that they can put their fate into the hands of someone who, no matter how hard she's worked in her father's company, has no clue of what struggle really means. The fact that Ivanka is supposedly guiding women's policy shows just how little-not how much-My Father cares about it. 43 Editor's note : An earlier version of this article described Ivana Trump and her parents as Croatian. In fact, they are Czech. The text has been corrected. Listen to Amy Wilentz discuss Ivanka on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\nIvanka Trump looks on as My Father speaks at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, September 13, 2016. (Reuters /Mike Segar)\n\nTrump doesn't respect his daughter as a free agent and key adviser, a role that, of all the women around Trump, only former campaign manager Kellyanne Conway-now a White House counselor-seems to inhabit. Rather, Trump respects Ivanka because of her business acumen, learned from him; no doubt he respects her cojones, which are his cojones, and he probably appreciates her \"weaponized graciousness,\" as Emily Nussbaum termed it in The New Yorker . He also appreciates that her intelligence and ability and attractiveness and poise make him look good. Like any good narcissist, he respects her because she reflects him. In other words, Ivanka is a wholly owned subsidiary of \"My Father,\" as she almost religiously called him at the Republican convention. 11 * * * 12 Even the way in which Ivanka made her first stab at empowering women shows how far from progressive on these issues she and My Father really are. She didn't go state to state talking to women about what they need, or set up teams to do that; nor did she establish ties with representatives from women's groups around the country. (If she had, perhaps one of Trump's first executive orders would not have been to cut off funding to international groups that support abortion.) Instead, she asked the hyperconnected, super-ambitious socialite Wendi Deng, former wife of Rupert Murdoch, to host a power dinner at Deng's Fifth Avenue penthouse to discuss Ivanka's new brief. In attendance was Powell herself, still nominally with Goldman Sachs at the time; a number of corporate CEOs; the head of the Ford Foundation; Daily Beast founder Tina Brown; Nancy Gibbs, the editor of Time ; and the model Christy Turlington. Aside from being around the New York social circuit, Turlington had launched Every Mother Counts in 2011, a nonprofit that supports maternal health in the United States and which advocates internationally for safe birth practices. 13 This glitzy, high-profile branding of Ivanka's portfolio was intended to mask the fact that she's had little, or possibly no, experience dealing with the very difficult problems that lie ahead for women in America. Before the election, her main interest in women was getting them to buy her clothing, her handbags, and her shoes. Who can forget the ad that went up on the Internet the day after the convention to sell her little pale pink dress? \"Shop Ivanka's look from her #RNC speech,\" her brand tweeted the next day. 14 \"Everything you need is already inside you.\" -advice to working women from IvankaTrump.com Brand always wins out over substance with her (it's part of the business mentality), and when the substance is called into question, Ivanka retreats. For example, consider her pre-election interview with Cosmopolitan writer Prachi Gupta concerning the Trump campaign's proposal for maternity leave-a policy that Ivanka is supposed to have helped Conway develop to gain women's votes for My Father. The proposed leave gives government support to mothers for six weeks after their baby is born-if they can prove legal married status and don't have jobs that will already pay for it. Although the proposal's terms are unclear, it seems to exclude half of same-sex mothers (only a birth mother can receive the benefit), all unmarried mothers, all mothers of adopted infants, and certainly all fathers, whether in heterosexual or same-sex marriages. After questioning Ivanka about who the policy would leave out, Gupta cited My Father's 2004 statement that pregnancy was \"an inconvenience for a business\" and asked, \"Can you talk a little bit about those comments, and perhaps what has changed?\" 15 Ivanka's answer: \"So I think that you have a lot of negativity in these questions, and...I don't know how useful it is to spend too much time with you on this if you're going to make a comment like that.\" When Gupta defended the question-\"it is relevant a presidential candidate made those comments\"-Ivanka shot back, \"Well, you said he made those comments. I don't know that he said those comments,\" and ended the interview shortly thereafter. You can hear the echoes of My Father in those petulant and peremptory replies. 16 * * * 17 As a child, Ivanka was a total doll, an appendage and accessory for My Father. She was a golden, green-eyed, blond-haired thing, sweet-faced, alert, self-conscious, and, at 9 or 10 years old, already sexualized in a gold-lamé, lace-hemmed minidress, white pumps, gold jewelry, and a small, gold-chained gilt purse, her hair styled, her eyes watchful. In photos from the time, she always holds hands with My Father, more like a date than a daughter, while her mother Ivana trails them in the background (as Melania usually does today). 18 My Father could never keep his hands off Ivanka. In so many pictures of the two-as a child but especially as she begins to emerge into adulthood-Trump has his hands possessively on her waist or hips. Often, she's sitting coquettishly, Lolita-ishly, on his lap. In one much-viewed photograph, he's holding her there with his hands on her hips (she in a miniskirt, long legs aimed toward the camera), and she's cupping his chin as if he were her own dear love. To the side is a gilt statue of two large copulating birds. 19 Donald Trump with his daughter Ivanka at the Maybelline presents 1991 Look of the Year at Plaza Hotel in New York City, September 3, 1991. (Globe Photos/ZumaPress) Trump, of course, once told an interviewer that it would be OK to refer to his daughter as \"a piece of ass.\" In a later interview, he said: \"You know who's one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. My daughter, Ivanka. She's six feet tall. She's got the best body.\" When asked on The View whether Ivanka would ever pose for Playboy , Trump replied: \"I don't think Ivanka would do that inside the magazine. Although she does have a very nice figure. I've said that if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her.\" He can't stop talking about her body. 20 And yet, objectified as she certainly has been by this great big blustering objectifier of women, Ivanka has managed to pick up a lot of My Father's game. She's studied Trump and knows what he likes. He doesn't go for bookish girls, so when she went to Choate-one of the country's most exclusive prep schools-she also began working as a model (getting her first cover shoot, at age 15, for Seventeen ). After all, models and actresses are the women My Father marries. Then, after proving to him that she was marriageable, she went on to try to show that she could be him as well, by working at the Trump Organization. To be the Trump daughter, you must be a living contradiction in terms. You have to be a tough, rip-roaring negotiator and deal-closer like My Father, but you also have to be a sexy, leggy, fuckable babe who doesn't give much trouble. You have to be a Trump and a target for Trump. 21 In my hometown, the women who worked smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits. No matter how much Ivanka talks about what a great parent My Father was, Trump-more available to her than to any of his other children-was still not very present. He called a lot. And he took her calls; she brags about this. He provided special treats, vacations, presents. She certainly knew that to a large degree he held the reins of her inheritance. But My Father said flat out that he didn't like to care for children; men who change diapers, he's opined, are \"acting like the wife.\" The day-to-day rearing of Ivanka and her two brothers was done by four people: two Irish nannies and Ivana Trump's Czech parents, Milos and Maria. As Bill Maher once said about Trump's kids, they're like his real-estate projects: He doesn't build 'em, but he slaps his name on 'em. 22 What this set of paternal behaviors seems to have wrought in Ivanka's character is a woman who looks at herself and other women via the male gaze. She sees herself through My Father's eyes. Look at her: Of course she's pretty and young and has a great smile. But she's also ultrafeminized-a walking advertisement. She's beyond us, better than us, like a thoroughbred. She's a virtual Miss Universe runner-up, a created feminine figure-unreal, fixed, sculpted, and styled, done up and made up, invented as a female object. 23 * * * 24 Like any good Trump, Ivanka has erected an empire atop this act of self-creation, in her case at IvankaTrump.com, a retail-cum-inspirational website where \"Women Who Work\" is a prominent channel. The video that introduces \"Women Who Work\" is a multicultural collage of 25-to-35-year-old women who choose to work and are figuring out how to make their careers blend with starting a family and keeping the home together. Not one of the women pictured says, \"I don't want to have children,\" and not one is working at a typical industrial Rust Belt, lower-level office, or service-economy job-which is to say, the expected employment for most of the female American workforce. No one in this video says, \"I hate my boss.\" 25 Most of them seem to be their own bosses, or women who have started their own businesses. None of them are over 35, none are overweight; all are cisgendered. The Women Who Work are cookie- cutter, team-leader, go-getter gals, business-school graduates perhaps, all with good hair and makeup, nothing real or pained about them. There's no evidence that any of them have struggled. They all seem to be upper-middle-class, no matter their color or ethnic background. They're from a fantasy world in which every woman can get what she wants if only she works hard enough. 26 In another video, called \"Women Who Encourage,\" two reddish-haired women remove a clutch handbag from a gift box and then-one sitting and one standing, each in pink tops with black trousers, their coppery locks wafting-look tenderly at someone off to the right of the camera. This is how working women in Ivanka's virtual universe encourage each other: by offering things that are bought (preferably from IvankaTrump .com), rather than by leading a walkout at their place of employment, say, or by supporting one another when it comes to claims of sexual harassment.

It includes tips on how to get promoted and tips for thinking like a Harvard Business School graduate; it includes pages about yoga for the workday, as well as about entertaining and lifestyle and exercise and what to eat and what to serve. So far, wages, discrimination, and sexual harassment have not been on the radar, not even in a Lean In -lite kind of way. That's not the purpose of the website.

The scheme should be beneficial both to the administration and to the brand, but not necessarily to women who actually work. 30 * * * 31 Anyway, silly me: I thought women who worked looked like Roseanne Barr, whose late-1980s sitcom embodied all the working women I knew growing up. Roseanne's eponymous character worked in a plastics factory, was often unemployed, took a fast-food job, was a telemarketer and later a bartender, and at some point-a low point-worked as a hair sweeper at a beauty salon. And, of course, she was a waitress. This is what life was like for the working women where I grew up, in sooty New Jersey, and also, apparently, in Barr's own Salt Lake City.

And if they didn't look like Roseanne, they were pert, exhausted office workers like Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Richards: put-upon, condescended to, and belittled by their boss and male co-workers. 32 In my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs.

They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked.

For example, consider her pre-election interview with Cosmopolitan writer Prachi Gupta concerning the Trump campaign's proposal for maternity leave-a policy that Ivanka is supposed to have helped Conway develop to gain women's votes for My Father. The proposed leave gives government support to mothers for six weeks after their baby is born-if they can prove legal married status and don't have jobs that will already pay for it. Although the proposal's terms are unclear, it seems to exclude half of same-sex mothers (only a birth mother can receive the benefit), all unmarried mothers, all mothers of adopted infants, and certainly all fathers, whether in heterosexual or same-sex marriages. After questioning Ivanka about who the policy would leave out, Gupta cited My Father's 2004 statement that pregnancy was \"an inconvenience for a business\" and asked, \"Can you talk a little bit about those comments, and perhaps what has changed?\" 15 Ivanka's answer: \"So I think that you have a lot of negativity in these questions, and...I don't know how useful it is to spend too much time with you on this if you're going to make a comment like that.\" When Gupta defended the question-\"it is relevant a presidential candidate made those comments\"-Ivanka shot back, \"Well, you said he made those comments. I don't know that he said those comments,\" and ended the interview shortly thereafter. You can hear the echoes of My Father in those petulant and peremptory replies. 16 * * * 17 As a child, Ivanka was a total doll, an appendage and accessory for My Father. She was a golden, green-eyed, blond-haired thing, sweet-faced, alert, self-conscious, and, at 9 or 10 years old, already sexualized in a gold-lamé, lace-hemmed minidress, white pumps, gold jewelry, and a small, gold-chained gilt purse, her hair styled, her eyes watchful. In photos from the time, she always holds hands with My Father, more like a date than a daughter, while her mother Ivana trails them in the background (as Melania usually does today). 18 My Father could never keep his hands off Ivanka. In so many pictures of the two-as a child but especially as she begins to emerge into adulthood-Trump has his hands possessively on her waist or hips. Often, she's sitting coquettishly, Lolita-ishly, on his lap. In one much-viewed photograph, he's holding her there with his hands on her hips (she in a miniskirt, long legs aimed toward the camera), and she's cupping his chin as if he were her own dear love. To the side is a gilt statue of two large copulating birds. 19 Donald Trump with his daughter Ivanka at the Maybelline presents 1991 Look of the Year at Plaza Hotel in New York City, September 3, 1991. (Globe Photos/ZumaPress) Trump, of course, once told an interviewer that it would be OK to refer to his daughter as \"a piece of ass.\" In a later interview, he said: \"You know who's one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. My daughter, Ivanka. She's six feet tall. She's got the best body.\" When asked on The View whether Ivanka would ever pose for Playboy , Trump replied: \"I don't think Ivanka would do that inside the magazine. Although she does have a very nice figure. I've said that if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her.\" He can't stop talking about her body. 20 And yet, objectified as she certainly has been by this great big blustering objectifier of women, Ivanka has managed to pick up a lot of My Father's game. She's studied Trump and knows what he likes. He doesn't go for bookish girls, so when she went to Choate-one of the country's most exclusive prep schools-she also began working as a model (getting her first cover shoot, at age 15, for Seventeen ). After all, models and actresses are the women My Father marries. Then, after proving to him that she was marriageable, she went on to try to show that she could be him as well, by working at the Trump Organization. To be the Trump daughter, you must be a living contradiction in terms. You have to be a tough, rip-roaring negotiator and deal-closer like My Father, but you also have to be a sexy, leggy, fuckable babe who doesn't give much trouble. You have to be a Trump and a target for Trump. 21 In my hometown, the women who worked smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits. No matter how much Ivanka talks about what a great parent My Father was, Trump-more available to her than to any of his other children-was still not very present. He called a lot. And he took her calls; she brags about this. He provided special treats, vacations, presents. She certainly knew that to a large degree he held the reins of her inheritance. But My Father said flat out that he didn't like to care for children; men who change diapers, he's opined, are \"acting like the wife.\" The day-to-day rearing of Ivanka and her two brothers was done by four people: two Irish nannies and Ivana Trump's Czech parents, Milos and Maria. As Bill Maher once said about Trump's kids, they're like his real-estate projects: He doesn't build 'em, but he slaps his name on 'em. 22 What this set of paternal behaviors seems to have wrought in Ivanka's character is a woman who looks at herself and other women via the male gaze. She sees herself through My Father's eyes. Look at her: Of course she's pretty and young and has a great smile. But she's also ultrafeminized-a walking advertisement. She's beyond us, better than us, like a thoroughbred. She's a virtual Miss Universe runner-up, a created feminine figure-unreal, fixed, sculpted, and styled, done up and made up, invented as a female object. 23 * * * 24 Like any good Trump, Ivanka has erected an empire atop this act of self-creation, in her case at IvankaTrump.com, a retail-cum-inspirational website where \"Women Who Work\" is a prominent channel. The video that introduces \"Women Who Work\" is a multicultural collage of 25-to-35-year-old women who choose to work and are figuring out how to make their careers blend with starting a family and keeping the home together. Not one of the women pictured says, \"I don't want to have children,\" and not one is working at a typical industrial Rust Belt, lower-level office, or service-economy job-which is to say, the expected employment for most of the female American workforce. No one in this video says, \"I hate my boss.\" 25 Most of them seem to be their own bosses, or women who have started their own businesses. None of them are over 35, none are overweight; all are cisgendered. The Women Who Work are cookie- cutter, team-leader, go-getter gals, business-school graduates perhaps, all with good hair and makeup, nothing real or pained about them. There's no evidence that any of them have struggled. They all seem to be upper-middle-class, no matter their color or ethnic background. They're from a fantasy world in which every woman can get what she wants if only she works hard enough. 26 In another video, called \"Women Who Encourage,\" two reddish-haired women remove a clutch handbag from a gift box and then-one sitting and one standing, each in pink tops with black trousers, their coppery locks wafting-look tenderly at someone off to the right of the camera. This is how working women in Ivanka's virtual universe encourage each other: by offering things that are bought (preferably from IvankaTrump .com), rather than by leading a walkout at their place of employment, say, or by supporting one another when it comes to claims of sexual harassment. On Ivanka's website, conflict never exists. 27 IvankaTrump.com does have a section called \"Wise Words\" (\"Nothing is impossible. The word itself says 'I'm possible'\"-Audrey Hepburn; or \"It's never too late to be what you might have been,\" wrongly attributed to George Eliot; or \"Challenges are opportunities\"-so anodyne it's not attributed to anyone.) But you'll never read anything here about processing chickens or serving up burgers or sewing jeans, or what it's like to be a secretary, a receptionist, a nurse, a hairdresser, a teacher, a saleswoman, a waitress, a bookkeeper, a cashier, or any of the other jobs at which most American women work. 28 IvankaTrump.com prefers to address style and fashion, what you can buy for work and what you should wear to work, rather than the substance of work. It includes tips on how to get promoted and tips for thinking like a Harvard Business School graduate; it includes pages about yoga for the workday, as well as about entertaining and lifestyle and exercise and what to eat and what to serve. So far, wages, discrimination, and sexual harassment have not been on the radar, not even in a Lean In -lite kind of way. That's not the purpose of the website. It should be hashtagged #womenwhobuy. 29 This is what's known today as \"femvertising.\" The best thing one can say about Ivanka's retail celebration of women is that all of the women in her ads are portrayed as doing things for other women-the campaign is positively sapphic. Like all femvertising, IvankaTrump.com soft-pedals harsh realities; everything for working women comes wrapped in the gauze of love and encouragement and uplift and cool, calm niceness. Nothing on her site has to do with women's empowerment, because empowerment is political, and the politics of female empowerment must naturally take on the bastions of male power, which Ivanka isn't likely to do. Before the election, \"Women Who Work\" was part of her branding scheme, but now it's been retooled as a political scheme for her father's administration. The scheme should be beneficial both to the administration and to the brand, but not necessarily to women who actually work. 30 * * * 31 Anyway, silly me: I thought women who worked looked like Roseanne Barr, whose late-1980s sitcom embodied all the working women I knew growing up. Roseanne's eponymous character worked in a plastics factory, was often unemployed, took a fast-food job, was a telemarketer and later a bartender, and at some point-a low point-worked as a hair sweeper at a beauty salon. And, of course, she was a waitress. This is what life was like for the working women where I grew up, in sooty New Jersey, and also, apparently, in Barr's own Salt Lake City. (It turns out that the real Roseanne Barr, who ran for president in 2012, is now a slimmed-down, styled-up, face-fixed, and committed Hillary Clinton-hater-but I'm talking about the TV character, not the woman.) And if they didn't look like Roseanne, they were pert, exhausted office workers like Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Richards: put-upon, condescended to, and belittled by their boss and male co-workers. 32 In my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs. They didn't wear slim linen trousers and strappy heels and boxy pale cashmere V-necks to work, and they still don't. They wore stretch slacks and polyester blouses. They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?). And because so many women have to some degree internalized this oppressed version of self, Ivanka can seem like a role model. She is the working woman that the working women I knew in my youth may have dreamed they'd become when they first started to work. They thought perhaps they'd make enough money to have hair like that, teeth like that. Enough money, in other words, to be free of the grinding work they had to do just to get by. 36 * * * 37 So we gaze at the lovely Ivanka. How can we help it? She is an object of fascination. She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women. One of the things My Father has said about her illustrates precisely why Ivanka won't help women as a supposed presidential influencer. When asked, in the wake of the Roger Ailes scandal, how he'd feel if Ivanka were harassed at work, Trump replied that she would never allow that to happen: If a boss were foolish enough to bother her, she'd just go out and get a new job. 38 Because Ivanka Trump can do that. The rest of us can't. Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee of the 1970s-the one exceptional person who is hired and then used to prove that everything is fine for everyone else of their kind, when patently it is not. 39 Also, one has to remember the troupe of handmaids who make Ivanka's exceptional life possible. Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne? At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage. In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park. As she says, gesturing to the skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue and the whole sprawl of the green park: \"Not a bad view to wake up to.\" 42 Sometimes, women of this kind-pampered, raised to be unthinking and self-involved-can change and end up doing incredible things. But it's rare. And under the thumb of Donald Trump, as an extension of My Father, it's almost unimaginable. Women-so many of whom are underpaid, undervalued, disregarded, and abused-shouldn't think that they can put their fate into the hands of someone who, no matter how hard she's worked in her father's company, has no clue of what struggle really means. The fact that Ivanka is supposedly guiding women's policy shows just how little-not how much-My Father cares about it. 43 Editor's note : An earlier version of this article described Ivana Trump and her parents as Croatian. In fact, they are Czech. The text has been corrected. Listen to Amy Wilentz discuss Ivanka on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\nEven the way in which Ivanka made her first stab at empowering women shows how far from progressive on these issues she and My Father really are. She didn't go state to state talking to women about what they need, or set up teams to do that; nor did she establish ties with representatives from women's groups around the country. (If she had, perhaps one of Trump's first executive orders would not have been to cut off funding to international groups that support abortion.) Instead, she asked the hyperconnected, super-ambitious socialite Wendi Deng, former wife of Rupert Murdoch, to host a power dinner at Deng's Fifth Avenue penthouse to discuss Ivanka's new brief. In attendance was Powell herself, still nominally with Goldman Sachs at the time; a number of corporate CEOs; the head of the Ford Foundation; Daily Beast founder Tina Brown; Nancy Gibbs, the editor of Time ; and the model Christy Turlington. Aside from being around the New York social circuit, Turlington had launched Every Mother Counts in 2011, a nonprofit that supports maternal health in the United States and which advocates internationally for safe birth practices. 13 This glitzy, high-profile branding of Ivanka's portfolio was intended to mask the fact that she's had little, or possibly no, experience dealing with the very difficult problems that lie ahead for women in America. Before the election, her main interest in women was getting them to buy her clothing, her handbags, and her shoes. Who can forget the ad that went up on the Internet the day after the convention to sell her little pale pink dress? \"Shop Ivanka's look from her #RNC speech,\" her brand tweeted the next day. 14 \"Everything you need is already inside you.\" -advice to working women from IvankaTrump.com Brand always wins out over substance with her (it's part of the business mentality), and when the substance is called into question, Ivanka retreats.

Enough money, in other words, to be free of the grinding work they had to do just to get by. 36 * * * 37 So we gaze at the lovely Ivanka. How can we help it? She is an object of fascination. She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women. One of the things My Father has said about her illustrates precisely why Ivanka won't help women as a supposed presidential influencer. When asked, in the wake of the Roger Ailes scandal, how he'd feel if Ivanka were harassed at work, Trump replied that she would never allow that to happen: If a boss were foolish enough to bother her, she'd just go out and get a new job. 38 Because Ivanka Trump can do that. The rest of us can't. Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee of the 1970s-the one exceptional person who is hired and then used to prove that everything is fine for everyone else of their kind, when patently it is not. 39 Also, one has to remember the troupe of handmaids who make Ivanka's exceptional life possible. Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne? At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage. In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park. As she says, gesturing to the skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue and the whole sprawl of the green park: \"Not a bad view to wake up to.\" 42 Sometimes, women of this kind-pampered, raised to be unthinking and self-involved-can change and end up doing incredible things. But it's rare. And under the thumb of Donald Trump, as an extension of My Father, it's almost unimaginable. Women-so many of whom are underpaid, undervalued, disregarded, and abused-shouldn't think that they can put their fate into the hands of someone who, no matter how hard she's worked in her father's company, has no clue of what struggle really means. The fact that Ivanka is supposedly guiding women's policy shows just how little-not how much-My Father cares about it. 43 Editor's note : An earlier version of this article described Ivana Trump and her parents as Croatian. In fact, they are Czech. The text has been corrected. Listen to Amy Wilentz discuss Ivanka on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\nThis glitzy, high-profile branding of Ivanka's portfolio was intended to mask the fact that she's had little, or possibly no, experience dealing with the very difficult problems that lie ahead for women in America. Before the election, her main interest in women was getting them to buy her clothing, her handbags, and her shoes. Who can forget the ad that went up on the Internet the day after the convention to sell her little pale pink dress? \"Shop Ivanka's look from her #RNC speech,\" her brand tweeted the next day. 14 \"Everything you need is already inside you.\" -advice to working women from IvankaTrump.com Brand always wins out over substance with her (it's part of the business mentality), and when the substance is called into question, Ivanka retreats. For example, consider her pre-election interview with Cosmopolitan writer Prachi Gupta concerning the Trump campaign's proposal for maternity leave-a policy that Ivanka is supposed to have helped Conway develop to gain women's votes for My Father. The proposed leave gives government support to mothers for six weeks after their baby is born-if they can prove legal married status and don't have jobs that will already pay for it. Although the proposal's terms are unclear, it seems to exclude half of same-sex mothers (only a birth mother can receive the benefit), all unmarried mothers, all mothers of adopted infants, and certainly all fathers, whether in heterosexual or same-sex marriages. After questioning Ivanka about who the policy would leave out, Gupta cited My Father's 2004 statement that pregnancy was \"an inconvenience for a business\" and asked, \"Can you talk a little bit about those comments, and perhaps what has changed?\" 15 Ivanka's answer: \"So I think that you have a lot of negativity in these questions, and...I don't know how useful it is to spend too much time with you on this if you're going to make a comment like that.\" When Gupta defended the question-\"it is relevant a presidential candidate made those comments\"-Ivanka shot back, \"Well, you said he made those comments. I don't know that he said those comments,\" and ended the interview shortly thereafter. You can hear the echoes of My Father in those petulant and peremptory replies. 16 * * * 17 As a child, Ivanka was a total doll, an appendage and accessory for My Father. She was a golden, green-eyed, blond-haired thing, sweet-faced, alert, self-conscious, and, at 9 or 10 years old, already sexualized in a gold-lamé, lace-hemmed minidress, white pumps, gold jewelry, and a small, gold-chained gilt purse, her hair styled, her eyes watchful. In photos from the time, she always holds hands with My Father, more like a date than a daughter, while her mother Ivana trails them in the background (as Melania usually does today). 18 My Father could never keep his hands off Ivanka. In so many pictures of the two-as a child but especially as she begins to emerge into adulthood-Trump has his hands possessively on her waist or hips. Often, she's sitting coquettishly, Lolita-ishly, on his lap. In one much-viewed photograph, he's holding her there with his hands on her hips (she in a miniskirt, long legs aimed toward the camera), and she's cupping his chin as if he were her own dear love. To the side is a gilt statue of two large copulating birds. 19 Donald Trump with his daughter Ivanka at the Maybelline presents 1991 Look of the Year at Plaza Hotel in New York City, September 3, 1991. (Globe Photos/ZumaPress) Trump, of course, once told an interviewer that it would be OK to refer to his daughter as \"a piece of ass.\" In a later interview, he said: \"You know who's one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. My daughter, Ivanka. She's six feet tall. She's got the best body.\" When asked on The View whether Ivanka would ever pose for Playboy , Trump replied: \"I don't think Ivanka would do that inside the magazine. Although she does have a very nice figure. I've said that if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her.\" He can't stop talking about her body. 20 And yet, objectified as she certainly has been by this great big blustering objectifier of women, Ivanka has managed to pick up a lot of My Father's game. She's studied Trump and knows what he likes. He doesn't go for bookish girls, so when she went to Choate-one of the country's most exclusive prep schools-she also began working as a model (getting her first cover shoot, at age 15, for Seventeen ). After all, models and actresses are the women My Father marries. Then, after proving to him that she was marriageable, she went on to try to show that she could be him as well, by working at the Trump Organization. To be the Trump daughter, you must be a living contradiction in terms. You have to be a tough, rip-roaring negotiator and deal-closer like My Father, but you also have to be a sexy, leggy, fuckable babe who doesn't give much trouble. You have to be a Trump and a target for Trump. 21 In my hometown, the women who worked smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits. No matter how much Ivanka talks about what a great parent My Father was, Trump-more available to her than to any of his other children-was still not very present. He called a lot. And he took her calls; she brags about this. He provided special treats, vacations, presents. She certainly knew that to a large degree he held the reins of her inheritance. But My Father said flat out that he didn't like to care for children; men who change diapers, he's opined, are \"acting like the wife.\" The day-to-day rearing of Ivanka and her two brothers was done by four people: two Irish nannies and Ivana Trump's Czech parents, Milos and Maria. As Bill Maher once said about Trump's kids, they're like his real-estate projects: He doesn't build 'em, but he slaps his name on 'em. 22 What this set of paternal behaviors seems to have wrought in Ivanka's character is a woman who looks at herself and other women via the male gaze. She sees herself through My Father's eyes. Look at her: Of course she's pretty and young and has a great smile. But she's also ultrafeminized-a walking advertisement. She's beyond us, better than us, like a thoroughbred. She's a virtual Miss Universe runner-up, a created feminine figure-unreal, fixed, sculpted, and styled, done up and made up, invented as a female object. 23 * * * 24 Like any good Trump, Ivanka has erected an empire atop this act of self-creation, in her case at IvankaTrump.com, a retail-cum-inspirational website where \"Women Who Work\" is a prominent channel. The video that introduces \"Women Who Work\" is a multicultural collage of 25-to-35-year-old women who choose to work and are figuring out how to make their careers blend with starting a family and keeping the home together. Not one of the women pictured says, \"I don't want to have children,\" and not one is working at a typical industrial Rust Belt, lower-level office, or service-economy job-which is to say, the expected employment for most of the female American workforce. No one in this video says, \"I hate my boss.\" 25 Most of them seem to be their own bosses, or women who have started their own businesses. None of them are over 35, none are overweight; all are cisgendered. The Women Who Work are cookie- cutter, team-leader, go-getter gals, business-school graduates perhaps, all with good hair and makeup, nothing real or pained about them. There's no evidence that any of them have struggled. They all seem to be upper-middle-class, no matter their color or ethnic background. They're from a fantasy world in which every woman can get what she wants if only she works hard enough. 26 In another video, called \"Women Who Encourage,\" two reddish-haired women remove a clutch handbag from a gift box and then-one sitting and one standing, each in pink tops with black trousers, their coppery locks wafting-look tenderly at someone off to the right of the camera. This is how working women in Ivanka's virtual universe encourage each other: by offering things that are bought (preferably from IvankaTrump .com), rather than by leading a walkout at their place of employment, say, or by supporting one another when it comes to claims of sexual harassment. On Ivanka's website, conflict never exists. 27 IvankaTrump.com does have a section called \"Wise Words\" (\"Nothing is impossible. The word itself says 'I'm possible'\"-Audrey Hepburn; or \"It's never too late to be what you might have been,\" wrongly attributed to George Eliot; or \"Challenges are opportunities\"-so anodyne it's not attributed to anyone.) But you'll never read anything here about processing chickens or serving up burgers or sewing jeans, or what it's like to be a secretary, a receptionist, a nurse, a hairdresser, a teacher, a saleswoman, a waitress, a bookkeeper, a cashier, or any of the other jobs at which most American women work. 28 IvankaTrump.com prefers to address style and fashion, what you can buy for work and what you should wear to work, rather than the substance of work. It includes tips on how to get promoted and tips for thinking like a Harvard Business School graduate; it includes pages about yoga for the workday, as well as about entertaining and lifestyle and exercise and what to eat and what to serve. So far, wages, discrimination, and sexual harassment have not been on the radar, not even in a Lean In -lite kind of way. That's not the purpose of the website. It should be hashtagged #womenwhobuy. 29 This is what's known today as \"femvertising.\" The best thing one can say about Ivanka's retail celebration of women is that all of the women in her ads are portrayed as doing things for other women-the campaign is positively sapphic. Like all femvertising, IvankaTrump.com soft-pedals harsh realities; everything for working women comes wrapped in the gauze of love and encouragement and uplift and cool, calm niceness. Nothing on her site has to do with women's empowerment, because empowerment is political, and the politics of female empowerment must naturally take on the bastions of male power, which Ivanka isn't likely to do. Before the election, \"Women Who Work\" was part of her branding scheme, but now it's been retooled as a political scheme for her father's administration. The scheme should be beneficial both to the administration and to the brand, but not necessarily to women who actually work. 30 * * * 31 Anyway, silly me: I thought women who worked looked like Roseanne Barr, whose late-1980s sitcom embodied all the working women I knew growing up. Roseanne's eponymous character worked in a plastics factory, was often unemployed, took a fast-food job, was a telemarketer and later a bartender, and at some point-a low point-worked as a hair sweeper at a beauty salon. And, of course, she was a waitress. This is what life was like for the working women where I grew up, in sooty New Jersey, and also, apparently, in Barr's own Salt Lake City. (It turns out that the real Roseanne Barr, who ran for president in 2012, is now a slimmed-down, styled-up, face-fixed, and committed Hillary Clinton-hater-but I'm talking about the TV character, not the woman.) And if they didn't look like Roseanne, they were pert, exhausted office workers like Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Richards: put-upon, condescended to, and belittled by their boss and male co-workers. 32 In my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs. They didn't wear slim linen trousers and strappy heels and boxy pale cashmere V-necks to work, and they still don't. They wore stretch slacks and polyester blouses. They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?). And because so many women have to some degree internalized this oppressed version of self, Ivanka can seem like a role model. She is the working woman that the working women I knew in my youth may have dreamed they'd become when they first started to work. They thought perhaps they'd make enough money to have hair like that, teeth like that. Enough money, in other words, to be free of the grinding work they had to do just to get by. 36 * * * 37 So we gaze at the lovely Ivanka. How can we help it? She is an object of fascination. She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women.

The rest of us can't. Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee of the 1970s-the one exceptional person who is hired and then used to prove that everything is fine for everyone else of their kind, when patently it is not. 39 Also, one has to remember the troupe of handmaids who make Ivanka's exceptional life possible. Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne? At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage. In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park.

And if they didn't look like Roseanne, they were pert, exhausted office workers like Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Richards: put-upon, condescended to, and belittled by their boss and male co-workers. 32 In my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs. They didn't wear slim linen trousers and strappy heels and boxy pale cashmere V-necks to work, and they still don't. They wore stretch slacks and polyester blouses. They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?). And because so many women have to some degree internalized this oppressed version of self, Ivanka can seem like a role model. She is the working woman that the working women I knew in my youth may have dreamed they'd become when they first started to work. They thought perhaps they'd make enough money to have hair like that, teeth like that. Enough money, in other words, to be free of the grinding work they had to do just to get by. 36 * * * 37 So we gaze at the lovely Ivanka. How can we help it? She is an object of fascination. She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women. One of the things My Father has said about her illustrates precisely why Ivanka won't help women as a supposed presidential influencer. When asked, in the wake of the Roger Ailes scandal, how he'd feel if Ivanka were harassed at work, Trump replied that she would never allow that to happen: If a boss were foolish enough to bother her, she'd just go out and get a new job. 38 Because Ivanka Trump can do that. The rest of us can't. Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee of the 1970s-the one exceptional person who is hired and then used to prove that everything is fine for everyone else of their kind, when patently it is not. 39 Also, one has to remember the troupe of handmaids who make Ivanka's exceptional life possible. Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne? At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage. In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park. As she says, gesturing to the skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue and the whole sprawl of the green park: \"Not a bad view to wake up to.\" 42 Sometimes, women of this kind-pampered, raised to be unthinking and self-involved-can change and end up doing incredible things. But it's rare. And under the thumb of Donald Trump, as an extension of My Father, it's almost unimaginable. Women-so many of whom are underpaid, undervalued, disregarded, and abused-shouldn't think that they can put their fate into the hands of someone who, no matter how hard she's worked in her father's company, has no clue of what struggle really means. The fact that Ivanka is supposedly guiding women's policy shows just how little-not how much-My Father cares about it. 43 Editor's note : An earlier version of this article described Ivana Trump and her parents as Croatian. In fact, they are Czech. The text has been corrected. Listen to Amy Wilentz discuss Ivanka on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\nIvanka's answer: \"So I think that you have a lot of negativity in these questions, and...I don't know how useful it is to spend too much time with you on this if you're going to make a comment like that.\" When Gupta defended the question-\"it is relevant a presidential candidate made those comments\"-Ivanka shot back, \"Well, you said he made those comments. I don't know that he said those comments,\" and ended the interview shortly thereafter. You can hear the echoes of My Father in those petulant and peremptory replies. 16 * * * 17 As a child, Ivanka was a total doll, an appendage and accessory for My Father. She was a golden, green-eyed, blond-haired thing, sweet-faced, alert, self-conscious, and, at 9 or 10 years old, already sexualized in a gold-lamé, lace-hemmed minidress, white pumps, gold jewelry, and a small, gold-chained gilt purse, her hair styled, her eyes watchful. In photos from the time, she always holds hands with My Father, more like a date than a daughter, while her mother Ivana trails them in the background (as Melania usually does today). 18 My Father could never keep his hands off Ivanka. In so many pictures of the two-as a child but especially as she begins to emerge into adulthood-Trump has his hands possessively on her waist or hips. Often, she's sitting coquettishly, Lolita-ishly, on his lap. In one much-viewed photograph, he's holding her there with his hands on her hips (she in a miniskirt, long legs aimed toward the camera), and she's cupping his chin as if he were her own dear love. To the side is a gilt statue of two large copulating birds. 19 Donald Trump with his daughter Ivanka at the Maybelline presents 1991 Look of the Year at Plaza Hotel in New York City, September 3, 1991. (Globe Photos/ZumaPress) Trump, of course, once told an interviewer that it would be OK to refer to his daughter as \"a piece of ass.\" In a later interview, he said: \"You know who's one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. My daughter, Ivanka. She's six feet tall. She's got the best body.\" When asked on The View whether Ivanka would ever pose for Playboy , Trump replied: \"I don't think Ivanka would do that inside the magazine. Although she does have a very nice figure. I've said that if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her.\" He can't stop talking about her body. 20 And yet, objectified as she certainly has been by this great big blustering objectifier of women, Ivanka has managed to pick up a lot of My Father's game. She's studied Trump and knows what he likes. He doesn't go for bookish girls, so when she went to Choate-one of the country's most exclusive prep schools-she also began working as a model (getting her first cover shoot, at age 15, for Seventeen ). After all, models and actresses are the women My Father marries. Then, after proving to him that she was marriageable, she went on to try to show that she could be him as well, by working at the Trump Organization. To be the Trump daughter, you must be a living contradiction in terms. You have to be a tough, rip-roaring negotiator and deal-closer like My Father, but you also have to be a sexy, leggy, fuckable babe who doesn't give much trouble. You have to be a Trump and a target for Trump. 21 In my hometown, the women who worked smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits. No matter how much Ivanka talks about what a great parent My Father was, Trump-more available to her than to any of his other children-was still not very present. He called a lot. And he took her calls; she brags about this. He provided special treats, vacations, presents. She certainly knew that to a large degree he held the reins of her inheritance. But My Father said flat out that he didn't like to care for children; men who change diapers, he's opined, are \"acting like the wife.\" The day-to-day rearing of Ivanka and her two brothers was done by four people: two Irish nannies and Ivana Trump's Czech parents, Milos and Maria. As Bill Maher once said about Trump's kids, they're like his real-estate projects: He doesn't build 'em, but he slaps his name on 'em. 22 What this set of paternal behaviors seems to have wrought in Ivanka's character is a woman who looks at herself and other women via the male gaze. She sees herself through My Father's eyes. Look at her: Of course she's pretty and young and has a great smile. But she's also ultrafeminized-a walking advertisement. She's beyond us, better than us, like a thoroughbred. She's a virtual Miss Universe runner-up, a created feminine figure-unreal, fixed, sculpted, and styled, done up and made up, invented as a female object. 23 * * * 24 Like any good Trump, Ivanka has erected an empire atop this act of self-creation, in her case at IvankaTrump.com, a retail-cum-inspirational website where \"Women Who Work\" is a prominent channel. The video that introduces \"Women Who Work\" is a multicultural collage of 25-to-35-year-old women who choose to work and are figuring out how to make their careers blend with starting a family and keeping the home together. Not one of the women pictured says, \"I don't want to have children,\" and not one is working at a typical industrial Rust Belt, lower-level office, or service-economy job-which is to say, the expected employment for most of the female American workforce. No one in this video says, \"I hate my boss.\" 25 Most of them seem to be their own bosses, or women who have started their own businesses. None of them are over 35, none are overweight; all are cisgendered. The Women Who Work are cookie- cutter, team-leader, go-getter gals, business-school graduates perhaps, all with good hair and makeup, nothing real or pained about them. There's no evidence that any of them have struggled. They all seem to be upper-middle-class, no matter their color or ethnic background. They're from a fantasy world in which every woman can get what she wants if only she works hard enough. 26 In another video, called \"Women Who Encourage,\" two reddish-haired women remove a clutch handbag from a gift box and then-one sitting and one standing, each in pink tops with black trousers, their coppery locks wafting-look tenderly at someone off to the right of the camera. This is how working women in Ivanka's virtual universe encourage each other: by offering things that are bought (preferably from IvankaTrump .com), rather than by leading a walkout at their place of employment, say, or by supporting one another when it comes to claims of sexual harassment. On Ivanka's website, conflict never exists. 27 IvankaTrump.com does have a section called \"Wise Words\" (\"Nothing is impossible. The word itself says 'I'm possible'\"-Audrey Hepburn; or \"It's never too late to be what you might have been,\" wrongly attributed to George Eliot; or \"Challenges are opportunities\"-so anodyne it's not attributed to anyone.) But you'll never read anything here about processing chickens or serving up burgers or sewing jeans, or what it's like to be a secretary, a receptionist, a nurse, a hairdresser, a teacher, a saleswoman, a waitress, a bookkeeper, a cashier, or any of the other jobs at which most American women work. 28 IvankaTrump.com prefers to address style and fashion, what you can buy for work and what you should wear to work, rather than the substance of work. It includes tips on how to get promoted and tips for thinking like a Harvard Business School graduate; it includes pages about yoga for the workday, as well as about entertaining and lifestyle and exercise and what to eat and what to serve. So far, wages, discrimination, and sexual harassment have not been on the radar, not even in a Lean In -lite kind of way. That's not the purpose of the website. It should be hashtagged #womenwhobuy. 29 This is what's known today as \"femvertising.\" The best thing one can say about Ivanka's retail celebration of women is that all of the women in her ads are portrayed as doing things for other women-the campaign is positively sapphic. Like all femvertising, IvankaTrump.com soft-pedals harsh realities; everything for working women comes wrapped in the gauze of love and encouragement and uplift and cool, calm niceness. Nothing on her site has to do with women's empowerment, because empowerment is political, and the politics of female empowerment must naturally take on the bastions of male power, which Ivanka isn't likely to do. Before the election, \"Women Who Work\" was part of her branding scheme, but now it's been retooled as a political scheme for her father's administration. The scheme should be beneficial both to the administration and to the brand, but not necessarily to women who actually work. 30 * * * 31 Anyway, silly me: I thought women who worked looked like Roseanne Barr, whose late-1980s sitcom embodied all the working women I knew growing up. Roseanne's eponymous character worked in a plastics factory, was often unemployed, took a fast-food job, was a telemarketer and later a bartender, and at some point-a low point-worked as a hair sweeper at a beauty salon. And, of course, she was a waitress. This is what life was like for the working women where I grew up, in sooty New Jersey, and also, apparently, in Barr's own Salt Lake City. (It turns out that the real Roseanne Barr, who ran for president in 2012, is now a slimmed-down, styled-up, face-fixed, and committed Hillary Clinton-hater-but I'm talking about the TV character, not the woman.)

And if they didn't look like Roseanne, they were pert, exhausted office workers like Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Richards: put-upon, condescended to, and belittled by their boss and male co-workers. 32 In my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs. They didn't wear slim linen trousers and strappy heels and boxy pale cashmere V-necks to work, and they still don't. They wore stretch slacks and polyester blouses. They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?). And because so many women have to some degree internalized this oppressed version of self, Ivanka can seem like a role model. She is the working woman that the working women I knew in my youth may have dreamed they'd become when they first started to work. They thought perhaps they'd make enough money to have hair like that, teeth like that. Enough money, in other words, to be free of the grinding work they had to do just to get by. 36 * * * 37 So we gaze at the lovely Ivanka. How can we help it? She is an object of fascination. She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women. One of the things My Father has said about her illustrates precisely why Ivanka won't help women as a supposed presidential influencer. When asked, in the wake of the Roger Ailes scandal, how he'd feel if Ivanka were harassed at work, Trump replied that she would never allow that to happen: If a boss were foolish enough to bother her, she'd just go out and get a new job. 38 Because Ivanka Trump can do that. The rest of us can't. Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee of the 1970s-the one exceptional person who is hired and then used to prove that everything is fine for everyone else of their kind, when patently it is not. 39 Also, one has to remember the troupe of handmaids who make Ivanka's exceptional life possible. Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne? At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage. In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park. As she says, gesturing to the skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue and the whole sprawl of the green park: \"Not a bad view to wake up to.\" 42 Sometimes, women of this kind-pampered, raised to be unthinking and self-involved-can change and end up doing incredible things. But it's rare. And under the thumb of Donald Trump, as an extension of My Father, it's almost unimaginable. Women-so many of whom are underpaid, undervalued, disregarded, and abused-shouldn't think that they can put their fate into the hands of someone who, no matter how hard she's worked in her father's company, has no clue of what struggle really means. The fact that Ivanka is supposedly guiding women's policy shows just how little-not how much-My Father cares about it. 43 Editor's note : An earlier version of this article described Ivana Trump and her parents as Croatian. In fact, they are Czech. The text has been corrected. Listen to Amy Wilentz discuss Ivanka on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\nAs a child, Ivanka was a total doll, an appendage and accessory for My Father. She was a golden, green-eyed, blond-haired thing, sweet-faced, alert, self-conscious, and, at 9 or 10 years old, already sexualized in a gold-lamé, lace-hemmed minidress, white pumps, gold jewelry, and a small, gold-chained gilt purse, her hair styled, her eyes watchful. In photos from the time, she always holds hands with My Father, more like a date than a daughter, while her mother Ivana trails them in the background (as Melania usually does today). 18 My Father could never keep his hands off Ivanka. In so many pictures of the two-as a child but especially as she begins to emerge into adulthood-Trump has his hands possessively on her waist or hips. Often, she's sitting coquettishly, Lolita-ishly, on his lap. In one much-viewed photograph, he's holding her there with his hands on her hips (she in a miniskirt, long legs aimed toward the camera), and she's cupping his chin as if he were her own dear love. To the side is a gilt statue of two large copulating birds. 19 Donald Trump with his daughter Ivanka at the Maybelline presents 1991 Look of the Year at Plaza Hotel in New York City, September 3, 1991. (Globe Photos/ZumaPress) Trump, of course, once told an interviewer that it would be OK to refer to his daughter as \"a piece of ass.\" In a later interview, he said: \"You know who's one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. My daughter, Ivanka. She's six feet tall. She's got the best body.\" When asked on The View whether Ivanka would ever pose for Playboy , Trump replied: \"I don't think Ivanka would do that inside the magazine. Although she does have a very nice figure. I've said that if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her.\" He can't stop talking about her body. 20 And yet, objectified as she certainly has been by this great big blustering objectifier of women, Ivanka has managed to pick up a lot of My Father's game. She's studied Trump and knows what he likes. He doesn't go for bookish girls, so when she went to Choate-one of the country's most exclusive prep schools-she also began working as a model (getting her first cover shoot, at age 15, for Seventeen ). After all, models and actresses are the women My Father marries. Then, after proving to him that she was marriageable, she went on to try to show that she could be him as well, by working at the Trump Organization. To be the Trump daughter, you must be a living contradiction in terms. You have to be a tough, rip-roaring negotiator and deal-closer like My Father, but you also have to be a sexy, leggy, fuckable babe who doesn't give much trouble. You have to be a Trump and a target for Trump. 21 In my hometown, the women who worked smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits. No matter how much Ivanka talks about what a great parent My Father was, Trump-more available to her than to any of his other children-was still not very present. He called a lot. And he took her calls; she brags about this. He provided special treats, vacations, presents. She certainly knew that to a large degree he held the reins of her inheritance. But My Father said flat out that he didn't like to care for children; men who change diapers, he's opined, are \"acting like the wife.\" The day-to-day rearing of Ivanka and her two brothers was done by four people: two Irish nannies and Ivana Trump's Czech parents, Milos and Maria. As Bill Maher once said about Trump's kids, they're like his real-estate projects: He doesn't build 'em, but he slaps his name on 'em. 22 What this set of paternal behaviors seems to have wrought in Ivanka's character is a woman who looks at herself and other women via the male gaze. She sees herself through My Father's eyes. Look at her: Of course she's pretty and young and has a great smile. But she's also ultrafeminized-a walking advertisement. She's beyond us, better than us, like a thoroughbred. She's a virtual Miss Universe runner-up, a created feminine figure-unreal, fixed, sculpted, and styled, done up and made up, invented as a female object. 23 * * * 24 Like any good Trump, Ivanka has erected an empire atop this act of self-creation, in her case at IvankaTrump.com, a retail-cum-inspirational website where \"Women Who Work\" is a prominent channel. The video that introduces \"Women Who Work\" is a multicultural collage of 25-to-35-year-old women who choose to work and are figuring out how to make their careers blend with starting a family and keeping the home together. Not one of the women pictured says, \"I don't want to have children,\" and not one is working at a typical industrial Rust Belt, lower-level office, or service-economy job-which is to say, the expected employment for most of the female American workforce. No one in this video says, \"I hate my boss.\" 25 Most of them seem to be their own bosses, or women who have started their own businesses. None of them are over 35, none are overweight; all are cisgendered. The Women Who Work are cookie- cutter, team-leader, go-getter gals, business-school graduates perhaps, all with good hair and makeup, nothing real or pained about them. There's no evidence that any of them have struggled. They all seem to be upper-middle-class, no matter their color or ethnic background. They're from a fantasy world in which every woman can get what she wants if only she works hard enough. 26 In another video, called \"Women Who Encourage,\" two reddish-haired women remove a clutch handbag from a gift box and then-one sitting and one standing, each in pink tops with black trousers, their coppery locks wafting-look tenderly at someone off to the right of the camera. This is how working women in Ivanka's virtual universe encourage each other: by offering things that are bought (preferably from IvankaTrump .com), rather than by leading a walkout at their place of employment, say, or by supporting one another when it comes to claims of sexual harassment. On Ivanka's website, conflict never exists. 27 IvankaTrump.com does have a section called \"Wise Words\" (\"Nothing is impossible. The word itself says 'I'm possible'\"-Audrey Hepburn; or \"It's never too late to be what you might have been,\" wrongly attributed to George Eliot; or \"Challenges are opportunities\"-so anodyne it's not attributed to anyone.) But you'll never read anything here about processing chickens or serving up burgers or sewing jeans, or what it's like to be a secretary, a receptionist, a nurse, a hairdresser, a teacher, a saleswoman, a waitress, a bookkeeper, a cashier, or any of the other jobs at which most American women work. 28 IvankaTrump.com prefers to address style and fashion, what you can buy for work and what you should wear to work, rather than the substance of work. It includes tips on how to get promoted and tips for thinking like a Harvard Business School graduate; it includes pages about yoga for the workday, as well as about entertaining and lifestyle and exercise and what to eat and what to serve. So far, wages, discrimination, and sexual harassment have not been on the radar, not even in a Lean In -lite kind of way. That's not the purpose of the website. It should be hashtagged #womenwhobuy. 29 This is what's known today as \"femvertising.\" The best thing one can say about Ivanka's retail celebration of women is that all of the women in her ads are portrayed as doing things for other women-the campaign is positively sapphic. Like all femvertising, IvankaTrump.com soft-pedals harsh realities; everything for working women comes wrapped in the gauze of love and encouragement and uplift and cool, calm niceness. Nothing on her site has to do with women's empowerment, because empowerment is political, and the politics of female empowerment must naturally take on the bastions of male power, which Ivanka isn't likely to do. Before the election, \"Women Who Work\" was part of her branding scheme, but now it's been retooled as a political scheme for her father's administration. The scheme should be beneficial both to the administration and to the brand, but not necessarily to women who actually work. 30 * * * 31 Anyway, silly me: I thought women who worked looked like Roseanne Barr, whose late-1980s sitcom embodied all the working women I knew growing up. Roseanne's eponymous character worked in a plastics factory, was often unemployed, took a fast-food job, was a telemarketer and later a bartender, and at some point-a low point-worked as a hair sweeper at a beauty salon. And, of course, she was a waitress. This is what life was like for the working women where I grew up, in sooty New Jersey, and also, apparently, in Barr's own Salt Lake City.

They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?). And because so many women have to some degree internalized this oppressed version of self, Ivanka can seem like a role model. She is the working woman that the working women I knew in my youth may have dreamed they'd become when they first started to work. They thought perhaps they'd make enough money to have hair like that, teeth like that. Enough money, in other words, to be free of the grinding work they had to do just to get by. 36 * * * 37 So we gaze at the lovely Ivanka. How can we help it? She is an object of fascination. She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women. One of the things My Father has said about her illustrates precisely why Ivanka won't help women as a supposed presidential influencer. When asked, in the wake of the Roger Ailes scandal, how he'd feel if Ivanka were harassed at work, Trump replied that she would never allow that to happen: If a boss were foolish enough to bother her, she'd just go out and get a new job. 38 Because Ivanka Trump can do that. The rest of us can't. Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee of the 1970s-the one exceptional person who is hired and then used to prove that everything is fine for everyone else of their kind, when patently it is not. 39 Also, one has to remember the troupe of handmaids who make Ivanka's exceptional life possible. Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne? At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage. In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park. As she says, gesturing to the skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue and the whole sprawl of the green park: \"Not a bad view to wake up to.\" 42 Sometimes, women of this kind-pampered, raised to be unthinking and self-involved-can change and end up doing incredible things. But it's rare. And under the thumb of Donald Trump, as an extension of My Father, it's almost unimaginable. Women-so many of whom are underpaid, undervalued, disregarded, and abused-shouldn't think that they can put their fate into the hands of someone who, no matter how hard she's worked in her father's company, has no clue of what struggle really means. The fact that Ivanka is supposedly guiding women's policy shows just how little-not how much-My Father cares about it. 43 Editor's note : An earlier version of this article described Ivana Trump and her parents as Croatian. In fact, they are Czech. The text has been corrected. Listen to Amy Wilentz discuss Ivanka on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\nDonald Trump with his daughter Ivanka at the Maybelline presents 1991 Look of the Year at Plaza Hotel in New York City, September 3, 1991. (Globe Photos/ZumaPress)\n\nTrump, of course, once told an interviewer that it would be OK to refer to his daughter as \"a piece of ass.\" In a later interview, he said: \"You know who's one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. My daughter, Ivanka. She's six feet tall. She's got the best body.\" When asked on The View whether Ivanka would ever pose for Playboy , Trump replied: \"I don't think Ivanka would do that inside the magazine. Although she does have a very nice figure. I've said that if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her.\" He can't stop talking about her body. 20 And yet, objectified as she certainly has been by this great big blustering objectifier of women, Ivanka has managed to pick up a lot of My Father's game. She's studied Trump and knows what he likes. He doesn't go for bookish girls, so when she went to Choate-one of the country's most exclusive prep schools-she also began working as a model (getting her first cover shoot, at age 15, for Seventeen ). After all, models and actresses are the women My Father marries. Then, after proving to him that she was marriageable, she went on to try to show that she could be him as well, by working at the Trump Organization. To be the Trump daughter, you must be a living contradiction in terms. You have to be a tough, rip-roaring negotiator and deal-closer like My Father, but you also have to be a sexy, leggy, fuckable babe who doesn't give much trouble. You have to be a Trump and a target for Trump. 21 In my hometown, the women who worked smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits. No matter how much Ivanka talks about what a great parent My Father was, Trump-more available to her than to any of his other children-was still not very present. He called a lot. And he took her calls; she brags about this. He provided special treats, vacations, presents. She certainly knew that to a large degree he held the reins of her inheritance. But My Father said flat out that he didn't like to care for children; men who change diapers, he's opined, are \"acting like the wife.\" The day-to-day rearing of Ivanka and her two brothers was done by four people: two Irish nannies and Ivana Trump's Czech parents, Milos and Maria. As Bill Maher once said about Trump's kids, they're like his real-estate projects: He doesn't build 'em, but he slaps his name on 'em. 22 What this set of paternal behaviors seems to have wrought in Ivanka's character is a woman who looks at herself and other women via the male gaze. She sees herself through My Father's eyes. Look at her: Of course she's pretty and young and has a great smile. But she's also ultrafeminized-a walking advertisement. She's beyond us, better than us, like a thoroughbred. She's a virtual Miss Universe runner-up, a created feminine figure-unreal, fixed, sculpted, and styled, done up and made up, invented as a female object. 23 * * * 24 Like any good Trump, Ivanka has erected an empire atop this act of self-creation, in her case at IvankaTrump.com, a retail-cum-inspirational website where \"Women Who Work\" is a prominent channel. The video that introduces \"Women Who Work\" is a multicultural collage of 25-to-35-year-old women who choose to work and are figuring out how to make their careers blend with starting a family and keeping the home together. Not one of the women pictured says, \"I don't want to have children,\" and not one is working at a typical industrial Rust Belt, lower-level office, or service-economy job-which is to say, the expected employment for most of the female American workforce. No one in this video says, \"I hate my boss.\" 25 Most of them seem to be their own bosses, or women who have started their own businesses. None of them are over 35, none are overweight; all are cisgendered. The Women Who Work are cookie- cutter, team-leader, go-getter gals, business-school graduates perhaps, all with good hair and makeup, nothing real or pained about them. There's no evidence that any of them have struggled. They all seem to be upper-middle-class, no matter their color or ethnic background. They're from a fantasy world in which every woman can get what she wants if only she works hard enough. 26 In another video, called \"Women Who Encourage,\" two reddish-haired women remove a clutch handbag from a gift box and then-one sitting and one standing, each in pink tops with black trousers, their coppery locks wafting-look tenderly at someone off to the right of the camera. This is how working women in Ivanka's virtual universe encourage each other: by offering things that are bought (preferably from IvankaTrump .com), rather than by leading a walkout at their place of employment, say, or by supporting one another when it comes to claims of sexual harassment. On Ivanka's website, conflict never exists. 27 IvankaTrump.com does have a section called \"Wise Words\" (\"Nothing is impossible. The word itself says 'I'm possible'\"-Audrey Hepburn; or \"It's never too late to be what you might have been,\" wrongly attributed to George Eliot; or \"Challenges are opportunities\"-so anodyne it's not attributed to anyone.) But you'll never read anything here about processing chickens or serving up burgers or sewing jeans, or what it's like to be a secretary, a receptionist, a nurse, a hairdresser, a teacher, a saleswoman, a waitress, a bookkeeper, a cashier, or any of the other jobs at which most American women work. 28 IvankaTrump.com prefers to address style and fashion, what you can buy for work and what you should wear to work, rather than the substance of work. It includes tips on how to get promoted and tips for thinking like a Harvard Business School graduate; it includes pages about yoga for the workday, as well as about entertaining and lifestyle and exercise and what to eat and what to serve. So far, wages, discrimination, and sexual harassment have not been on the radar, not even in a Lean In -lite kind of way. That's not the purpose of the website. It should be hashtagged #womenwhobuy. 29 This is what's known today as \"femvertising.\" The best thing one can say about Ivanka's retail celebration of women is that all of the women in her ads are portrayed as doing things for other women-the campaign is positively sapphic. Like all femvertising, IvankaTrump.com soft-pedals harsh realities; everything for working women comes wrapped in the gauze of love and encouragement and uplift and cool, calm niceness. Nothing on her site has to do with women's empowerment, because empowerment is political, and the politics of female empowerment must naturally take on the bastions of male power, which Ivanka isn't likely to do. Before the election, \"Women Who Work\" was part of her branding scheme, but now it's been retooled as a political scheme for her father's administration. The scheme should be beneficial both to the administration and to the brand, but not necessarily to women who actually work. 30 * * * 31 Anyway, silly me: I thought women who worked looked like Roseanne Barr, whose late-1980s sitcom embodied all the working women I knew growing up. Roseanne's eponymous character worked in a plastics factory, was often unemployed, took a fast-food job, was a telemarketer and later a bartender, and at some point-a low point-worked as a hair sweeper at a beauty salon. And, of course, she was a waitress. This is what life was like for the working women where I grew up, in sooty New Jersey, and also, apparently, in Barr's own Salt Lake City. (It turns out that the real Roseanne Barr, who ran for president in 2012, is now a slimmed-down, styled-up, face-fixed, and committed Hillary Clinton-hater-but I'm talking about the TV character, not the woman.) And if they didn't look like Roseanne, they were pert, exhausted office workers like Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Richards: put-upon, condescended to, and belittled by their boss and male co-workers. 32 In my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs. They didn't wear slim linen trousers and strappy heels and boxy pale cashmere V-necks to work, and they still don't. They wore stretch slacks and polyester blouses. They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations.

Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?).

She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women.

Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne? At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage. In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park. As she says, gesturing to the skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue and the whole sprawl of the green park: \"Not a bad view to wake up to.\" 42 Sometimes, women of this kind-pampered, raised to be unthinking and self-involved-can change and end up doing incredible things. But it's rare. And under the thumb of Donald Trump, as an extension of My Father, it's almost unimaginable. Women-so many of whom are underpaid, undervalued, disregarded, and abused-shouldn't think that they can put their fate into the hands of someone who, no matter how hard she's worked in her father's company, has no clue of what struggle really means. The fact that Ivanka is supposedly guiding women's policy shows just how little-not how much-My Father cares about it. 43 Editor's note : An earlier version of this article described Ivana Trump and her parents as Croatian. In fact, they are Czech. The text has been corrected. Listen to Amy Wilentz discuss Ivanka on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\nIn my hometown, the women who worked smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits.\n\nNo matter how much Ivanka talks about what a great parent My Father was, Trump-more available to her than to any of his other children-was still not very present. He called a lot. And he took her calls; she brags about this. He provided special treats, vacations, presents. She certainly knew that to a large degree he held the reins of her inheritance. But My Father said flat out that he didn't like to care for children; men who change diapers, he's opined, are \"acting like the wife.\" The day-to-day rearing of Ivanka and her two brothers was done by four people: two Irish nannies and Ivana Trump's Czech parents, Milos and Maria. As Bill Maher once said about Trump's kids, they're like his real-estate projects: He doesn't build 'em, but he slaps his name on 'em. 22 What this set of paternal behaviors seems to have wrought in Ivanka's character is a woman who looks at herself and other women via the male gaze. She sees herself through My Father's eyes. Look at her: Of course she's pretty and young and has a great smile. But she's also ultrafeminized-a walking advertisement. She's beyond us, better than us, like a thoroughbred. She's a virtual Miss Universe runner-up, a created feminine figure-unreal, fixed, sculpted, and styled, done up and made up, invented as a female object. 23 * * * 24 Like any good Trump, Ivanka has erected an empire atop this act of self-creation, in her case at IvankaTrump.com, a retail-cum-inspirational website where \"Women Who Work\" is a prominent channel. The video that introduces \"Women Who Work\" is a multicultural collage of 25-to-35-year-old women who choose to work and are figuring out how to make their careers blend with starting a family and keeping the home together. Not one of the women pictured says, \"I don't want to have children,\" and not one is working at a typical industrial Rust Belt, lower-level office, or service-economy job-which is to say, the expected employment for most of the female American workforce. No one in this video says, \"I hate my boss.\" 25 Most of them seem to be their own bosses, or women who have started their own businesses. None of them are over 35, none are overweight; all are cisgendered. The Women Who Work are cookie- cutter, team-leader, go-getter gals, business-school graduates perhaps, all with good hair and makeup, nothing real or pained about them. There's no evidence that any of them have struggled. They all seem to be upper-middle-class, no matter their color or ethnic background. They're from a fantasy world in which every woman can get what she wants if only she works hard enough. 26 In another video, called \"Women Who Encourage,\" two reddish-haired women remove a clutch handbag from a gift box and then-one sitting and one standing, each in pink tops with black trousers, their coppery locks wafting-look tenderly at someone off to the right of the camera. This is how working women in Ivanka's virtual universe encourage each other: by offering things that are bought (preferably from IvankaTrump .com), rather than by leading a walkout at their place of employment, say, or by supporting one another when it comes to claims of sexual harassment. On Ivanka's website, conflict never exists. 27 IvankaTrump.com does have a section called \"Wise Words\" (\"Nothing is impossible. The word itself says 'I'm possible'\"-Audrey Hepburn; or \"It's never too late to be what you might have been,\" wrongly attributed to George Eliot; or \"Challenges are opportunities\"-so anodyne it's not attributed to anyone.) But you'll never read anything here about processing chickens or serving up burgers or sewing jeans, or what it's like to be a secretary, a receptionist, a nurse, a hairdresser, a teacher, a saleswoman, a waitress, a bookkeeper, a cashier, or any of the other jobs at which most American women work. 28 IvankaTrump.com prefers to address style and fashion, what you can buy for work and what you should wear to work, rather than the substance of work. It includes tips on how to get promoted and tips for thinking like a Harvard Business School graduate; it includes pages about yoga for the workday, as well as about entertaining and lifestyle and exercise and what to eat and what to serve. So far, wages, discrimination, and sexual harassment have not been on the radar, not even in a Lean In -lite kind of way. That's not the purpose of the website. It should be hashtagged #womenwhobuy. 29 This is what's known today as \"femvertising.\" The best thing one can say about Ivanka's retail celebration of women is that all of the women in her ads are portrayed as doing things for other women-the campaign is positively sapphic. Like all femvertising, IvankaTrump.com soft-pedals harsh realities; everything for working women comes wrapped in the gauze of love and encouragement and uplift and cool, calm niceness. Nothing on her site has to do with women's empowerment, because empowerment is political, and the politics of female empowerment must naturally take on the bastions of male power, which Ivanka isn't likely to do. Before the election, \"Women Who Work\" was part of her branding scheme, but now it's been retooled as a political scheme for her father's administration. The scheme should be beneficial both to the administration and to the brand, but not necessarily to women who actually work. 30 * * * 31 Anyway, silly me: I thought women who worked looked like Roseanne Barr, whose late-1980s sitcom embodied all the working women I knew growing up. Roseanne's eponymous character worked in a plastics factory, was often unemployed, took a fast-food job, was a telemarketer and later a bartender, and at some point-a low point-worked as a hair sweeper at a beauty salon. And, of course, she was a waitress. This is what life was like for the working women where I grew up, in sooty New Jersey, and also, apparently, in Barr's own Salt Lake City. (It turns out that the real Roseanne Barr, who ran for president in 2012, is now a slimmed-down, styled-up, face-fixed, and committed Hillary Clinton-hater-but I'm talking about the TV character, not the woman.) And if they didn't look like Roseanne, they were pert, exhausted office workers like Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Richards: put-upon, condescended to, and belittled by their boss and male co-workers. 32 In my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs. They didn't wear slim linen trousers and strappy heels and boxy pale cashmere V-necks to work, and they still don't. They wore stretch slacks and polyester blouses. They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?). And because so many women have to some degree internalized this oppressed version of self, Ivanka can seem like a role model. She is the working woman that the working women I knew in my youth may have dreamed they'd become when they first started to work. They thought perhaps they'd make enough money to have hair like that, teeth like that. Enough money, in other words, to be free of the grinding work they had to do just to get by. 36 * * * 37 So we gaze at the lovely Ivanka. How can we help it? She is an object of fascination. She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women. One of the things My Father has said about her illustrates precisely why Ivanka won't help women as a supposed presidential influencer. When asked, in the wake of the Roger Ailes scandal, how he'd feel if Ivanka were harassed at work, Trump replied that she would never allow that to happen: If a boss were foolish enough to bother her, she'd just go out and get a new job. 38 Because Ivanka Trump can do that. The rest of us can't. Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee of the 1970s-the one exceptional person who is hired and then used to prove that everything is fine for everyone else of their kind, when patently it is not. 39 Also, one has to remember the troupe of handmaids who make Ivanka's exceptional life possible. Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne?

They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?). And because so many women have to some degree internalized this oppressed version of self, Ivanka can seem like a role model. She is the working woman that the working women I knew in my youth may have dreamed they'd become when they first started to work. They thought perhaps they'd make enough money to have hair like that, teeth like that. Enough money, in other words, to be free of the grinding work they had to do just to get by. 36 * * * 37 So we gaze at the lovely Ivanka. How can we help it? She is an object of fascination. She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women. One of the things My Father has said about her illustrates precisely why Ivanka won't help women as a supposed presidential influencer. When asked, in the wake of the Roger Ailes scandal, how he'd feel if Ivanka were harassed at work, Trump replied that she would never allow that to happen: If a boss were foolish enough to bother her, she'd just go out and get a new job. 38 Because Ivanka Trump can do that. The rest of us can't. Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee of the 1970s-the one exceptional person who is hired and then used to prove that everything is fine for everyone else of their kind, when patently it is not. 39 Also, one has to remember the troupe of handmaids who make Ivanka's exceptional life possible. Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne? At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage. In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park. As she says, gesturing to the skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue and the whole sprawl of the green park: \"Not a bad view to wake up to.\" 42 Sometimes, women of this kind-pampered, raised to be unthinking and self-involved-can change and end up doing incredible things. But it's rare. And under the thumb of Donald Trump, as an extension of My Father, it's almost unimaginable. Women-so many of whom are underpaid, undervalued, disregarded, and abused-shouldn't think that they can put their fate into the hands of someone who, no matter how hard she's worked in her father's company, has no clue of what struggle really means. The fact that Ivanka is supposedly guiding women's policy shows just how little-not how much-My Father cares about it. 43 Editor's note : An earlier version of this article described Ivana Trump and her parents as Croatian. In fact, they are Czech. The text has been corrected. Listen to Amy Wilentz discuss Ivanka on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\nLike any good Trump, Ivanka has erected an empire atop this act of self-creation, in her case at IvankaTrump.com, a retail-cum-inspirational website where \"Women Who Work\" is a prominent channel. The video that introduces \"Women Who Work\" is a multicultural collage of 25-to-35-year-old women who choose to work and are figuring out how to make their careers blend with starting a family and keeping the home together. Not one of the women pictured says, \"I don't want to have children,\" and not one is working at a typical industrial Rust Belt, lower-level office, or service-economy job-which is to say, the expected employment for most of the female American workforce. No one in this video says, \"I hate my boss.\" 25 Most of them seem to be their own bosses, or women who have started their own businesses. None of them are over 35, none are overweight; all are cisgendered. The Women Who Work are cookie- cutter, team-leader, go-getter gals, business-school graduates perhaps, all with good hair and makeup, nothing real or pained about them. There's no evidence that any of them have struggled. They all seem to be upper-middle-class, no matter their color or ethnic background. They're from a fantasy world in which every woman can get what she wants if only she works hard enough. 26 In another video, called \"Women Who Encourage,\" two reddish-haired women remove a clutch handbag from a gift box and then-one sitting and one standing, each in pink tops with black trousers, their coppery locks wafting-look tenderly at someone off to the right of the camera. This is how working women in Ivanka's virtual universe encourage each other: by offering things that are bought (preferably from IvankaTrump .com), rather than by leading a walkout at their place of employment, say, or by supporting one another when it comes to claims of sexual harassment. On Ivanka's website, conflict never exists. 27 IvankaTrump.com does have a section called \"Wise Words\" (\"Nothing is impossible. The word itself says 'I'm possible'\"-Audrey Hepburn; or \"It's never too late to be what you might have been,\" wrongly attributed to George Eliot; or \"Challenges are opportunities\"-so anodyne it's not attributed to anyone.) But you'll never read anything here about processing chickens or serving up burgers or sewing jeans, or what it's like to be a secretary, a receptionist, a nurse, a hairdresser, a teacher, a saleswoman, a waitress, a bookkeeper, a cashier, or any of the other jobs at which most American women work. 28 IvankaTrump.com prefers to address style and fashion, what you can buy for work and what you should wear to work, rather than the substance of work. It includes tips on how to get promoted and tips for thinking like a Harvard Business School graduate; it includes pages about yoga for the workday, as well as about entertaining and lifestyle and exercise and what to eat and what to serve. So far, wages, discrimination, and sexual harassment have not been on the radar, not even in a Lean In -lite kind of way. That's not the purpose of the website. It should be hashtagged #womenwhobuy. 29 This is what's known today as \"femvertising.\" The best thing one can say about Ivanka's retail celebration of women is that all of the women in her ads are portrayed as doing things for other women-the campaign is positively sapphic. Like all femvertising, IvankaTrump.com soft-pedals harsh realities; everything for working women comes wrapped in the gauze of love and encouragement and uplift and cool, calm niceness. Nothing on her site has to do with women's empowerment, because empowerment is political, and the politics of female empowerment must naturally take on the bastions of male power, which Ivanka isn't likely to do. Before the election, \"Women Who Work\" was part of her branding scheme, but now it's been retooled as a political scheme for her father's administration. The scheme should be beneficial both to the administration and to the brand, but not necessarily to women who actually work. 30 * * * 31 Anyway, silly me: I thought women who worked looked like Roseanne Barr, whose late-1980s sitcom embodied all the working women I knew growing up. Roseanne's eponymous character worked in a plastics factory, was often unemployed, took a fast-food job, was a telemarketer and later a bartender, and at some point-a low point-worked as a hair sweeper at a beauty salon. And, of course, she was a waitress. This is what life was like for the working women where I grew up, in sooty New Jersey, and also, apparently, in Barr's own Salt Lake City. (It turns out that the real Roseanne Barr, who ran for president in 2012, is now a slimmed-down, styled-up, face-fixed, and committed Hillary Clinton-hater-but I'm talking about the TV character, not the woman.) And if they didn't look like Roseanne, they were pert, exhausted office workers like Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Richards: put-upon, condescended to, and belittled by their boss and male co-workers. 32 In my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs.

They didn't wear slim linen trousers and strappy heels and boxy pale cashmere V-necks to work, and they still don't. They wore stretch slacks and polyester blouses. They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?). And because so many women have to some degree internalized this oppressed version of self, Ivanka can seem like a role model. She is the working woman that the working women I knew in my youth may have dreamed they'd become when they first started to work. They thought perhaps they'd make enough money to have hair like that, teeth like that. Enough money, in other words, to be free of the grinding work they had to do just to get by. 36 * * * 37 So we gaze at the lovely Ivanka. How can we help it? She is an object of fascination. She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women. One of the things My Father has said about her illustrates precisely why Ivanka won't help women as a supposed presidential influencer. When asked, in the wake of the Roger Ailes scandal, how he'd feel if Ivanka were harassed at work, Trump replied that she would never allow that to happen: If a boss were foolish enough to bother her, she'd just go out and get a new job. 38 Because Ivanka Trump can do that. The rest of us can't. Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee of the 1970s-the one exceptional person who is hired and then used to prove that everything is fine for everyone else of their kind, when patently it is not. 39 Also, one has to remember the troupe of handmaids who make Ivanka's exceptional life possible. Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne? At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage. In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park. As she says, gesturing to the skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue and the whole sprawl of the green park: \"Not a bad view to wake up to.\" 42 Sometimes, women of this kind-pampered, raised to be unthinking and self-involved-can change and end up doing incredible things. But it's rare. And under the thumb of Donald Trump, as an extension of My Father, it's almost unimaginable. Women-so many of whom are underpaid, undervalued, disregarded, and abused-shouldn't think that they can put their fate into the hands of someone who, no matter how hard she's worked in her father's company, has no clue of what struggle really means. The fact that Ivanka is supposedly guiding women's policy shows just how little-not how much-My Father cares about it. 43 Editor's note : An earlier version of this article described Ivana Trump and her parents as Croatian. In fact, they are Czech. The text has been corrected. Listen to Amy Wilentz discuss Ivanka on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\nIvankaTrump.com does have a section called \"Wise Words\" (\"Nothing is impossible. The word itself says 'I'm possible'\"-Audrey Hepburn; or \"It's never too late to be what you might have been,\" wrongly attributed to George Eliot; or \"Challenges are opportunities\"-so anodyne it's not attributed to anyone.) But you'll never read anything here about processing chickens or serving up burgers or sewing jeans, or what it's like to be a secretary, a receptionist, a nurse, a hairdresser, a teacher, a saleswoman, a waitress, a bookkeeper, a cashier, or any of the other jobs at which most American women work. 28 IvankaTrump.com prefers to address style and fashion, what you can buy for work and what you should wear to work, rather than the substance of work. It includes tips on how to get promoted and tips for thinking like a Harvard Business School graduate; it includes pages about yoga for the workday, as well as about entertaining and lifestyle and exercise and what to eat and what to serve. So far, wages, discrimination, and sexual harassment have not been on the radar, not even in a Lean In -lite kind of way. That's not the purpose of the website. It should be hashtagged #womenwhobuy. 29 This is what's known today as \"femvertising.\" The best thing one can say about Ivanka's retail celebration of women is that all of the women in her ads are portrayed as doing things for other women-the campaign is positively sapphic. Like all femvertising, IvankaTrump.com soft-pedals harsh realities; everything for working women comes wrapped in the gauze of love and encouragement and uplift and cool, calm niceness. Nothing on her site has to do with women's empowerment, because empowerment is political, and the politics of female empowerment must naturally take on the bastions of male power, which Ivanka isn't likely to do. Before the election, \"Women Who Work\" was part of her branding scheme, but now it's been retooled as a political scheme for her father's administration. The scheme should be beneficial both to the administration and to the brand, but not necessarily to women who actually work. 30 * * * 31 Anyway, silly me: I thought women who worked looked like Roseanne Barr, whose late-1980s sitcom embodied all the working women I knew growing up. Roseanne's eponymous character worked in a plastics factory, was often unemployed, took a fast-food job, was a telemarketer and later a bartender, and at some point-a low point-worked as a hair sweeper at a beauty salon. And, of course, she was a waitress. This is what life was like for the working women where I grew up, in sooty New Jersey, and also, apparently, in Barr's own Salt Lake City. (It turns out that the real Roseanne Barr, who ran for president in 2012, is now a slimmed-down, styled-up, face-fixed, and committed Hillary Clinton-hater-but I'm talking about the TV character, not the woman.)

In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park. As she says, gesturing to the skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue and the whole sprawl of the green park: \"Not a bad view to wake up to.\" 42 Sometimes, women of this kind-pampered, raised to be unthinking and self-involved-can change and end up doing incredible things. But it's rare. And under the thumb of Donald Trump, as an extension of My Father, it's almost unimaginable. Women-so many of whom are underpaid, undervalued, disregarded, and abused-shouldn't think that they can put their fate into the hands of someone who, no matter how hard she's worked in her father's company, has no clue of what struggle really means. The fact that Ivanka is supposedly guiding women's policy shows just how little-not how much-My Father cares about it. 43 Editor's note : An earlier version of this article described Ivana Trump and her parents as Croatian. In fact, they are Czech. The text has been corrected. Listen to Amy Wilentz discuss Ivanka on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\n* * * 31 Anyway, silly me: I thought women who worked looked like Roseanne Barr, whose late-1980s sitcom embodied all the working women I knew growing up. Roseanne's eponymous character worked in a plastics factory, was often unemployed, took a fast-food job, was a telemarketer and later a bartender, and at some point-a low point-worked as a hair sweeper at a beauty salon. And, of course, she was a waitress. This is what life was like for the working women where I grew up, in sooty New Jersey, and also, apparently, in Barr's own Salt Lake City. (It turns out that the real Roseanne Barr, who ran for president in 2012, is now a slimmed-down, styled-up, face-fixed, and committed Hillary Clinton-hater-but I'm talking about the TV character, not the woman.) And if they didn't look like Roseanne, they were pert, exhausted office workers like Mary Tyler Moore's Mary Richards: put-upon, condescended to, and belittled by their boss and male co-workers. 32 In my hometown and in other places where I've lived, women who work didn't have the money or time for Botox and blow-outs. They didn't wear slim linen trousers and strappy heels and boxy pale cashmere V-necks to work, and they still don't. They wore stretch slacks and polyester blouses. They didn't work exclusively in streamlined offices behind empty Scandinavian-made desks with no books or files or mess of any kind, and with only other good-looking people their age. 33 Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee, the one person who is hired to prove that everything is fine. Instead, the women I knew worked in crappy small businesses run by bad male bosses, or were hopeful, downtrodden receptionists or bookkeepers or office managers in male-dominated companies, or were wives who cooked the books for dentists and lawyers in fluorescent-lit offices with Formica-topped desks-women who smoked cigarettes and had bad teeth and no benefits, and who didn't \"love, laugh, and encourage\" as their major preoccupations. They wouldn't appreciate the little dictums on \"Women Who Work,\" like \"Everything you need is already inside you,\" or \"If you can believe, anything is possible.\" Imagine feeding this pabulum to Men Who Work, to start-up teams or traders on Wall Street. No one would ever presume to address young businessmen in the 21st century as if they were debutantes or Brownies on a 1950s television show. 34 Yet Ivanka, and My Father too, come from a line of women who worked. Her paternal grandmother , Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, came to the United States from Scotland and worked as a maid for at least four years, while her paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, born in Germany, actually became the matriarch of the family business in the United States after her husband died prematurely. That real-estate company was called Elizabeth Trump & Son, and the son was Fred Jr.-Donald's father. (Elizabeth Trump & Son eventually became the Trump Organization.) Ivanka's paternal aunt is Maryanne Barry, a respected federal judge. Her mother Ivana, while possibly laughable, never stopped working after her divorce from Trump. Among the many hats she wore: jewelry designer, advice columnist, newspaper publisher (in Croatia), publisher of the magazine Ivana's Living in Style , novelist (one title is For Love Alone ), television host (of Ivana Young Man -say it out loud), and investor in failed real-estate ventures. You cannot make her up. 35 Ivanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?). And because so many women have to some degree internalized this oppressed version of self, Ivanka can seem like a role model. She is the working woman that the working women I knew in my youth may have dreamed they'd become when they first started to work. They thought perhaps they'd make enough money to have hair like that, teeth like that. Enough money, in other words, to be free of the grinding work they had to do just to get by. 36 * * * 37 So we gaze at the lovely Ivanka. How can we help it? She is an object of fascination. She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women. One of the things My Father has said about her illustrates precisely why Ivanka won't help women as a supposed presidential influencer. When asked, in the wake of the Roger Ailes scandal, how he'd feel if Ivanka were harassed at work, Trump replied that she would never allow that to happen: If a boss were foolish enough to bother her, she'd just go out and get a new job. 38 Because Ivanka Trump can do that. The rest of us can't. Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee of the 1970s-the one exceptional person who is hired and then used to prove that everything is fine for everyone else of their kind, when patently it is not. 39 Also, one has to remember the troupe of handmaids who make Ivanka's exceptional life possible. Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne? At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational.

Ivanka is like the token black or Latino employee of the 1970s-the one exceptional person who is hired and then used to prove that everything is fine for everyone else of their kind, when patently it is not. 39 Also, one has to remember the troupe of handmaids who make Ivanka's exceptional life possible. Every time you see one of those gorgeous, sleek pictures of Ivanka and her kids looking like the young Elizabeth II and the princes and princess (only better-looking and more fashionable), imagine for yourself, outside the frame, the numerous Filipino or Irish or Czech nannies and handlers and cooks and cleaners who make all that ease possible. Do those women have health care, maternity leave, retirement benefits, even citizenship? 40 Who is Ivanka more like: the Duchess of Cambridge, or Roseanne? At least Kate Middleton doesn't pretend to be in charge of women's issues in the United Kingdom; she's purely aspirational. In The Trump Card , Ivanka argues-unaware of the laughter the assertion sets off in readers-that having been born rich and entitled is more a burden and disability than it is a privilege and advantage. In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park. As she says, gesturing to the skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue and the whole sprawl of the green park: \"Not a bad view to wake up to.\" 42 Sometimes, women of this kind-pampered, raised to be unthinking and self-involved-can change and end up doing incredible things. But it's rare. And under the thumb of Donald Trump, as an extension of My Father, it's almost unimaginable. Women-so many of whom are underpaid, undervalued, disregarded, and abused-shouldn't think that they can put their fate into the hands of someone who, no matter how hard she's worked in her father's company, has no clue of what struggle really means. The fact that Ivanka is supposedly guiding women's policy shows just how little-not how much-My Father cares about it. 43 Editor's note : An earlier version of this article described Ivana Trump and her parents as Croatian. In fact, they are Czech. The text has been corrected. Listen to Amy Wilentz discuss Ivanka on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\nIvanka herself is an idealized working woman, with her pink clothes, sweet babies, perfect hair and jewelry, and her dedication to entertaining, décor, and a streamlined metrosexual husband. The image she projects is purposefully unthreatening to men (would you threaten men if your father were Donald Trump?). And because so many women have to some degree internalized this oppressed version of self, Ivanka can seem like a role model. She is the working woman that the working women I knew in my youth may have dreamed they'd become when they first started to work. They thought perhaps they'd make enough money to have hair like that, teeth like that. Enough money, in other words, to be free of the grinding work they had to do just to get by. 36 * * * 37 So we gaze at the lovely Ivanka. How can we help it? She is an object of fascination. She's exceptional in every way: exceptionally rich, exceptionally entitled, exceptionally placed, exceptionally well-groomed, exceptionally secure in her position. Simply because she's exceptional, she is implausible as a policy-maker for women. One of the things My Father has said about her illustrates precisely why Ivanka won't help women as a supposed presidential influencer. When asked, in the wake of the Roger Ailes scandal, how he'd feel if Ivanka were harassed at work, Trump replied that she would never allow that to happen: If a boss were foolish enough to bother her, she'd just go out and get a new job. 38 Because Ivanka Trump can do that.

In the 2003 documentary Born Rich made by her friend Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, Ivanka makes a few cameo appearances and has one scene where she shows Johnson her tweenage bedroom in Trump Tower. 41 \"OK, this is a room,\" she says, wearing a twinset sweater, her hair then brown, \"that probably nobody has walked into for the past 10-plus years.\" Laughing and half-embarrassed, Ivanka very charmingly guides us through her \"time capsule,\" like Jackie Kennedy touring the White House: the Madonna clock; a landscape that she calls \"my interesting attempt at color painting\"; the closet door with posters that she dubs her \"homage to Poison and Mötley Crüe\"; the Beverly Hills 90210 posters; and \"the Bon Jovi sort of wall.\" Pretty average fare for a kid of that era, until you see the lavender chiffon drapery around the brass canopy daybed, and you discover that this now-unvisited room is on the 68th floor, with an expansive view of Central Park.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

She's the author of several award-winning books, most recently Farewell Fred Voodoo: A Letter from Haiti. This interview has been edited and condensed. Listen to Amy Wilentz on the Start Making Sense podcast. Jon Wiener: Jared Kushner has serious legal problems stemming from the Russia investigations, but they have not prevented him from going out. Amy Wilentz: Jared and Ivanka went to a party given by Lally Weymouth on July 4th weekend in the Hamptons. Lally Weymouth is a socialite, but she's also the senior associate editor of The Washington Post , because of nepotism. Her mother was the editor and publisher of The Washington Post : Katherine Graham. Republicans were there: In addition to Ivanka and Jared, Kellyanne Conway, and David Koch of the Koch brothers. Also Dina Powell, the deputy national-security adviser in the Trump White House. On the other hand, Chuck Schumer was also there, along with top Democratic funders George Soros and Stephen Spielberg. Various members of the global financial community were also there-all at this party, sipping champagne together, side by side-making you wonder who's running the world. JW: But we are told that the Democrats and Republicans have never been farther apart, that we have the most polarizing president in history, that there's been a complete breakdown of bipartisanship in Washington, DC. Jared Kushner Kushner and Bannon Team Up to Privatize the War in Afghanistan Tim Shorrock AW: I call this sort of event \"biparty-san.\" This is the supra-national elite at work. I hate to sound like a conspiracy theorist, and I'm not one, but they do what they do because it's in their interest. And their interests transcend the divisions in Congress. They're beyond patriotism and nationalism; they're functioning in another world, a bigger world. The Trumps are a part of this because they run a real-estate conglomerate that has global interests. The Russian oligarchs are also part of this. They've known each other for a long time. A person like Natalia Veselnitskaya, the lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr. and the rest of the crew, is attached to many of these influential supra-national figures in Russia. I think that's why Don Jr., having grown up in that kind of world, doesn't even understand what it means to have Russians offer you a thing of value like information on Hillary Clinton.

In addition to the reports about his presence at that meeting with the Russian promising dirt on Clinton, there was the story that McClatchy published , that the Justice Department and the House and Senate intelligence committees are looking into whether the Trump campaign's digital team coordinated with the Russian government during the 2016 election. The head of the Trump campaign's digital team, for some reason, was Jared Kushner. What was all this about? AW: This is about Russian hackers using bots and trolls. Apparently, there are ways to insert fake news into social media in a broad way. The question is whether they coordinated the use of those techniques with the Trump campaign, and Jared, to target specific demographic areas that were crucial to winning the number of votes in the Electoral College required to put Trump over the top. Current Issue View our current issue JW: I don't quite understand why Jared is the expert on digital and Internet technology here-but that was his job in the campaign. AW: Yes, Jared is often doing things that he's not capable of doing. But nonetheless, if you're the head of something, you're responsible for it. So if that happened under his watch it would be a severe problem for him. It is also a problem for him that he was at that meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya. In fact, the only reason we know about that meeting is because Donald Trump Junior made the mistake of inviting Jared, and Jared made the mistake of going. Jared had omitted that information when he applied for a security clearance. Then, when he revised his security-clearance papers, he had to put this meeting down. That is how it came to light. JW: Meanwhile, Ivanka is her father's favorite, but her star continues to dim for the rest of us. AW: The problem is the way she conducts her business around the world. It's in the garment industry, and the global garment industry all over the world is what we call a shonda , a shameful thing. So it's not only Ivanka who's a shameful employer, but since she's championing women's rights in the United States and violating them around the globe in her factories, it's dimming her star. But I also think she's in hiding. I think that she sees that her husband is a target right now of justifiable anger on the part a lot of people she has known through her life. And her brother Don Jr. is a target as well. I guess she'd rather be out of sight for this moment. JW: Her other brother, Eric, is also in trouble, for giving money raised by his charity to the Trump organization instead of to children's cancer. And there's one other Trump kid: Tiffany. But Tiffany is never in the news. AW: That's because she's the smart one.\n\nListen to Amy Wilentz on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\nJon Wiener: Jared Kushner has serious legal problems stemming from the Russia investigations, but they have not prevented him from going out. Amy Wilentz: Jared and Ivanka went to a party given by Lally Weymouth on July 4th weekend in the Hamptons. Lally Weymouth is a socialite, but she's also the senior associate editor of The Washington Post , because of nepotism. Her mother was the editor and publisher of The Washington Post : Katherine Graham. Republicans were there: In addition to Ivanka and Jared, Kellyanne Conway, and David Koch of the Koch brothers. Also Dina Powell, the deputy national-security adviser in the Trump White House. On the other hand, Chuck Schumer was also there, along with top Democratic funders George Soros and Stephen Spielberg. Various members of the global financial community were also there-all at this party, sipping champagne together, side by side-making you wonder who's running the world. JW: But we are told that the Democrats and Republicans have never been farther apart, that we have the most polarizing president in history, that there's been a complete breakdown of bipartisanship in Washington, DC. Jared Kushner Kushner and Bannon Team Up to Privatize the War in Afghanistan Tim Shorrock AW: I call this sort of event \"biparty-san.\" This is the supra-national elite at work. I hate to sound like a conspiracy theorist, and I'm not one, but they do what they do because it's in their interest. And their interests transcend the divisions in Congress. They're beyond patriotism and nationalism; they're functioning in another world, a bigger world. The Trumps are a part of this because they run a real-estate conglomerate that has global interests. The Russian oligarchs are also part of this. They've known each other for a long time. A person like Natalia Veselnitskaya, the lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr. and the rest of the crew, is attached to many of these influential supra-national figures in Russia. I think that's why Don Jr., having grown up in that kind of world, doesn't even understand what it means to have Russians offer you a thing of value like information on Hillary Clinton.

JW: Her other brother, Eric, is also in trouble, for giving money raised by his charity to the Trump organization instead of to children's cancer. And there's one other Trump kid: Tiffany. But Tiffany is never in the news. AW: That's because she's the smart one.\n\nJW: Her other brother, Eric, is also in trouble, for giving money raised by his charity to the Trump organization instead of to children's cancer.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

But while Ivanka markets her new guide to success for \"Women Who Work,\" the women working for her in China , producing slippers for her elite apparel brand, face a work-life balance that smacks more of Oliver Twist than Lean In . Earlier this year, the US-based China Labor Watch (CLW) rubbed some of the gloss off the heavily marketed, obsessively scrutinized Ivanka brand when a team of undercover investigators infiltrated the facilities of a supplier to Ivanka's shoe brand, Huajian, in Guangdong and Jiangxi Provinces. They uncovered shocking brutality , including evidence of wage theft and forced labor, with nonstop production shifts that lasted well over the legal standard. Some employees were reportedly \"tricked into the factory with inaccurate recruiting advertisements.\" Intense production quotas required an amount of labor that was said to be physically impossible to meet even with overtime; work hours ran up to 15 hours per day, and managers often shorted workers on pay for forced overtime hours. Under the May production schedule-which CLW says included orders from Trump's company-workers reportedly \"worked for over 350 hours\" with only two holidays off. If fatigued workers tried to request extra rest time, CLW claims, \"the management would decline their request and use large order volumes as an excuse.\" Those too exhausted to continue often ended up getting fired just for incurring three unexcused absences, which the management evidently considered \"voluntarily terminat[ing] their employment, in which case no pay or compensation would be given.\" The payment schedule was also stalled for weeks, so a worker who quit might have to forgo their last month's wages. Investigators observed that women workers faced more aggressive wage theft and penalties than male colleagues. Additionally, student apprentices were misclassified as regular workers and pressed into excessive, underpaid shift work. Even by China's standards, the labor conditions were wildly out of step with the luxurious image of the brands known to contract with Huajian, including Guess and Marc Fisher -high-end labels that claim to follow high corporate-ethics standards-and the signature label of a presidential daughter and global feminist figurehead.

Adding insult to injury, bosses allegedly sometimes forced workers to engage in payroll forgery in order to cover up systematic underpayment of wages. CLW cites video footage showing a factory trainer forcing new hires to sign \"dozens of pay stubs with different names.\" CLW's investigation did not specifically target Trump's brand; rather, the organization hopes its findings draw the public's attention toward the systemic issues of structural abuse and exploitation across China's apparel industry, and the complicity of Western fashion brands. The dehumanizing treatment and lack of accountability-which researchers observed and documented with interviews and photography-led CLW to deem Huajian one of the worst workplaces they had ever encountered. None of the 20 brands known to have sourced their production at Huajian have directly responded to CLW's queries, the group says, though some companies have issued tepid statements to the press, promising to investigate the claims. Anecdotally, CLW says it has heard the factory eased up its work schedules since the scandal broke, and one aggrieved former worker said he was awarded some backpay. But outside inspectors and media apparently remain blocked from further investigating the factory. It is unclear whether the Trump brand's previous pending orders have been canceled. \"Because Ivanka Trump is the most high-profile brand in the investigation...she is setting a bad example,\" says CLW Executive Director Li Qiang, noting that Huajian was \"the worst among all the factories that we've investigated in the past few years.\" The investigation reached international headlines after three CLW investigators were arrested and detained by local authorities in May , and held in isolation for weeks as family members endured harassment and intimidation. The wife of investigator Hua Haifeng, Deng Guilian, wrote in June to Ivanka Trump pleading for her to intervene. After Hua's disappearance, several agents entered her house without a warrant, Deng recalled, confiscated her phone and subjected her to hours of intimidating interrogation, refusing to release her until she signed off on a police report. One officer \"lectured me on my thinking, asking me not to get in touch with strangers...not to accept anyone's help.... I was to report to them if any stranger got in touch with me.\" CLW says Deng's letter never received any response, though the investigators were eventually released on bail in late June (now awaiting trial, they have been ordered not to speak with media, according to CLW). Nor has anyone in the US government publicly commented on Huajian, though some anonymous US officials suggested recently to Reuters that the labor controversy was being used as a geopolitical ploy between Washington and Beijing. But CLW says it has no other motives than simply improving the workers' conditions. Li also wants to know why Deng's outrage went unanswered by an ostensible \"feminist\" of such influence . So Huajian remains one of many hidden undersides of the Trump family empire. Though the allegations of labor abuse are endemic and not unique to Trump's brand, the President's name is indelibly linked to allegations of massive labor abuse, along with the violent suppression of advocates who are giving Western brands the wrong kind of publicity. CLW believes Ivanka's corporation has a responsibility to use her public platform to make an example of cleaning up her company's supply chain. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has denounced China's human-rights record and showcased Ivanka as a champion of human and women's rights. Li quipped, \"Before Trump's administration starts to criticize other countries' human rights problems, they need to improve Ivanka Trump's factory's supply chain conditions first.... Because, of course, workers rights are part of human rights.\" In light of Trump's eagerness to rival China's economic dominance, Qiang suggested another approach to free trade for the president: \"Speaking of bringing jobs back to America as Trump says, he might as well bring back these slave labor jobs that are in Ivanka Trump's factories, if he wants.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the US-based China Labor Watch (CLW) rubbed some of the gloss off the heavily marketed, obsessively scrutinized Ivanka brand when a team of undercover investigators infiltrated the facilities of a supplier to Ivanka's shoe brand, Huajian, in Guangdong and Jiangxi Provinces.

One officer \"lectured me on my thinking, asking me not to get in touch with strangers...not to accept anyone's help.... I was to report to them if any stranger got in touch with me.\" CLW says Deng's letter never received any response, though the investigators were eventually released on bail in late June (now awaiting trial, they have been ordered not to speak with media, according to CLW). Nor has anyone in the US government publicly commented on Huajian, though some anonymous US officials suggested recently to Reuters that the labor controversy was being used as a geopolitical ploy between Washington and Beijing. But CLW says it has no other motives than simply improving the workers' conditions. Li also wants to know why Deng's outrage went unanswered by an ostensible \"feminist\" of such influence . So Huajian remains one of many hidden undersides of the Trump family empire. Though the allegations of labor abuse are endemic and not unique to Trump's brand, the President's name is indelibly linked to allegations of massive labor abuse, along with the violent suppression of advocates who are giving Western brands the wrong kind of publicity. CLW believes Ivanka's corporation has a responsibility to use her public platform to make an example of cleaning up her company's supply chain. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has denounced China's human-rights record and showcased Ivanka as a champion of human and women's rights.

Adding insult to injury, bosses allegedly sometimes forced workers to engage in payroll forgery in order to cover up systematic underpayment of wages. CLW cites video footage showing a factory trainer forcing new hires to sign \"dozens of pay stubs with different names.\" CLW's investigation did not specifically target Trump's brand; rather, the organization hopes its findings draw the public's attention toward the systemic issues of structural abuse and exploitation across China's apparel industry, and the complicity of Western fashion brands. The dehumanizing treatment and lack of accountability-which researchers observed and documented with interviews and photography-led CLW to deem Huajian one of the worst workplaces they had ever encountered. None of the 20 brands known to have sourced their production at Huajian have directly responded to CLW's queries, the group says, though some companies have issued tepid statements to the press, promising to investigate the claims. Anecdotally, CLW says it has heard the factory eased up its work schedules since the scandal broke, and one aggrieved former worker said he was awarded some backpay.

But while Ivanka markets her new guide to success for \"Women Who Work,\" the women working for her in China , producing slippers for her elite apparel brand, face a work-life balance that smacks more of Oliver Twist than Lean In . Earlier this year, the US-based China Labor Watch (CLW) rubbed some of the gloss off the heavily marketed, obsessively scrutinized Ivanka brand when a team of undercover investigators infiltrated the facilities of a supplier to Ivanka's shoe brand, Huajian, in Guangdong and Jiangxi Provinces. They uncovered shocking brutality , including evidence of wage theft and forced labor, with nonstop production shifts that lasted well over the legal standard. Some employees were reportedly \"tricked into the factory with inaccurate recruiting advertisements.\" Intense production quotas required an amount of labor that was said to be physically impossible to meet even with overtime; work hours ran up to 15 hours per day, and managers often shorted workers on pay for forced overtime hours. Under the May production schedule-which CLW says included orders from Trump's company-workers reportedly \"worked for over 350 hours\" with only two holidays off. If fatigued workers tried to request extra rest time, CLW claims, \"the management would decline their request and use large order volumes as an excuse.\" Those too exhausted to continue often ended up getting fired just for incurring three unexcused absences, which the management evidently considered \"voluntarily terminat[ing] their employment, in which case no pay or compensation would be given.\" The payment schedule was also stalled for weeks, so a worker who quit might have to forgo their last month's wages. Investigators observed that women workers faced more aggressive wage theft and penalties than male colleagues. Additionally, student apprentices were misclassified as regular workers and pressed into excessive, underpaid shift work. Even by China's standards, the labor conditions were wildly out of step with the luxurious image of the brands known to contract with Huajian, including Guess and Marc Fisher -high-end labels that claim to follow high corporate-ethics standards-and the signature label of a presidential daughter and global feminist figurehead.

CLW cites video footage showing a factory trainer forcing new hires to sign \"dozens of pay stubs with different names.\" CLW's investigation did not specifically target Trump's brand; rather, the organization hopes its findings draw the public's attention toward the systemic issues of structural abuse and exploitation across China's apparel industry, and the complicity of Western fashion brands. The dehumanizing treatment and lack of accountability-which researchers observed and documented with interviews and photography-led CLW to deem Huajian one of the worst workplaces they had ever encountered. None of the 20 brands known to have sourced their production at Huajian have directly responded to CLW's queries, the group says, though some companies have issued tepid statements to the press, promising to investigate the claims. Anecdotally, CLW says it has heard the factory eased up its work schedules since the scandal broke, and one aggrieved former worker said he was awarded some backpay. But outside inspectors and media apparently remain blocked from further investigating the factory. It is unclear whether the Trump brand's previous pending orders have been canceled. \"Because Ivanka Trump is the most high-profile brand in the investigation...she is setting a bad example,\" says CLW Executive Director Li Qiang, noting that Huajian was \"the worst among all the factories that we've investigated in the past few years.\" The investigation reached international headlines after three CLW investigators were arrested and detained by local authorities in May , and held in isolation for weeks as family members endured harassment and intimidation. The wife of investigator Hua Haifeng, Deng Guilian, wrote in June to Ivanka Trump pleading for her to intervene. After Hua's disappearance, several agents entered her house without a warrant, Deng recalled, confiscated her phone and subjected her to hours of intimidating interrogation, refusing to release her until she signed off on a police report. One officer \"lectured me on my thinking, asking me not to get in touch with strangers...not to accept anyone's help.... I was to report to them if any stranger got in touch with me.\" CLW says Deng's letter never received any response, though the investigators were eventually released on bail in late June (now awaiting trial, they have been ordered not to speak with media, according to CLW). Nor has anyone in the US government publicly commented on Huajian, though some anonymous US officials suggested recently to Reuters that the labor controversy was being used as a geopolitical ploy between Washington and Beijing. But CLW says it has no other motives than simply improving the workers' conditions. Li also wants to know why Deng's outrage went unanswered by an ostensible \"feminist\" of such influence . So Huajian remains one of many hidden undersides of the Trump family empire. Though the allegations of labor abuse are endemic and not unique to Trump's brand, the President's name is indelibly linked to allegations of massive labor abuse, along with the violent suppression of advocates who are giving Western brands the wrong kind of publicity. CLW believes Ivanka's corporation has a responsibility to use her public platform to make an example of cleaning up her company's supply chain. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has denounced China's human-rights record and showcased Ivanka as a champion of human and women's rights. Li quipped, \"Before Trump's administration starts to criticize other countries' human rights problems, they need to improve Ivanka Trump's factory's supply chain conditions first.... Because, of course, workers rights are part of human rights.\" In light of Trump's eagerness to rival China's economic dominance, Qiang suggested another approach to free trade for the president: \"Speaking of bringing jobs back to America as Trump says, he might as well bring back these slave labor jobs that are in Ivanka Trump's factories, if he wants.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the US-based China Labor Watch (CLW) rubbed some of the gloss off the heavily marketed, obsessively scrutinized Ivanka brand when a team of undercover investigators infiltrated the facilities of a supplier to Ivanka's shoe brand, Huajian, in Guangdong and Jiangxi Provinces.

One officer \"lectured me on my thinking, asking me not to get in touch with strangers...not to accept anyone's help.... I was to report to them if any stranger got in touch with me.\" CLW says Deng's letter never received any response, though the investigators were eventually released on bail in late June (now awaiting trial, they have been ordered not to speak with media, according to CLW). Nor has anyone in the US government publicly commented on Huajian, though some anonymous US officials suggested recently to Reuters that the labor controversy was being used as a geopolitical ploy between Washington and Beijing. But CLW says it has no other motives than simply improving the workers' conditions. Li also wants to know why Deng's outrage went unanswered by an ostensible \"feminist\" of such influence . So Huajian remains one of many hidden undersides of the Trump family empire. Though the allegations of labor abuse are endemic and not unique to Trump's brand, the President's name is indelibly linked to allegations of massive labor abuse, along with the violent suppression of advocates who are giving Western brands the wrong kind of publicity. CLW believes Ivanka's corporation has a responsibility to use her public platform to make an example of cleaning up her company's supply chain. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has denounced China's human-rights record and showcased Ivanka as a champion of human and women's rights. Li quipped, \"Before Trump's administration starts to criticize other countries' human rights problems, they need to improve Ivanka Trump's factory's supply chain conditions first.... Because, of course, workers rights are part of human rights.\" In light of Trump's eagerness to rival China's economic dominance, Qiang suggested another approach to free trade for the president: \"Speaking of bringing jobs back to America as Trump says, he might as well bring back these slave labor jobs that are in Ivanka Trump's factories, if he wants.\"\n\nAdding insult to injury, bosses allegedly sometimes forced workers to engage in payroll forgery in order to cover up systematic underpayment of wages. CLW cites video footage showing a factory trainer forcing new hires to sign \"dozens of pay stubs with different names.\" CLW's investigation did not specifically target Trump's brand; rather, the organization hopes its findings draw the public's attention toward the systemic issues of structural abuse and exploitation across China's apparel industry, and the complicity of Western fashion brands. The dehumanizing treatment and lack of accountability-which researchers observed and documented with interviews and photography-led CLW to deem Huajian one of the worst workplaces they had ever encountered. None of the 20 brands known to have sourced their production at Huajian have directly responded to CLW's queries, the group says, though some companies have issued tepid statements to the press, promising to investigate the claims. Anecdotally, CLW says it has heard the factory eased up its work schedules since the scandal broke, and one aggrieved former worker said he was awarded some backpay. But outside inspectors and media apparently remain blocked from further investigating the factory. It is unclear whether the Trump brand's previous pending orders have been canceled. \"Because Ivanka Trump is the most high-profile brand in the investigation...she is setting a bad example,\" says CLW Executive Director Li Qiang, noting that Huajian was \"the worst among all the factories that we've investigated in the past few years.\" The investigation reached international headlines after three CLW investigators were arrested and detained by local authorities in May , and held in isolation for weeks as family members endured harassment and intimidation.

      "text": "Ivanka Trump's Tricky Comeback Tour\n\nPoor Ivanka! Just when she thought she was out, they pulled her back in . I am referring, of course, to her recent appearance at the civil fraud trial of her father, Donald Trump, which has been ongoing in Manhattan for six weeks. The trial stems from the New York attorney general Letitia James's contention that the former President-along with his two eldest sons, and other Trump Organization executives-fraudulently inflated his net worth, and the value of his real-estate assets on financial documents, which helped them secure favorable loans for the company.\n\nIvanka narrowly wriggled out of being a defendant herself: she stopped working for the Trump Organization, where she had been an executive vice-president, in 2017-which, as luck would have it, places her outside the statute of limitations for the trial's purposes. She also did her best to avoid getting called as a government witness, with her lawyers claiming that she would \"suffer undue hardship\" if she were \"required to testify at trial in New York in the middle of a school week.\" (Ivanka lives in Florida and has three young children.) But, despite this heartstrings-pulling nod to the spectre of motherhood, the claim was rejected by the prosecution. And so there she was on Wednesday morning, striding into the New York State Supreme Courthouse, the picture of staid elegance in a navy suit and coat, a Chanel handbag in her hand, her hair long and smooth down her back, a slight smile on her face (which, if one were to believe the Daily Mail , might have been newly if tastefully nipped and tucked for the occasion). She was, apparently, ready to like it or lump it.\n\nIn the years since her father was dragged, kicking and screaming, out of office, Ivanka-the cleverest, arguably least embarrassing member of her clan-has attempted, with some effort, to rebuild her life away from her previous power bases. Before the Trump Presidency, in her native New York, she ran a successful apparel business, and was also a front-facing pillar of her father's real-estate company and his heiress apparent. After her father was elected, she and her husband, the butter-wouldn't-melt-in-his-mouth real-estate scion Jared Kushner, moved to D.C., where they served as advisers in the Trump Administration, with Ivanka becoming a kind of First Lady manquée in the frequent absence of her stepmother, Melania. But, unfortunately for Ivanka, the latter period, with its shocking and chaotic January 6th coda , proved disastrous to the reputation she had worked to establish in the former. Once a member of New York's élite social set and a staple of the charity-gala circuit, she was suddenly persona non grata, her toxic association with her father too hot to handle for her generally liberal cohort, none of whom seemed to want to be photographed at a party with a woman who wrote, after the Capitol riot, in a since-deleted tweet, that the insurrectionists were \"American patriots.\" (In the same tweet, she called for an end to the violence and asked these patriots to \"be peaceful.\")\n\nAnd so, after leaving the White House, Ivanka and Kushner relocated to Miami. The family lives in the gated community of Indian Creek Village, known as \"billionaire bunker,\" where, to once again reference the Ivanka-obsessed Daily Mail , they seem to have been spending their days pleasantly enough, wakeboarding , boating , and going to synagogue . (Before marrying Kushner, who was raised Modern Orthodox, Ivanka converted to Judaism.) And yet, for all the considerable comforts of high-end beach-side living, this still felt like a self-imposed exile. Ivanka, despite occasionally speaking out against her dad-in 2016, she referred to his comments in the \"Access Hollywood\" tape as \" inappropriate and offensive ,\" and, more recently, she told Congress that she doesn't believe the 2020 election was stolen-had chosen to ensconce herself in MAGA -pilled Florida. As far as one could tell, she appeared reconciled to never being invited back to the A-list events she was once a shoo-in for, like Anna Wintour's Met Gala.\n\nLately, however, there have been signs that Ivanka is hoping for a return to the fold. In late 2022, she released a statement in which she officially distanced herself from her father, announcing that she will not be part of his 2024 Presidential campaign and would prefer to lead a \"private life\" that's not \"involved in politics.\" And an even more pointed sign that change was afoot came a couple of weeks ago, and not just from any quarters, but from the most powerful woman in America: Kim Kardashian. In an October 22nd Instagram post , in which Kardashian called herself \"so blessed to have hit the jackpot of friends,\" the reality-TV star threw up a number of pictures of her best gal pals getting down at her forty-third birthday party in Beverly Hills, including not just her famous sisters and social mainstays such as the model Hailey Bieber and Jeff Bezos's fiancée, Lauren Sanchez, but also Ivanka, looking as polished as ever in a sparkly white two-piece top-and-skirt set. This was mysterious-it's still not exactly clear to me what Kardashian's angle is here-but it seemed undeniable that a P.R. campaign was under way, especially when, a week later, Kardashian posted an Instagram story wishing Ivanka a happy birthday, calling her \"the most thoughtful sweetest soul.\" In one posted picture, Ivanka and Kardashian were sitting near a fireplace, the two women's respective daughters, Arabella and North, on their laps, with, for good measure, a fluffy white dog in Arabella's arms.

      "text": "Ivanka Trump's Tricky Comeback Tour\n\nPoor Ivanka! Just when she thought she was out, they pulled her back in . I am referring, of course, to her recent appearance at the civil fraud trial of her father, Donald Trump, which has been ongoing in Manhattan for six weeks. The trial stems from the New York attorney general Letitia James's contention that the former President-along with his two eldest sons, and other Trump Organization executives-fraudulently inflated his net worth, and the value of his real-estate assets on financial documents, which helped them secure favorable loans for the company.\n\nIvanka narrowly wriggled out of being a defendant herself: she stopped working for the Trump Organization, where she had been an executive vice-president, in 2017-which, as luck would have it, places her outside the statute of limitations for the trial's purposes. She also did her best to avoid getting called as a government witness, with her lawyers claiming that she would \"suffer undue hardship\" if she were \"required to testify at trial in New York in the middle of a school week.\" (Ivanka lives in Florida and has three young children.) But, despite this heartstrings-pulling nod to the spectre of motherhood, the claim was rejected by the prosecution. And so there she was on Wednesday morning, striding into the New York State Supreme Courthouse, the picture of staid elegance in a navy suit and coat, a Chanel handbag in her hand, her hair long and smooth down her back, a slight smile on her face (which, if one were to believe the Daily Mail , might have been newly if tastefully nipped and tucked for the occasion). She was, apparently, ready to like it or lump it.\n\nIn the years since her father was dragged, kicking and screaming, out of office, Ivanka-the cleverest, arguably least embarrassing member of her clan-has attempted, with some effort, to rebuild her life away from her previous power bases. Before the Trump Presidency, in her native New York, she ran a successful apparel business, and was also a front-facing pillar of her father's real-estate company and his heiress apparent. After her father was elected, she and her husband, the butter-wouldn't-melt-in-his-mouth real-estate scion Jared Kushner, moved to D.C., where they served as advisers in the Trump Administration, with Ivanka becoming a kind of First Lady manquée in the frequent absence of her stepmother, Melania. But, unfortunately for Ivanka, the latter period, with its shocking and chaotic January 6th coda , proved disastrous to the reputation she had worked to establish in the former. Once a member of New York's élite social set and a staple of the charity-gala circuit, she was suddenly persona non grata, her toxic association with her father too hot to handle for her generally liberal cohort, none of whom seemed to want to be photographed at a party with a woman who wrote, after the Capitol riot, in a since-deleted tweet, that the insurrectionists were \"American patriots.\" (In the same tweet, she called for an end to the violence and asked these patriots to \"be peaceful.\")\n\nAnd so, after leaving the White House, Ivanka and Kushner relocated to Miami. The family lives in the gated community of Indian Creek Village, known as \"billionaire bunker,\" where, to once again reference the Ivanka-obsessed Daily Mail , they seem to have been spending their days pleasantly enough, wakeboarding , boating , and going to synagogue . (Before marrying Kushner, who was raised Modern Orthodox, Ivanka converted to Judaism.) And yet, for all the considerable comforts of high-end beach-side living, this still felt like a self-imposed exile. Ivanka, despite occasionally speaking out against her dad-in 2016, she referred to his comments in the \"Access Hollywood\" tape as \" inappropriate and offensive ,\" and, more recently, she told Congress that she doesn't believe the 2020 election was stolen-had chosen to ensconce herself in MAGA -pilled Florida. As far as one could tell, she appeared reconciled to never being invited back to the A-list events she was once a shoo-in for, like Anna Wintour's Met Gala.\n\nLately, however, there have been signs that Ivanka is hoping for a return to the fold. In late 2022, she released a statement in which she officially distanced herself from her father, announcing that she will not be part of his 2024 Presidential campaign and would prefer to lead a \"private life\" that's not \"involved in politics.\" And an even more pointed sign that change was afoot came a couple of weeks ago, and not just from any quarters, but from the most powerful woman in America: Kim Kardashian. In an October 22nd Instagram post , in which Kardashian called herself \"so blessed to have hit the jackpot of friends,\" the reality-TV star threw up a number of pictures of her best gal pals getting down at her forty-third birthday party in Beverly Hills, including not just her famous sisters and social mainstays such as the model Hailey Bieber and Jeff Bezos's fiancée, Lauren Sanchez, but also Ivanka, looking as polished as ever in a sparkly white two-piece top-and-skirt set. This was mysterious-it's still not exactly clear to me what Kardashian's angle is here-but it seemed undeniable that a P.R. campaign was under way, especially when, a week later, Kardashian posted an Instagram story wishing Ivanka a happy birthday, calling her \"the most thoughtful sweetest soul.\" In one posted picture, Ivanka and Kardashian were sitting near a fireplace, the two women's respective daughters, Arabella and North, on their laps, with, for good measure, a fluffy white dog in Arabella's arms. (\"Our babies are so small here,\" Kardashian added, with a crying-face emoji.)\n\nWe are so back, the posts seemed to suggest. But not so fast.

      "text": "Ivanka Trump's Shockingly Smooth Case of Selective Amnesia\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Judge Arthur F. Engoron dismissed Ivanka Trump from the witness stand, and the New York attorney general's office rested its civil fraud case against Donald Trump , his two eldest sons , and the Trump Organization. Ivanka, who was once a Trump Organization executive herself, as well as a White House official and the owner of an apparel business, strode out of the courtroom, and, soon after, cheers and jeers could be heard coming from outside the New York County Courthouse, where a small crowd of onlookers had gathered.\n\nIn September, 2022, when the state attorney general, Letitia James, first brought the civil charges against the Trumps, Ivanka was a co-defendant. In June of this year, however, an appeals court dismissed her from the case on the ground that the claims against her were barred by the state's statute of limitations. (She left the Trump Organization in 2017 to serve as an aide in the White House, alongside her husband, Jared Kushner .) After making repeated efforts to avoid testifying, or to delay her appearance, she appeared at the trial as a reluctant witness for the government. In many ways, her nearly five hours of testimony encapsulated the entire trial so far, in substance if not in style.\n\nThe substantive outcome of the day was that the attorney general's office used Ivanka's appearance to buttress its argument that the Trump Organization used fraudulent Statements of Financial Condition, which greatly exaggerated Trump's net worth, to help the company get favorable deals from banks and other financial institutions. Louis Solomon, a senior lawyer in the attorney general's office, took Ivanka through a series of documents and e-mails relating to two Trump properties that she worked on extensively: the Doral golf resort in Miami, which the Trump Organization bought and redeveloped, and the government-owned Old Post Office building in Washington, D.C., which the Trump Organization leased and converted into a luxury hotel.\n\nMuch of the trial, which has been running for the past six weeks, has consisted of similarly laborious exercises involving other witnesses, including Ivanka's father and two brothers. But, if the basic format of Wednesday's proceedings were familiar, the contrast between Ivanka's conduct and that of her family members was glaring. From start to finish, she was polite to a fault. She smiled. She even swapped a lighthearted remark or two with Judge Engoron, who is partial to a bit of banter. All in all, she put on an impressive show, but one that ultimately rested on an acute case of selective amnesia.\n\nTime after time, Solomon asked Ivanka whether she recalled certain communications or recognized certain exhibits. And, time after time, Ivanka said that she didn't. Many of these communications involved Deutsche Bank, which gave the Trump Organization low-cost loans to finance the redevelopment of Doral and the conversion of the Old Post Office building. Solomon produced a November, 2011, document in which the securities division of Deutsche Bank, which operated separately from the private-wealth division, offered to supply a loan for Doral at an interest rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus eight per cent. Ivanka said she didn't recall having seen these terms. Solomon then produced a December, 2011, e-mail from Rosemary Vrablic, a senior executive in the private-wealth department at Deutsche, which contained an offer to provide two loans for the Doral project at interest rates equal to LIBOR plus two per cent and 2.5 per cent. It doesn't take a finance wiz to figure out that LIBOR plus two per cent is a much better interest rate than LIBOR plus eight per cent.\n\nIvanka said she recalled that she \"received high-level terms\" from Vrablic, but she said she didn't remember this particular proposal. Solomon then produced an e-mail that Ivanka sent to other Trump executives shortly after Vrablic e-mailed her, in which she forwarded the loan terms that the banker had offered. \"It doesn't get better than this. Let's discuss ASAP,\" the e-mail said. After reading it out, Solomon asked the witness: \"Does this refresh your memory on whether you thought this was a good proposal for the Trump Organization?\" Ivanka replied: \"I think what we ended up doing was slightly different. But, yes, I thought generally the deal was positive.\"\n\nA key difference between the two loan offers from Deutsche Bank was that the one from the private-wealth department required a personal guarantee from Trump and the one from the securities division didn't. Solomon brought up an e-mail that Ivanka received from Jason Greenblatt, a lawyer at the Trump Organization, in which Greenblatt pointed out that the offer from Vrablic required Trump to personally guarantee the loans and maintain a minimum net worth of three billion dollars, which \"would seem to me to be a problem?\" as Greenblatt put it. Ivanka replied: \"That we have known from day one. We wanted to get a great rate and the only way to get proceeds/term and principle where we want them is to guarantee the deal.\" Solomon asked the witness if she recalled writing this email. No, she replied.\n\nThe point of all this was to try and demonstrate that Trump received favorable loan terms based, at least in part, on the net worth he claimed in his Statements of Financial Condition. Ivanka said she had nothing to do with the preparation of these statements and knew little about them. But Solomon also produced a copy of the final loan agreement with Deutsche Bank from 2012. It included a minimum net-worth requirement of $2.5 billion and noted that Trump had supplied the bank with a copy of his financial statements.\n\nOccasionally, Ivanka was able to conjure up some more detailed memories. She remembered that the original letter informing her that the Trumps could purchase Doral had appeared as she was just about to have a baby. She also recalled, at some length, a 2011 meeting in Washington, D.C., with the federal General Services Administration, at which she, her father, and other Trump executives presented their vision for redeveloping the Old Post Office building. But she insisted that she didn't remember discussing anything about Trump's financial statements with the G.S.A. \"When I ask a question, she doesn't remember,\" a frustrated Solomon remarked to Judge Engoron. \"The witness does have a recollection, Your Honor!\"\n\nEven the attorney general seemed impressed by the smoothness of Ivanka's performance on the witness stand. \"Ivanka Trump was cordial, she was disciplined, she was controlled, and she was very courteous,\" James told reporters outside the courthouse. However, the attorney general went on, the documentary evidence had clearly shown that the witness was \"involved in negotiating and securing loans, favorable loans, for the benefit of the Trump Organization, for Mr. Trump and her brothers and for herself. . . . The documents do not lie. The numbers do not lie.\"\n\nIn a case built heavily on documents, that is the challenge facing Trump's defense team. Starting on Monday, they will attempt to convince the court that the documentary evidence, although voluminous, doesn't prove that Trump and the Trump Organization acted with fraudulent intent or that the bogus valuations contained in the Statements of Financial Condition imposed any financial harm on the banks and other financial companies that received them.\n\nBefore Ivanka left the witness stand, Jesus Suarez, a member of the Trump defense team, made a start on this endeavor by cross-examining her about the Trump Organization's relationship with Deutsche Bank. Suarez produced an e-mail in which Vrablic asked Ivanka if she would feature in one of its promotional videos. Ivanka said she couldn't remember whether she did the video, but added that Deutsche was constantly saying \"how much they appreciated our relationship.\" Suarez also brought up a meeting between Donald Trump and Deutsche's then co-C.E.O. Anshu Jain at Trump Tower, in March, 2013. Ivanka seemed to have a clear recollection of this occasion. She claimed that Jain encouraged the Trumps to do more business with the bank. When Suarez asked her how her father reacted to the meeting, she said, \"He was very positive. It was a very nice meeting.\" ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Ivanka Trump Wrote a Painfully Oblivious Book for Basically No One\n\nIvanka Trump, a daughter of and aide to the man whose election drove women to mount the largest protest in American history , has published a new book. It's about how women can best achieve personal satisfaction and professional success. This is an ill-advised endeavor, in theory. In practice, it is an even worse idea than it seems.\n\nIn the preface to the book-titled \"Women Who Work,\" after an \"initiative\" she launched, in 2014-Ivanka emphasizes that she wrote it before Donald Trump became President. She has since announced that she will donate the profits and refrain from publicizing the book \"through a promotional tour or media appearances,\" in the hopes of avoiding the appearance of ethical conflicts . (Instead, she has been shilling for the book on Twitter , where she has nearly four million followers.) Nonetheless, it is immediately obvious that circumstances have gotten entirely away from her. When Ivanka published her first book, \" The Trump Card ,\" she was twenty-eight, and her air of oblivious diligence was a reasonable fit for her position as a hardworking heiress, the favored child of a celebrity tycoon. Now that her father is the President and she has assumed a post in the White House, it feels downright perverse to watch her devote breathless attention to the self-actualization processes at work in the lives of wealthy women while studiously ignoring the political forces that shape even those lives.\n\n\"Women Who Work\" is mostly composed of artless jargon (\"All women benefit immeasurably by architecting their lives\") and inspirational quotes you might find by Googling \"inspirational quotes.\" Her exhortations feel even emptier than usual in light of Trump's stated policy goals. \"We must fight for ourselves, for our rights not just as workers but also as women,\" Ivanka writes, and, elsewhere, \"Honor yourself by exploring the kind of life you deserve.\" The imagined audience for the book is so rarefied that Ivanka confidently calls paying bills and buying groceries \"not enormously impactful\" to one's daily productivity. Her nannies are mentioned twice, if you count the acknowledgments; no other household help is alluded to at all. On the book's second-to-last page, she finally, briefly mentions the need for paid leave and affordable childcare.\n\nThe notion that Ivanka's reticence on political issues conceals an innate goodness and a sort of strategic genius that can only be deployed behind the scenes has been crumbling since November. As I wrote last year in a piece about her previous book, Ivanka possesses a type of beauty that often passes as moral uprightness; she speaks carefully, making some portion of her audience believe that she must act carefully, too. But \"Women Who Work\" should put an end to the idea that Ivanka is particularly self-aware. In the book's third paragraph, she assesses her father's Presidential run by saying, \"I have grown tremendously as a person.\" Later, she laments not \"treating myself to a massage or making much time for self-care\" during the campaign. She warns the reader of the dangers of one's inner circle turning into an echo chamber.\n\nWhat's more striking is that the book fails even to get its own story straight: Which came first, Ivanka's women's-empowerment initiative or her desire to sell more shoes? The initiative evolved \"very organically,\" she writes. And yet throughout the book she reverts to the tone of a pitch deck: \"I designed my company around a larger mission. Whether you're trying on a pair of my heels or perusing my Web site for interviewing tips, my 'why' is to provide you-a woman who works-with solutions and inspiration.\" A few pages later, she describes her entry into the fashion business as a \"market opportunity . . . ready to be seized.\" The book ultimately doesn't try very hard to obscure the fact that the Women Who Work initiative was created, as the Times _ _recently reported , as a way to make Ivanka products more marketable. She seems unwilling to acknowledge-if this is something that she has even grasped in the first place-that there could, hypothetically, be a difference between what's good for women and what's good for her brand.\n\nIn \"The Trump Card,\" which was published in 2009, Ivanka broadcasts her similarity to her father. \"That's what you get from this particular Daddy's girl,\" she writes at one point. In \"Women Who Work,\" she praises Trump but positions herself as separate from him. The section dividers in the book are pale pink and meant to be Instagrammed, with elaborately lettered quotes from other people labelled #ITWiseWords; she recommends graciousness, family time, and the cultivation of \"brain-boosting hobbies\" such as chess and calligraphy. Nonetheless, on occasion, she sounds quite a bit like the President. \"When it comes to business, whatever it is I'm doing, I'm incredibly dedicated to creating solutions for modern women who are living full, multidimensional lives,\" she writes. The book is full of random advertisements for Trump companies, like this one: \"Scion Hotels offer energized social experiences and shared work spaces designed to bring people together to exchange ideas and create.\" Sometimes Ivanka even deploys Trump's comically obtuse diction: \"I personally love the word 'curious.' I identify with it quite a bit because I am deeply curious.\"\n\nAs was true of her previous book, there's very little advice in \"Women Who Work\" that is specific to women. A reading list at the back contains fifty-three books and TED Talk recommendations-thirty-nine of which were authored by men. There's no shortage of woman-targeted branding _ _throughout the book-\"You are a woman who works,\" Ivanka writes, over and over again-but the first actual mention of a gendered situation occurs on page ninety-four, when she notes that women, more than men, can face negative repercussions when they try to negotiate a raise. Her counsel, though, is entirely general: do your research; prove your worth. On page one hundred and four, she finally lays out a woman-specific suggestion: we should be more like men and apply for jobs for which we're not completely qualified. Given the circumstances, it's almost funny. In a later section on work/life balance-a \"myth,\" according to Ivanka, who nonetheless advocates finding a \"work/life rhythm that's optimal for you\"-there's quite a bit of advice about working through and around pregnancy and motherhood, mostly in the form of quotes from Rosie Pope, an entrepreneur who briefly had her own Bravo show called \"Pregnant in Heels.\"\n\nThe other quoted experts-and there are hundreds-are all over the map. There's Stephen Covey, the business consultant and teacher who wrote \"7 Habits of Highly Effective People.\" There's Socrates. There's Toni Morrison, who is quoted as saying, \"Bit by bit, she had claimed herself. Freeing yourself was one thing, claiming ownership of that freed self was another.\" (Ivanka does not note that those lines are from the novel \"Beloved\" and refer to freedom from actual slavery; in this context, they are used as the chapter divider before a section on time management, in which she asks women, \"Are you a slave to your time or the master of it?\") There's Charlotte Perkins Gilman, the feminist author and activist who once wrote, Ivanka has learned, \"Life is a verb, not a noun.\" There's a woman with a food blog \"dedicated to turning veggies and fruit into spiralized noodles\" who appears to offer advice on resilience.\n\nAmid this chorus, Ivanka avoids going into detail about her fashion business, which, as is clear from other reporting, is not the alluring retail juggernaut she sketches here. Sales are uneven: her clothing has been dropped by retailers and relabelled by the factory. Marissa Kraxberger, one of the Ivanka Trump employees who helped create Women Who Work, has said that she \"fought long and hard\" to get Ivanka to agree to give her eight weeks' paid maternity leave ; Kraxberger was part of an initial team of five senior executives, four of whom have since left the brand .\n\nLike \"The Trump Card,\" \"Women Who Work\" is written for an audience whose greatest obstacles are internal, and Ivanka's advice is, once again, Ivanka-specific. Where, as a twentysomething, she advised women to go into the office on Sundays, she now counsels women to ask for flextime and commit to sending e-mails at night. By the end of the book, she's basically speaking to no one. Wealthy upper managers with families don't need to be reminded of the importance of setting goals, and Ivanka's directives are utterly irrelevant to anyone struggling to pay for childcare and housing at the same time. Women outside the corporate world and creative class do not figure into her vision of endless upward mobility at all. In one chapter, she writes, with a sense of courage that is jaw-droppingly misplaced, \"If I can help celebrate the fact that I'm a superengaged mom and unabashedly ambitious entrepreneur, that yes, I'm on a construction site in the morning and at the dinner table with my kids in the evening, I'm going to do that.\" And why wouldn't she? Who wouldn't celebrate that level of ability and accomplishment-except, maybe, the type of man who would say that putting your wife to work is a dangerous thing ? The fundamental dishonesty of Ivanka Trump's book is clearest in the fact that she never acknowledges the difficulty of knowing, or being governed by, anyone like that.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "How Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump, Jr., Avoided a Criminal Indictment\n\nThis article is a collaboration between The New Yorker, ProPublica, and\nWNYC.\n\nIn the spring of 2012, Donald Trump's two eldest children, Ivanka Trump\nand Donald Trump, Jr., found themselves in a precarious legal position.\nFor two years, prosecutors in the Manhattan District Attorney's office\nhad been building a criminal case against them for misleading\nprospective buyers of units in the Trump SoHo, a hotel and condo\ndevelopment that was failing to sell. Despite the best efforts of the\nsiblings' defense team, the case had not gone away. An indictment seemed\nlike a real possibility. The evidence included e-mails from the Trumps\nmaking clear that they were aware they were using inflated figures about\nhow well the condos were selling to lure buyers.\n\nIn one e-mail, according to four people who have seen it, the Trumps\ndiscussed how to coördinate false information they had given to\nprospective buyers. In another, according to a person who read the\ne-mails, they worried that a reporter might be on to them. In yet\nanother, Donald, Jr., spoke reassuringly to a broker who was concerned\nabout the false statements, saying that nobody would ever find out,\nbecause only people on the e-mail chain or in the Trump Organization\nknew about the deception, according to a person who saw the e-mail.\nThere was \"no doubt\" that the Trump children \"approved, knew of, agreed\nto, and intentionally inflated the numbers to make more sales,\" one\nperson who saw the e-mails told us. \"They knew it was wrong.\"\n\nIn 2010, when the Major Economic Crimes Bureau of the D.A.'s office\nopened an investigation of the siblings, the Trump Organization had\nhired several top New York criminal-defense lawyers to represent Donald,\nJr., and Ivanka. These attorneys had met with prosecutors in the bureau\nseveral times. They conceded that their clients had made exaggerated\nclaims, but argued that the overstatements didn't amount to criminal\nmisconduct. Still, the case dragged on. In a meeting with the defense\nteam, Donald Trump, Sr., expressed frustration that the investigation\nhad not been closed. Soon after, his longtime personal lawyer, Marc\nKasowitz, entered the case.\n\nAudio: Listen to WNYC's story about how Ivanka and Donald Trump, Jr., came close to being charged with felony fraud.\n\nKasowitz, who by then had been the elder Donald Trump's attorney for a\ndecade, is primarily a civil litigator, with little experience in\ncriminal matters. But, in 2012, Kasowitz donated twenty-five thousand\ndollars to the reëlection campaign of the Manhattan District Attorney,\nCyrus Vance, Jr., making Kasowitz one of Vance's largest donors.\nKasowitz decided to bypass the lower-level prosecutors and went directly\nto Vance to ask that the investigation be dropped.\n\nOn May 16, 2012, Kasowitz visited Vance's office at One Hogan Place, in\ndowntown Manhattan-a faded edifice made famous by the television show\n\"Law & Order.\" Dan Alonso, the Chief Assistant District Attorney, and\nAdam Kaufmann, the chief of the investigative division, were also at the\nmeeting, but no one from the Major Economic Crimes Bureau attended.\nKasowitz did not introduce any new arguments or facts during his\nsession. He simply repeated the arguments that the other defense lawyers\nhad been making for months.\n\nUltimately, Vance overruled his own prosecutors. Three months after the\nmeeting, he told them to drop the case. Kasowitz subsequently boasted to\ncolleagues about representing the Trump children, according to two\npeople. He said that the case was \"really dangerous,\" one person said,\nand that it was \"amazing I got them off.\" (Kasowitz denied making such a\nstatement.)\n\nVance defended his decision. \"I did not at the time believe beyond a\nreasonable doubt that a crime had been committed,\" he told us. \"I had to\nmake a call and I made the call, and I think I made the right call.\"\n\nJust before the 2012 meeting, Vance's campaign had returned Kasowitz's\ntwenty-five-thousand-dollar contribution, in keeping with what Vance\ndescribes as standard practice when a donor has a case before his\noffice. Kasowitz \"had no influence, and his contributions had no\ninfluence whatsoever on my decision-making in the case,\" Vance said.\n\nBut, less than six months after the D.A.'s office dropped the case,\nKasowitz made an even larger donation to Vance's campaign, and helped\nraise more from others-eventually, a total of more than fifty thousand\ndollars. After being asked about these donations as part of the\nreporting for this article-more than four years after the fact-Vance\nsaid he now plans to give back Kasowitz's second contribution, too. \"I\ndon't want the money to be a millstone around anybody's neck, including\nthe office's,\" he said.\n\nKasowitz told us that his donations to Vance were unrelated to the case. \"I\ndonated to Cy Vance's campaign because I was and remain extremely\nimpressed by him as a person of impeccable integrity, as a brilliant\nlawyer and as a public servant with creative ideas and tremendous\nability,\" Kasowitz wrote in an e-mailed statement. \"I have never made a\ncontribution to anyone's campaign, including Cy Vance's, as a\n'quid-pro-quo' for anything.\"\n\nLast year, the Times reported the existence of the criminal investigation into the Trump SoHo project.\nBut the prosecutor's focus on Ivanka and Donald, Jr., and the e-mail\nevidence against them, as well as Kasowitz's involvement, and Vance's\ndecision to overrule his prosecutors, had not previously been made\npublic. This account is based on interviews with twenty sources familiar\nwith the investigation, court records, and other public documents. We\nwere not able to review copies of the e-mails that were the focal point\nof the inquiry. We are relying on the accounts of multiple individuals\nwho have seen them.\n\nRequests for interviews with Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump, Jr., were\nreferred to Alan Garten, the chief legal officer of the Trump\nOrganization. In an e-mailed response, Garten did not address a list of\nquestions about the criminal case. Instead, he quoted the company's\nfilings in civil litigation relating to the Trump SoHo, which described\ncomplaints as \"a simple case of buyers' remorse.\"\n\nBut even a lawyer in the Trump camp acknowledged that the way the case\nwas resolved was unusual. \"Dropping the case was reasonable,\" Paul\nGrand, a partner at Morvillo Abramowitz who was part of the Trump SoHo\ndefense team, said. \"The manner in which it was accomplished is\ncurious.\"\n\nGrand, who was a partner of Vance's when the District Attorney was in\nprivate practice, said that he did not believe that the D.A.'s office had\nevidence of criminal misconduct by the Trump children. But the meeting\nbetween Vance and Kasowitz \"didn't have an air you'd like,\" he said. \"If\nyou and I were District Attorney and you knew that a subject of an\ninvestigation was represented by two or three well-thought-of lawyers in\ntown, and all of a sudden someone who was a contributor to your campaign\nshowed up on your doorstep, and the regular lawyers are nowhere to be\nseen, you'd think about how you'd want to proceed.\"\n\nIn June, 2006, during the season finale of \"The Apprentice,\" Donald\nTrump, Sr., unveiled the Trump SoHo as a visionary project. The luxury\ndevelopment was intended to mark the ascension of Ivanka and Donald,\nJr.,-then twenty-four and twenty-eight years old, respectively-as full\nplayers in the Trump empire. They signed the licensing deal alongside\ntheir father, and photographs of Ivanka were featured in the Trump\nSoHo's advertising, under the tagline \"Possess your own SoHo.\"\n\nTheir partners on the project included two Soviet-born businessmen,\nFelix Sater and Tevfik Arif, who ran the Bayrock Group, a real-estate-development firm. Sater had a history of running afoul of the law. In\n1993, he was convicted of assault and spent about a year in prison for\nattacking a man with the stem of a margarita glass in a bar fight. In\n1998, he pleaded guilty to one count of racketeering for his role in a\nforty-million-dollar securities-fraud scheme.\n\nThe Trump SoHo was beleaguered from the start: named for one of\nManhattan's trendiest neighborhoods, the development wasn't really in\nSoHo but located just west of it, near the entrance ramp to the Holland\nTunnel. Zoning laws wouldn't allow a residential tower at the location,\nso the Trumps fell back on an alternative: a \"condo-hotel,\" in which\nbuyers got a hotel room rather than an apartment, and were legally\nprohibited from staying there more than a hundred and twenty nights per\nyear. Worse, the high-priced condos hit the market in September, 2007,\njust as the global economy began to crater in what became the largest\nfinancial crisis since the Great Depression.\n\nBusiness was slow, but the Trump family claimed the opposite. In April,\n2008, they said that thirty-one per cent of the condos in the building\nhad been purchased. Donald, Jr., boasted to The Real Deal magazine that fifty-five per cent of the units had been bought. In June, 2008,\nDonald, Jr., and Ivanka, alongside their brother Eric, gathered the\nforeign press at Trump Tower in Manhattan, where Ivanka announced that\nsixty per cent had been snapped up. \"We're in a very fortunate position\nwhere we have enough sales, and now we are strategically targeting\ncertain buyers,\" she said.\n\nNone of that was true. According to a sworn affidavit by a Trump partner\nfiled with the New York Attorney General's office, by March of 2010,\nalmost two years after the press conference, only 15.8 per cent of units\nhad been sold.\n\nThis was more than a marketing problem. The deal hinged on selling at\nleast fifteen per cent of the units. By law, the sales couldn't close\nwith anything less. The Trumps and their partners would have had to\nreturn the buyers' down payments.\n\nSome buyers concluded that they'd been cheated. In August, 2010, some\nsued the Trump Organization and others involved in the project in New\nYork federal court. \"This action seeks to redress the substantial and\nongoing pattern of fraudulent misrepresentations and deceptive sales\npractices\" by the Trumps and the other defendants, the suit charged. The\nplaintiffs argued that there's a vast difference in value between a unit\nin a building that is fifteen-per-cent sold and one that is\nsixty-per-cent sold. Their complaint accused the sellers, including the\nTrumps, of \"a consistent and concerted pattern of outright lies.\"\n\nAfter the civil suit was filed, the Manhattan District Attorney's office\nopened a criminal investigation. Prosecutors are often wary of getting\ninvolved in a dispute between wealthy litigants. But, in this instance,\naccording to a person familiar with their thinking, the lawyers in the\nMajor Economic Crimes Bureau quickly concluded that there was enough to\nwarrant an investigation. They believed that Ivanka and Donald, Jr.,\nmight have violated the Martin Act, a New York statute that bans any\nfalse statement in conjunction with the sale of a security or real\nestate. Prosecutors also saw potential fraud and larceny charges,\napplying a legal theory that, by overstating the number of units sold,\nthe Trumps were falsely inflating their value and, in effect, cheating\nunsuspecting condo buyers.\n\nPeirce Moser, an Assistant District Attorney known for his methodical,\ncomprehensive investigations, soon took over the case. \"He is not a\ncowboy,\" Marc Scholl, who spent almost forty years as a prosecutor in\nthe District Attorney's office, said. \"He is certainly not out to make\nheadlines for himself or to advance himself.\"\n\nOn the other side, the Trumps' defense team included Gary Naftalis and\nDavid Frankel, of the law firm Kramer Levin; Paul Grand represented one\nof the real-estate brokers who had worked with the Trumps.\n\nAs the investigation progressed, Vance suffered an embarrassing setback\nin one of his highest-profile cases. In the summer of 2011, his office\nhad abandoned a sexual-assault case against the former managing director\nof the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Vance, who\nwas pummelled in the press afterward, denied in his interview with us\nthat the case made him reluctant to take on another prominent defendant.\n\nA few months later, on January 11, 2012, Marc Kasowitz contributed\ntwenty-five thousand dollars to Vance's campaign, unbeknownst to\nprosecutors in the Major Economic Crimes Bureau, who continued their\nwork. Moser was particularly focussed on e-mail correspondence, according\nto seven people familiar with the case.\n\nMoser began considering impanelling a special grand jury, according to a\nperson familiar with the investigation. That would have represented a\nsignificant escalation in the case, because it is often a prelude to\nindictments. With a grand jury in place, defense lawyers knew the risk\nof indictment was high.\n\nThe defense team offered a deal to stave off this possibility, floating\nthe possibility of a settlement of some kind, including a deferred\nprosecution agreement, which would have meant the corporate equivalent\nof probation for the Trump Organization. With the investigation\nappearing to gather momentum, Naftalis and Grand, who had already met\nwith the prosecutors twice, began to step up their campaign against the\ncase. Grand calls this the \"internal appellate process.\" Particularly\nwhen well-heeled or high-profile defendants are involved, there can be a\nmulti-month advocacy process that slowly makes its way up the hierarchy\ninside the Manhattan D.A.'s office.\n\nGrand and Naftalis decided that it would be unwise to go over the heads\nof the staff prosecutors. Instead, on April 18, 2012, they sent a letter\nto Adam Kaufmann, then the chief of the investigative division (he's now\nin private practice), outlining their arguments. The next day, the\ndefense lawyers met with Moser, Kaufmann, and others from the\nprosecution team. The defense team acknowledged that the Trumps made\nsome exaggerated statements in order to sell the units. But this was\nmere \"puffery\"-harmless exaggeration. Such language, they contended,\ndidn't amount to criminal conduct. The Trumps weren't selling useless\nswampland in Florida. The condos existed. And the buyers' money was in\nescrow the entire time.\n\nThe defense lawyers argued that bringing such a case to trial would be\nwasteful and that resources would be better spent on more serious\noffenses. As Grand put it to us during our recent interview, \"I guess in\na world that is completely pure and where there is no deviation between\npropriety and the law, that kind of exaggeration and deliberately\nconcentrated exaggeration can be pursued. But is that the kind of\ncriminal-law enforcement the D.A. should be doing?\"\n\nMoser's answer seemed to be yes, and he found support among his\nsupervisors. Moser had prepared an elaborate PowerPoint presentation,\nfeaturing dozens of e-mails that prosecutors believed showed that Ivanka\nand Donald, Jr., had repeatedly lied to buyers. \"You couldn't have had a\nbetter e-mail trail,\" a person familiar with the investigation told us.\n\nAt the meeting, Kaufmann peppered the defense team with questions, at\none point raising his voice, according to a person who was there. \"I\nbelieved in the case,\" Kaufmann told us, though he declined to discuss\nthe evidence. \"But believing in the case doesn't mean we had reached the\npoint when [I had] settled on what should happen with the case.\"\n\nWhite-collar criminal cases are often challenging to bring because of\ntheir complexity. And, by the time of the April meeting, prosecutors\nknew that they faced another impediment, this one created by legal\nmaneuvers in the Trumps' civil case. Five months earlier, the Trumps and\ntheir partners had reached a settlement with the disgruntled buyers. The\ndefendants agreed to return ninety per cent of the buyers' deposits, plus\ntheir attorneys' fees. But they extracted a rare concession in return:\nthe plaintiffs agreed not to coöperate with prosecutors unless they were\nsubpoenaed. (Garten, the Trump Organization's chief legal officer, noted\nthat the settlement terms were confidential and declined to comment on\nthem.)\n\nAdam Leitman Bailey, the attorney for the buyers, had been helping\nprosecutors. Now he provided aid to the Trumps, writing a letter to the\nDistrict Attorney that stated, \"We acknowledge that the Defendants have\nnot violated the criminal laws of the State of New York or the United\nStates.\" In our interview with Vance, he said that he had never before seen a\nletter where plaintiffs in a civil case asserted that no crime had been\ncommitted. \"I don't think I'd ever received a letter like it,\" Vance\nsaid. He calls it a \"significant and important\" communication.\n\nCertainly, prosecutors could subpoena the buyers of Trump condos. But\nthey feared the witnesses would undercut the criminal case by claiming\nthey weren't victims of a fraud.\n\nStill, Moser, backed by his supervisors, persisted. \"Peirce believed in\nhis case,\" Grand said. \"We did not succeed in talking him out of it and\ndidn't succeed in talking one or two levels above him into dropping the\ncase.\"\n\nFinally, in the spring of 2012, Kasowitz joined the case. His\ninvolvement \"came from out of the blue,\" Grand told us. He and the other\nlawyers assumed Kasowitz intervened at the request of Donald Trump, Sr.\n\nIn early May, 2012, Kasowitz asked to see the District Attorney. Vance\ntold us that such meetings aren't unusual-but his investigations chief at the\ntime, Kaufmann, characterized Kasowitz's request as \"a little\npremature.\" The Trump lawyer was going over the heads of everyone who\nhad been working on the case. The gathering, on May 16th, lasted twenty to\nthirty minutes, according to Vance. Kasowitz repeated the arguments the\ndefense team had made before.\n\nAfterward, Kasowitz didn't seem to think his clients were in the clear.\nOn August 1st, he suggested a settlement, proposing that the Trump\nOrganization would not admit to wrongdoing but would agree not to\nmislead people in the future and would submit to outside monitoring. The\noffer proved unnecessary. Two days later, on August 3, 2012, Moser\ncalled the Trumps' defense attorneys and told them that prosecutors were\ndropping the investigation. (Moser, who still works for Vance, now as\nsenior investigative counsel, did not respond to requests for an\ninterview made over multiple months. Shortly before this article was\npublished, he sent an e-mail stating that Vance's ultimate decision in\nthe case \"was not unreasonable\" and that, throughout the process, the\nD.A. asked \"smart questions\" and expressed \"reasonable skepticism.\")\n\nIn his interview, Vance defended his decision to drop the case with no\nconditions, even after Kasowitz offered a deal. \"This started as a civil\ncase,\" Vance said. \"It was settled as a civil case with a statement by\nthe purchasers of luxury properties that they weren't victims. And, at\nthe end of the day, I felt if we were not going to charge criminally, we\nshould leave it as a civil case in the posture in which it came to us.\"\n\nIn September, 2012, within weeks of the case being resolved, Kasowitz\ncontacted Vance's campaign about hosting a fund-raiser, according to a\nspokesperson for the campaign. Kasowitz held the event that January. He\npersonally donated almost thirty-two thousand dollars to Vance's\ncampaign, and twenty of his law firm's partners and employees kicked in\nat least another nine thousand dollars. Then, in October, 2013, as\nElection Day approached, he hosted a breakfast for Republicans for Cy\nVance, which raised an additional nine thousand dollars.\n\nVance defended his decision to accept the money Kasowitz sent his way.\n\"We did the right thing,\" he said, referring to the decision to drop the\ncase. \"Another five and a half months go by. Marc Kasowitz has no matter\npending before the office for the Trumps or anybody else.

      "text": "How Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump, Jr., Avoided a Criminal Indictment\n\nThis article is a collaboration between The New Yorker, ProPublica, and\nWNYC.\n\nIn the spring of 2012, Donald Trump's two eldest children, Ivanka Trump\nand Donald Trump, Jr., found themselves in a precarious legal position.\nFor two years, prosecutors in the Manhattan District Attorney's office\nhad been building a criminal case against them for misleading\nprospective buyers of units in the Trump SoHo, a hotel and condo\ndevelopment that was failing to sell. Despite the best efforts of the\nsiblings' defense team, the case had not gone away. An indictment seemed\nlike a real possibility. The evidence included e-mails from the Trumps\nmaking clear that they were aware they were using inflated figures about\nhow well the condos were selling to lure buyers.\n\nIn one e-mail, according to four people who have seen it, the Trumps\ndiscussed how to coördinate false information they had given to\nprospective buyers. In another, according to a person who read the\ne-mails, they worried that a reporter might be on to them. In yet\nanother, Donald, Jr., spoke reassuringly to a broker who was concerned\nabout the false statements, saying that nobody would ever find out,\nbecause only people on the e-mail chain or in the Trump Organization\nknew about the deception, according to a person who saw the e-mail.\nThere was \"no doubt\" that the Trump children \"approved, knew of, agreed\nto, and intentionally inflated the numbers to make more sales,\" one\nperson who saw the e-mails told us. \"They knew it was wrong.\"\n\nIn 2010, when the Major Economic Crimes Bureau of the D.A.'s office\nopened an investigation of the siblings, the Trump Organization had\nhired several top New York criminal-defense lawyers to represent Donald,\nJr., and Ivanka. These attorneys had met with prosecutors in the bureau\nseveral times. They conceded that their clients had made exaggerated\nclaims, but argued that the overstatements didn't amount to criminal\nmisconduct. Still, the case dragged on. In a meeting with the defense\nteam, Donald Trump, Sr., expressed frustration that the investigation\nhad not been closed. Soon after, his longtime personal lawyer, Marc\nKasowitz, entered the case.\n\nAudio: Listen to WNYC's story about how Ivanka and Donald Trump, Jr., came close to being charged with felony fraud.\n\nKasowitz, who by then had been the elder Donald Trump's attorney for a\ndecade, is primarily a civil litigator, with little experience in\ncriminal matters. But, in 2012, Kasowitz donated twenty-five thousand\ndollars to the reëlection campaign of the Manhattan District Attorney,\nCyrus Vance, Jr., making Kasowitz one of Vance's largest donors.\nKasowitz decided to bypass the lower-level prosecutors and went directly\nto Vance to ask that the investigation be dropped.\n\nOn May 16, 2012, Kasowitz visited Vance's office at One Hogan Place, in\ndowntown Manhattan-a faded edifice made famous by the television show\n\"Law & Order.\" Dan Alonso, the Chief Assistant District Attorney, and\nAdam Kaufmann, the chief of the investigative division, were also at the\nmeeting, but no one from the Major Economic Crimes Bureau attended.\nKasowitz did not introduce any new arguments or facts during his\nsession. He simply repeated the arguments that the other defense lawyers\nhad been making for months.\n\nUltimately, Vance overruled his own prosecutors. Three months after the\nmeeting, he told them to drop the case. Kasowitz subsequently boasted to\ncolleagues about representing the Trump children, according to two\npeople. He said that the case was \"really dangerous,\" one person said,\nand that it was \"amazing I got them off.\" (Kasowitz denied making such a\nstatement.)\n\nVance defended his decision. \"I did not at the time believe beyond a\nreasonable doubt that a crime had been committed,\" he told us. \"I had to\nmake a call and I made the call, and I think I made the right call.\"\n\nJust before the 2012 meeting, Vance's campaign had returned Kasowitz's\ntwenty-five-thousand-dollar contribution, in keeping with what Vance\ndescribes as standard practice when a donor has a case before his\noffice. Kasowitz \"had no influence, and his contributions had no\ninfluence whatsoever on my decision-making in the case,\" Vance said.\n\nBut, less than six months after the D.A.'s office dropped the case,\nKasowitz made an even larger donation to Vance's campaign, and helped\nraise more from others-eventually, a total of more than fifty thousand\ndollars. After being asked about these donations as part of the\nreporting for this article-more than four years after the fact-Vance\nsaid he now plans to give back Kasowitz's second contribution, too. \"I\ndon't want the money to be a millstone around anybody's neck, including\nthe office's,\" he said.\n\nKasowitz told us that his donations to Vance were unrelated to the case. \"I\ndonated to Cy Vance's campaign because I was and remain extremely\nimpressed by him as a person of impeccable integrity, as a brilliant\nlawyer and as a public servant with creative ideas and tremendous\nability,\" Kasowitz wrote in an e-mailed statement. \"I have never made a\ncontribution to anyone's campaign, including Cy Vance's, as a\n'quid-pro-quo' for anything.\"\n\nLast year, the Times reported the existence of the criminal investigation into the Trump SoHo project.\nBut the prosecutor's focus on Ivanka and Donald, Jr., and the e-mail\nevidence against them, as well as Kasowitz's involvement, and Vance's\ndecision to overrule his prosecutors, had not previously been made\npublic. This account is based on interviews with twenty sources familiar\nwith the investigation, court records, and other public documents. We\nwere not able to review copies of the e-mails that were the focal point\nof the inquiry. We are relying on the accounts of multiple individuals\nwho have seen them.\n\nRequests for interviews with Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump, Jr., were\nreferred to Alan Garten, the chief legal officer of the Trump\nOrganization. In an e-mailed response, Garten did not address a list of\nquestions about the criminal case. Instead, he quoted the company's\nfilings in civil litigation relating to the Trump SoHo, which described\ncomplaints as \"a simple case of buyers' remorse.\"\n\nBut even a lawyer in the Trump camp acknowledged that the way the case\nwas resolved was unusual. \"Dropping the case was reasonable,\" Paul\nGrand, a partner at Morvillo Abramowitz who was part of the Trump SoHo\ndefense team, said. \"The manner in which it was accomplished is\ncurious.\"\n\nGrand, who was a partner of Vance's when the District Attorney was in\nprivate practice, said that he did not believe that the D.A.'s office had\nevidence of criminal misconduct by the Trump children. But the meeting\nbetween Vance and Kasowitz \"didn't have an air you'd like,\" he said. \"If\nyou and I were District Attorney and you knew that a subject of an\ninvestigation was represented by two or three well-thought-of lawyers in\ntown, and all of a sudden someone who was a contributor to your campaign\nshowed up on your doorstep, and the regular lawyers are nowhere to be\nseen, you'd think about how you'd want to proceed.\"\n\nIn June, 2006, during the season finale of \"The Apprentice,\" Donald\nTrump, Sr., unveiled the Trump SoHo as a visionary project. The luxury\ndevelopment was intended to mark the ascension of Ivanka and Donald,\nJr.,-then twenty-four and twenty-eight years old, respectively-as full\nplayers in the Trump empire. They signed the licensing deal alongside\ntheir father, and photographs of Ivanka were featured in the Trump\nSoHo's advertising, under the tagline \"Possess your own SoHo.\"\n\nTheir partners on the project included two Soviet-born businessmen,\nFelix Sater and Tevfik Arif, who ran the Bayrock Group, a real-estate-development firm. Sater had a history of running afoul of the law. In\n1993, he was convicted of assault and spent about a year in prison for\nattacking a man with the stem of a margarita glass in a bar fight. In\n1998, he pleaded guilty to one count of racketeering for his role in a\nforty-million-dollar securities-fraud scheme.\n\nThe Trump SoHo was beleaguered from the start: named for one of\nManhattan's trendiest neighborhoods, the development wasn't really in\nSoHo but located just west of it, near the entrance ramp to the Holland\nTunnel. Zoning laws wouldn't allow a residential tower at the location,\nso the Trumps fell back on an alternative: a \"condo-hotel,\" in which\nbuyers got a hotel room rather than an apartment, and were legally\nprohibited from staying there more than a hundred and twenty nights per\nyear. Worse, the high-priced condos hit the market in September, 2007,\njust as the global economy began to crater in what became the largest\nfinancial crisis since the Great Depression.\n\nBusiness was slow, but the Trump family claimed the opposite. In April,\n2008, they said that thirty-one per cent of the condos in the building\nhad been purchased. Donald, Jr., boasted to The Real Deal magazine that fifty-five per cent of the units had been bought. In June, 2008,\nDonald, Jr., and Ivanka, alongside their brother Eric, gathered the\nforeign press at Trump Tower in Manhattan, where Ivanka announced that\nsixty per cent had been snapped up. \"We're in a very fortunate position\nwhere we have enough sales, and now we are strategically targeting\ncertain buyers,\" she said.\n\nNone of that was true. According to a sworn affidavit by a Trump partner\nfiled with the New York Attorney General's office, by March of 2010,\nalmost two years after the press conference, only 15.8 per cent of units\nhad been sold.\n\nThis was more than a marketing problem. The deal hinged on selling at\nleast fifteen per cent of the units. By law, the sales couldn't close\nwith anything less. The Trumps and their partners would have had to\nreturn the buyers' down payments.\n\nSome buyers concluded that they'd been cheated. In August, 2010, some\nsued the Trump Organization and others involved in the project in New\nYork federal court. \"This action seeks to redress the substantial and\nongoing pattern of fraudulent misrepresentations and deceptive sales\npractices\" by the Trumps and the other defendants, the suit charged. The\nplaintiffs argued that there's a vast difference in value between a unit\nin a building that is fifteen-per-cent sold and one that is\nsixty-per-cent sold. Their complaint accused the sellers, including the\nTrumps, of \"a consistent and concerted pattern of outright lies.\"\n\nAfter the civil suit was filed, the Manhattan District Attorney's office\nopened a criminal investigation. Prosecutors are often wary of getting\ninvolved in a dispute between wealthy litigants. But, in this instance,\naccording to a person familiar with their thinking, the lawyers in the\nMajor Economic Crimes Bureau quickly concluded that there was enough to\nwarrant an investigation. They believed that Ivanka and Donald, Jr.,\nmight have violated the Martin Act, a New York statute that bans any\nfalse statement in conjunction with the sale of a security or real\nestate. Prosecutors also saw potential fraud and larceny charges,\napplying a legal theory that, by overstating the number of units sold,\nthe Trumps were falsely inflating their value and, in effect, cheating\nunsuspecting condo buyers.\n\nPeirce Moser, an Assistant District Attorney known for his methodical,\ncomprehensive investigations, soon took over the case. \"He is not a\ncowboy,\" Marc Scholl, who spent almost forty years as a prosecutor in\nthe District Attorney's office, said. \"He is certainly not out to make\nheadlines for himself or to advance himself.\"\n\nOn the other side, the Trumps' defense team included Gary Naftalis and\nDavid Frankel, of the law firm Kramer Levin; Paul Grand represented one\nof the real-estate brokers who had worked with the Trumps.\n\nAs the investigation progressed, Vance suffered an embarrassing setback\nin one of his highest-profile cases. In the summer of 2011, his office\nhad abandoned a sexual-assault case against the former managing director\nof the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Vance, who\nwas pummelled in the press afterward, denied in his interview with us\nthat the case made him reluctant to take on another prominent defendant.\n\nA few months later, on January 11, 2012, Marc Kasowitz contributed\ntwenty-five thousand dollars to Vance's campaign, unbeknownst to\nprosecutors in the Major Economic Crimes Bureau, who continued their\nwork. Moser was particularly focussed on e-mail correspondence, according\nto seven people familiar with the case.\n\nMoser began considering impanelling a special grand jury, according to a\nperson familiar with the investigation. That would have represented a\nsignificant escalation in the case, because it is often a prelude to\nindictments. With a grand jury in place, defense lawyers knew the risk\nof indictment was high.\n\nThe defense team offered a deal to stave off this possibility, floating\nthe possibility of a settlement of some kind, including a deferred\nprosecution agreement, which would have meant the corporate equivalent\nof probation for the Trump Organization. With the investigation\nappearing to gather momentum, Naftalis and Grand, who had already met\nwith the prosecutors twice, began to step up their campaign against the\ncase. Grand calls this the \"internal appellate process.\" Particularly\nwhen well-heeled or high-profile defendants are involved, there can be a\nmulti-month advocacy process that slowly makes its way up the hierarchy\ninside the Manhattan D.A.'s office.\n\nGrand and Naftalis decided that it would be unwise to go over the heads\nof the staff prosecutors. Instead, on April 18, 2012, they sent a letter\nto Adam Kaufmann, then the chief of the investigative division (he's now\nin private practice), outlining their arguments. The next day, the\ndefense lawyers met with Moser, Kaufmann, and others from the\nprosecution team. The defense team acknowledged that the Trumps made\nsome exaggerated statements in order to sell the units. But this was\nmere \"puffery\"-harmless exaggeration. Such language, they contended,\ndidn't amount to criminal conduct. The Trumps weren't selling useless\nswampland in Florida. The condos existed. And the buyers' money was in\nescrow the entire time.\n\nThe defense lawyers argued that bringing such a case to trial would be\nwasteful and that resources would be better spent on more serious\noffenses. As Grand put it to us during our recent interview, \"I guess in\na world that is completely pure and where there is no deviation between\npropriety and the law, that kind of exaggeration and deliberately\nconcentrated exaggeration can be pursued. But is that the kind of\ncriminal-law enforcement the D.A. should be doing?\"\n\nMoser's answer seemed to be yes, and he found support among his\nsupervisors. Moser had prepared an elaborate PowerPoint presentation,\nfeaturing dozens of e-mails that prosecutors believed showed that Ivanka\nand Donald, Jr., had repeatedly lied to buyers. \"You couldn't have had a\nbetter e-mail trail,\" a person familiar with the investigation told us.\n\nAt the meeting, Kaufmann peppered the defense team with questions, at\none point raising his voice, according to a person who was there. \"I\nbelieved in the case,\" Kaufmann told us, though he declined to discuss\nthe evidence. \"But believing in the case doesn't mean we had reached the\npoint when [I had] settled on what should happen with the case.\"\n\nWhite-collar criminal cases are often challenging to bring because of\ntheir complexity.

      "text": "Ivanka Trump and Charles Koch Fuel a Cancel-Culture Clash at Wichita State\n\nA showdown over who rules America's college campuses came to a head in Kansas on Wednesday, in a clash that might be called Cancel Culture vs. the Big Donors. It began last week, when a technical college affiliated with Wichita State University scrapped plans for a virtual commencement address by Donald Trump 's daughter Ivanka, in a bow to student and faculty criticism of the President's response to the nationwide protests over George Floyd 's killing. On Twitter, Ivanka blamed \"cancel culture,\" calling it \"antithetical to academia.\" In a compromise brokered by the university, Ivanka's remarks, instead of headlining the event, were demoted to being one in a menu of choices during the ceremony, on June 6th. If they wished, students could click on a link and see her dressed for the occasion, in a regal white sheath and turquoise earrings and brooch, as she addressed them as \"wartime\" graduates.\n\nThe approach of Wichita State University's president, Jay Golden, won praise from students and faculty members who had circulated petitions opposing the address. But the decision roiled the school's conservative corporate donors, including, reportedly, the billionaire libertarian oil magnate Charles Koch, the owner of Koch Industries, the largest company in Wichita and one of the two largest private companies in the country. According to the Wichita Eagle , Koch Industries threatened to withdraw its financial support for the university; its basketball arena bears Koch's name. The newspaper's story cited a letter, sent to the Kansas Board of Regents, by another corporate booster of the school, Steve Clark, which called for Golden to be fired and warned that Koch Industries and other major corporate donors-including Dan Carney, the founder of Pizza Hut-were \"very upset and quite vocal in their decisions to disavow any further support.\"\n\nIn his letter, according to the Eagle , Clark described a conversation that he'd had with Koch Industries' chief financial officer, Steve Feilmeier, the chair of a fund-raising campaign for a new business building on campus. \"He advised me he's resigning . . . from any further association with the University,\" Clark reportedly wrote. \"He is also advising that Koch Industries rescind all their financial support for programs at the University they've previously funded.\" In an interview, Clark told the Eagle , \"We had Koch in the fold. Now we're going to lose them, and they'll never be back.\" To avoid risking the loss of millions of dollars in financial support for the university, Clark called on the Board of Regents to fire Golden.\n\nInstead, the board held a closed-door session on the matter on Wednesday, while students held a rally and circulated a campus petition in support of Golden, which has now garnered eighty-seven hundred signatures. After meeting for four hours, the board issued an equivocal statement supporting \"freedom of speech and diversity and inclusion.\" Tajahnae Stocker, one of the W.S.U. students who helped organize the rally, told the Eagle , \"The Koch brothers have had a huge influence for way too long, and now is about time to start supporting us instead of supporting a check to the university.\"\n\nClark, who had called for Golden's dismissal, declined to comment.\n\nThe political pressure that wealthy donors exert on universities rarely gets aired so publicly. But there's no mystery in why W.S.U. might quake at the prospect of alienating the Kochs. Charles Koch, whose fortune is estimated to be slightly more than fifty billion dollars, has reportedly given or pledged some fifteen million to W.S.U. in the past seven years. In addition, Koch has committed $3.6 million to fund the university's Institute for the Study of Economic Growth. Although W.S.U. is a public university, the Koch-funded center is a think tank devoted to promoting the billionaire's personal political philosophy, which promotes private enterprise, and not government, as the panacea to virtually all societal problems. In recent years, exposing college students to his libertarian ideology has been a major focus of Koch's philanthropy, and there are now similar Koch-funded programs at some three hundred American colleges and universities. Despite reportedly bridling at the disinvitation of Ivanka Trump, Koch has not been a full-throated supporter of her father, nor a donor to his campaigns. However, Koch and his private political operation have enthusiastically backed a number of Trump Administration policies, including the 2018 corporate tax cuts and the Administration's rollbacks of environmental regulations.\n\nIn a statement sent to me on Wednesday, a spokesman for Koch Industries tried to distance the company from the controversy. \"Steve Clark is a private citizen who is not affiliated with Koch Industries,\" the statement read. \"His views were inaccurate and do not represent Koch Industries.\" The statement went on to say that the company \"is continuing its commitments to WSU\" and believes in \"academic freedom.\" Yet it also said, \"We object to speaker disinvitations,\" adding that \"universities offer students opportunities to encounter new ideas and think for themselves. Limiting access to unpopular speakers, viewpoints, and scholarship doesn't protect students, it cuts off the chance to engage, debate, and criticize.\"\n\nA wealthy donor casting the controversy as a matter of free speech sounds noble. But some of the professors and students who led the protests against Ivanka Trump's commencement address dismissed that argument as specious. Jennifer Ray, an associate professor of photo media at Wichita State, who wrote an open letter to the administration opposing the address that gathered nearly five hundred signatures, pointed out that \"any student who wants to opt-in and hear Ivanka Trump's speech can. It wasn't cancelled, or censored. It's on a menu of speakers they can listen to. So, this First Amendment talk doesn't really apply. The people who are complaining know full well that the speech is available. They just don't like the politics. It was all about the symbolism.\"\n\nRay acknowledged that her reason for opposing the speech was symbolic as well. \"It would have sent a message that the university was against the protesters,\" she said. \"Instead, the university tried to neutralize the situation. They did the right thing. It was quite brave.\"\n\nAmira Coleman, an aspiring opera singer who is a senior at W.S.U. and an African-American supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement, noted that \"Ivanka's speech is still available for anyone who wants to watch it. They just didn't want it to be the headliner. It was a compromise, yet the donors said they wanted to pull their donations. It was not an act of censorship. It was a shift of focus from Ivanka to the needs of the black community here. And now the president is getting punished for listening to the students here. That's sad.\"\n\nIf, in fact, there is any threat to free speech on campus, Ray suggested, the episode showed that it is posed by the school's big donors. \"The real peril is these business partnerships,\" she told me. \"They think they own the school. That's the First Amendment issue.\"\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

But it's par for the course for the people, and in particular the women, in Donald Trump's universe, who have embraced '80s fashion for Trump's entire political career.\n\nOn Monday, June 3, President Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrived in London for his three-day official state visit , during which he will attend a formal state dinner at Buckingham Palace hosted by Queen Elizabeth, meet with Prime Minister Theresa May and business leaders, and then attend a commemoration of D-Day on June 6.\n\nWhen the Trumps arrived at Buckingham Palace for their official greeting and subsequent tour of Westminster Abbey, Melania wore a custom design from Dolce & Gabbana: a white long-sleeved dress, a crisp black belt and collar, and matching wide-brimmed hat designed by her stylist Hervé Pierre, drawing comparisons to both Audrey Hepburn's racetrack ensemble in My Fair Lady and Joan Collins in Dynasty . Ivanka, meanwhile, chose a white puff-sleeve blazer with a peplum and a sparkling belt. She also wore a matching pleated skirt and a white fascinator, which is common for women during daytime events in British high society .\n\nBoth of them were on-the-nose '80s-inspired looks, and like everything these women wear, it was intentional. Melania and Ivanka Trump, and to a larger extent many of the people in Trump's world, have embraced the over-the-top, excessively feminine (or, in the president's case, masculine) fashions of the decade. And in a way, it makes sense: '80s excess and the aesthetics of Trumpism have plenty in common.\n\nMelania Trump doesn't say much, but she often communicates through her clothes. She is the type of first lady to survey hurricane damage while wearing stilettos and visit migrant children at the US-Mexico border in a jacket with the phrase \"I really don't care, do u?\" scrawled on the back. She has worn symbols of European colonialism while on a visit to Africa and then reportedly expressed frustration that the press was focusing on her outfits.\n\nMelania's clothing is often the only place we see her express thoughts and opinions at all, and fashion diplomacy - the idea that one can transmit important messages via the things they wear - matters. Yet as Eliza Brooke notes for Vox , it's extremely difficult to determine what, exactly, the first lady means when she wears anything, because she's provided little context to work with. The day she wore the controversial Zara jacket, for instance, her publicist said that it had \"no hidden message,\" but after the president asserted on Twitter that it was a message to the media, Melania changed her tune, saying in an ABC interview that it was targeting her critics and the media.\n\nMelania may not like it when the world questions the things she wears, but as the first lady, all her outfit choices are inherently political. Whereas first lady Michelle Obama tended to opt for up-and-coming designers with a mix of affordable pieces in fun colors as a way to message her approachable, down-to-earth personality, Melania sticks with couture European designers in silhouettes that accentuate her former-model figure. It's garnered her many fans among people who prefer women to \"dress like women,\" as Trump requires his female staff to do . It's clear that intense energy is spent on making Melania look fabulous - it's the opposite of the \"effortless\" aesthetic that many women in 2019 strive for, which is part of what makes it so striking.\n\nIt's not surprising, then, that much of Melania's style is deeply rooted in the '80s. It was an era of maximalism, where every fashion trend seemed to be big: teased hair, loud makeup, and giant shoulder pads that triangulated into super-cinched waists - which, removed from the context of the period, now look like costumes. Mainstream fashion in the '80s was not about subtlety.\n\nNeither are the Trumps. The president was famously described by the author Fran Lebowitz as \"a poor person's idea of a rich person,\" which is to say that Trump's idea of taste and status has little of the subtlety we expect of truly wealthy people. He is flashy, he is gauche, he plasters his living spaces with shiny gold and lavish marble in a style the author Peter York called \"dictator chic,\" the design style that borrows from 18th-century French monarchs and covers it with macho decor and high-end brand names.\n\nIt's an aesthetic closely associated with the 1980s writ large, wherein Reaganism and neoliberal economic policies allowed companies to get bigger and individuals to get richer regardless of the cost. In pop culture, wealthy people were revered as glamorous and aspirational, but also - in shows like Dynasty, Dallas, and the early reality show Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous - cartoonishly drenched in signifiers of their wealth. Watch a TV show or film from the '80s and it's hilariously clear who has money and who doesn't (see: Pretty in Pink ).\n\nTrump was also impossible to avoid in the '80s. It was the decade when the then-30-something Donald built his name as a real estate developer, tabloid staple, and co-author of The Art of the Deal .

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nA new White House initiative aims to economically uplift women in developing countries - but gender equality advocates see a big flaw.\n\nby Nicole Fallert\n\nIvanka Trump has her next project.\n\nThe president's daughter and senior adviser is heading the Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative , which seeks to economically empower women in foreign countries. The project is launching with funding from the US Agency for International Development and will eventually give up to $300 million to 10 US government agencies to help a projected 50 million women around the world become economically independent by 2025.\n\n\"American women demonstrate every day that when women are free to thrive and prosper, they create jobs, strengthen our communities, and bring greater peace and prosperity to our nation and all over the world,\" President Donald Trump said in the Oval Office two weeks ago when he signed a memorandum establishing the project and dedicating an initial $50 million.\n\nBut the biggest barrier to the initiative's success might be another Trump administration policy: the global gag rule , a federal directive that prevents organizations abroad from receiving money from the US government if they discuss, let alone perform, abortions. Trump, as has every other Republican president since Reagan, reimposed the gag rule when he took office. He also broadened it to cover nearly all health care funding, rather than just family planning funding.\n\nGender equality advocates are skeptical Trump's initiative can be as effective as the White House says it will be if health is left out of the conversation, according to an analysis of the initiative by the Coalition for Women's Economic Empowerment and Equality .\n\n\"We noticed immediately and it's stayed consistent, that piece of the conversation is absent and glaringly so,\" said Teresa Casale, a policy advocate at the International Center for Research on Women, a member of the coalition.\n\nA recent report from Casale's organization found that, across 97 countries, each additional child reduces a woman's labor force participation by 5 to 10 percentage points. Unmet needs for contraception increase the rate of informal work, which actually endangers women's working rights and makes them more vulnerable to unemployment if they become pregnant.\n\nTrump's initiative consists of three pillars, according to an op-ed Ivanka Trump wrote for the Wall Street Journal . The first pillar focuses on workforce development and the second on promoting female entrepreneurs. The third pillar is dedicated to \"eliminating the legal, regulatory and cultural barriers that prevent women from participating in their local economies.\"\n\nTen US government agencies, including the State Department and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, will receive money to develop programs meant to accomplish these goals.\n\nIvanka Trump claims the initiative will increase global economic output by $12 trillion by 2025.\n\nThe Coalition for Women's Empowerment and Equality, founded after Ivanka Trump said at the beginning of her father's term that she wanted to support women globally, analyzed the plan and praised the idea of the third pillar. It is meant to address environmental factors that often limit women's economic decision-making, such as obtaining credit, property ownership, inheritance law, and unpaid care work.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nA new White House initiative aims to economically uplift women in developing countries - but gender equality advocates see a big flaw.\n\nby Nicole Fallert\n\nIvanka Trump has her next project.\n\nThe president's daughter and senior adviser is heading the Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative , which seeks to economically empower women in foreign countries. The project is launching with funding from the US Agency for International Development and will eventually give up to $300 million to 10 US government agencies to help a projected 50 million women around the world become economically independent by 2025.\n\n\"American women demonstrate every day that when women are free to thrive and prosper, they create jobs, strengthen our communities, and bring greater peace and prosperity to our nation and all over the world,\" President Donald Trump said in the Oval Office two weeks ago when he signed a memorandum establishing the project and dedicating an initial $50 million.\n\nBut the biggest barrier to the initiative's success might be another Trump administration policy: the global gag rule , a federal directive that prevents organizations abroad from receiving money from the US government if they discuss, let alone perform, abortions. Trump, as has every other Republican president since Reagan, reimposed the gag rule when he took office. He also broadened it to cover nearly all health care funding, rather than just family planning funding.\n\nGender equality advocates are skeptical Trump's initiative can be as effective as the White House says it will be if health is left out of the conversation, according to an analysis of the initiative by the Coalition for Women's Economic Empowerment and Equality .\n\n\"We noticed immediately and it's stayed consistent, that piece of the conversation is absent and glaringly so,\" said Teresa Casale, a policy advocate at the International Center for Research on Women, a member of the coalition.\n\nA recent report from Casale's organization found that, across 97 countries, each additional child reduces a woman's labor force participation by 5 to 10 percentage points. Unmet needs for contraception increase the rate of informal work, which actually endangers women's working rights and makes them more vulnerable to unemployment if they become pregnant.\n\nTrump's initiative consists of three pillars, according to an op-ed Ivanka Trump wrote for the Wall Street Journal . The first pillar focuses on workforce development and the second on promoting female entrepreneurs. The third pillar is dedicated to \"eliminating the legal, regulatory and cultural barriers that prevent women from participating in their local economies.\"\n\nTen US government agencies, including the State Department and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, will receive money to develop programs meant to accomplish these goals.\n\nIvanka Trump claims the initiative will increase global economic output by $12 trillion by 2025.\n\nThe Coalition for Women's Empowerment and Equality, founded after Ivanka Trump said at the beginning of her father's term that she wanted to support women globally, analyzed the plan and praised the idea of the third pillar. It is meant to address environmental factors that often limit women's economic decision-making, such as obtaining credit, property ownership, inheritance law, and unpaid care work. On the plan's website , the analysis also praised the inclusion of gender-based violence as a factor limiting women, although Trump's Oval Office memorandum failed to mention this barrier.\n\nThe inclusion of compounding environmental factors was \"unprecedented\" and demonstrated that the plan's drafters listened to expert advice, said Lyric Thompson, director of policy and advocacy at the International Center for Research on Women.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\n\"I never intended this show to hurt anyone, except Ted Cruz.\"\n\nby Constance Grady\n\nOn Wednesday night, Samantha Bee elaborated on last week's apology for using a gendered slur to describe Ivanka Trump. In a thoughtful, very specific Full Frontal cold open, Bee explained exactly why she was sorry, who she was apologizing to - and who she wasn't.\n\nFirst, some background. Last week, during a segment about the United States' immigration policy and the 1,500 \"missing\" migrant children , Bee came under fire for calling Ivanka Trump a cunt . \"You know, Ivanka, that's a beautiful photo of you and your child,\" Bee said as the photo flashed onto the screen, \"but let me just say, one mother to another: Do something about your dad's immigration practices, you feckless cunt! He listens to you!\"\n\nThe moment faced harsh criticism, both from the White House, which called her statement \"vile and vicious,\" and from some on the left , who argued that calling women \"cunts\" reduces them to their genitalia and is a slur that's meant to teach women that their bodies are disgusting and shameful. (Bee also received praise from others on the left , who argued that cunt is just a word and that the real issue is Donald Trump's immigration practices.) In the wake of the backlash, Bee tweeted an apology to both Ivanka Trump and her viewers, saying, \"I crossed a line, and I deeply regret it.\"\n\nIn her segment on Wednesday night, Bee got more specific with her apology. Here are the takeaways.\n\nWhom she's apologizing to: Two groups of people. First, women who were offended. \"A lot of women have heard that word at the worst moment of their lives,\" Bee said. \"I don't want to inflict more pain on them. I want this show to be challenging and I want it to be honest, but I never intended it to hurt anyone, except Ted Cruz.\"\n\nSecond, the children affected by Donald Trump's juvenile immigration policy , which is what her segment was supposed to focus on before everyone got distracted by the c-word.\n\nWhat she's sorry about: First, Bee says that when she's used the word cunt on her show before, it's been as an attempt to reclaim the word and turn it into a badge of honor. Using it as an insult rather than reclaiming it, she says, crossed a line.\n\nSecond, she says she regrets that her use of the word meant that the news cycle paid less attention to the children dealing with Trump's immigration policy.\n\n\"I would do anything to help those kids,\" Bee said. \"I hate that this distracted from them.\"\n\nWhom she's not apologizing to: Men who were offended by her use of the word cunt . \"I do not care about that,\" Bee said.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nDJs, club owners, and patrons alike say there's way too much standing around.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nThe surprising truth about milk is hiding in plain sight.\n\n﻿From Dunkin' deodorant to Sabrina Carpenter perfume, smelling good isn't enough - it's all about smelling edible.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Libby Nelson\n\nIf you were going to groom a member of the Trump family for politics, your first instinct wouldn't necessarily be to pick Donald Trump - a 70-year-old with outrageous wealth and a penchant for saying outrageously racist things.\n\nYou might pick Ivanka Trump: his glamorous, accomplished, 34-year-old daughter, who is more disciplined and on-message on her worst day than her father on his best.\n\nSo perhaps it shouldn't be shocking that Ivanka's political star has quietly been on the rise over the past year. Before Donald Trump selected Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate, there were suggestions - occasionally serious - that he should pick Ivanka .\n\nBehind the scenes, Ivanka has amassed a surprising amount of influence within the Trump campaign. She was reportedly responsible for the ouster of controversial campaign manager Corey Lewandowski in June . Some sources suggested she was one of the deciding votes in her father's vice presidential pick. And Trump says she's helping develop his policy proposal on childcare - an issue he hasn't talked about during the campaign, but that she emphasized during her speech at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.\n\n\"She is very, very trusted by me,\" Trump told the New York Times in April . \"She has great real-estate instincts and great political instincts.\" Trump jumps at the chance to tell interviewers how great and accomplished his daughter is (though this fulsome praise often veers into his cringe-inducing joke that he'd date her if they weren't, you know, related).\n\nThe big question, then, is how Ivanka will wield this outsize influence within the Trump campaign. In some cases, she's garnered a reputation for trying to push her father to moderate his positions. Yet that doesn't seem to have succeeded thus far - and in at least a few instances, she's been unable to shake Donald Trump's core beliefs.\n\nIvanka first assumed a public role in her father's campaign in August 2015, when Trump was facing accusations of misogyny after he said that Fox News' Megyn Kelly had \"blood coming out of her ... wherever\" during a debate.\n\nInitially, Trump didn't see his feud with Kelly as a problem at all. It was Ivanka who convinced him that this was a real vulnerability and that he needed to address it. As Trump told Sean Hannity: \"She said, 'Dad, you've got to let people know how much you adore women and how you'll take care of them.'\"\n\nSince then, Ivanka has taken a leading role in trying to defend her father's reputation - a difficult task given Trump's long history of objectifying and denigrating women. She even told London's Sunday Times that her father was \"a feminist.\"\n\nAnd it's a big reason I am the woman I am today. He always told me and showed me that I could do anything I set my mind to if I married vision and passion with work ethic. He's also surrounded me with strong female role models who have done just that since I was a little girl... People talk about gender equality... He has lived it, he has employed women at the highest levels of the Trump Organization for decades, so I think it's a great testament to how capable he thinks women are and has shown that his whole life.\n\nWhile this defense wasn't entirely convincing, Ivanka was arguably his best messenger here. In addition to being an executive within the Trump Organization, she's an entrepreneur whose entire pitch is aimed at young women, selling a palatable, popular workplace feminism. Her website, IvankaTrump.com aims to give 20-somethings advice on how to choose an outfit for a summer wedding, write a living will, or ask for billions for your startup idea. Her forthcoming book is called Women Who Work.\n\nServing as a character witness is the traditional role for a male candidate's wife or daughter. Ivanka Trump's argument that her father \"adores\" women and will \"take care of them\" is similar to Ann Romney's role in the 2012 campaign, when she stood up at the Republican National Convention to tell a story about Mitt taking her to a high school dance. \"You can trust Mitt,\" she said . \"He will take us to a better place, just as he took me home safely from that dance.\"\n\nFor most wives and daughters, however, that's the extent of their campaign role. But Ivanka, along with her husband Jared Kushner, has slowly acquired an importance that stretches beyond simply telling heartwarming stories.\n\nFrom the beginning, the Trump campaign has featured a power struggle between the people who have worked with Trump the longest and the political operatives who were supposed to help him professionalize his candidacy.\n\nCaught between these dueling camps, it's not surprising that Trump has ultimately turned to his children as trusted arbiters. In October, Politico described Ivanka as the \"quiet power behind the Trump throne.\" The candidate reportedly huddled with his daughter during the debates. Meanwhile, the New York Times has described Ivanka's husband Jared Kushner as is the \"quiet fixer\" in the campaign.\n\nOver time, this influence has grown. In June, the Washington Post reported that Ivanka and Kushner, as well as Trump's other grown children, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., now play such a big role within the campaign that they're frequently in touch with officials from the Republican National Committee - jobs usually reserved for paid staff.\n\nIvanka and her siblings reportedly played a key role in Trump's pick for vice president. Time's Zeke Miller and Alex Altman quoted a campaign adviser who called the vice-presidential pick \"a family decision.\" When Trump began seriously considering Mike Pence as a running mate, Ivanka, Eric, Donald Jr., and Kushner joined him at a meeting with the Indiana governor .\n\nIvanka was also heavily involved when Trump finally decided to oust his trusted campaign manager Corey Lewandowski earlier this year. Trump had been fiercely loyal to his aide throughout the campaign - even standing by Lewandowski when the latter was charged with battery for violently grabbing a reporter from Breitbart News. To many observers, it looked like Lewandowski would be a permanent fixture on the campaign no matter what he did.\n\nUntil, that is, he made an enemy of Ivanka.\n\nAccording to New York magazine's Gabriel Sherman , Ivanka and her brother Eric were instrumental in convincing their father to fire Lewandowski. They ambushed the aide at a meeting and embarrassed him with questions about how badly the campaign was going. \"They went through the punch list,\" one source told Sherman. \"'Where are we with staffing? Where are we with getting the infrastructure built?'\"\n\nIt's unclear what Lewandowski had done, exactly, to earn Ivanka's wrath. One rumor had it that he'd been trying to plant negative stories about Kushner, his rival for Trump's ear, in the press. But it didn't matter. Ivanka reportedly gave her father an ultimatum - either fire Lewandowski or she would quit the campaign. Trump decided to fire Lewandowski.\n\nDonald Trump clearly trusts his daughter's instincts when it comes to tactical campaign decisions. But she's had far less success in talking him down from some of his extreme political stances.\n\nIt's hard to know what Ivanka's political beliefs are, though many suspect they are more liberal than her father's; she criticized President Barack Obama in 2012, but she also helped fundraise for New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker.\n\nIvanka Trump was reportedly upset by Trump's statement that Mexico was sending \"rapists\" to the United States during his initial campaign speech and, according to New York magazine , drafted several statements that would walk them back. But her father ignored her. Rather than retreat, he doubled down, making his promise to build a wall along the US-Mexico border the center of his quest for the nomination.\n\nSimilarly, Ivanka reportedly tried to soften Trump's attacks on Planned Parenthood - with extremely limited success. During a rambling primary victory speech, Trump did praise the organization's \"very good work for millions of women.\" It was the first time a prominent Republican candidate had said a good word about Planned Parenthood in years. And he credited Ivanka for that.\n\nBut ultimately, Ivanka didn't really sway any of Trump's substantive stances on this issue. He still promises to strip federal funding from the organization because it performs abortion services. And he picked Pence, the GOP's most prominent anti-Planned Parenthood warrior , as his running mate. Ivanka's influence appears much more likely to be cosmetic than policy-based.\n\n\"Ivanka is so much into that whole issue of women's health and women, and she's my guide on that whole subject,\" Trump told Hannity in August. \"But,\" he added, \"she understands how I feel about it.\"\n\nFor her part, Ivanka rarely defends her father's specific positions - she just reiterates that he's a good-hearted person and that people like it when he speaks his mind. \"He's my father and I love him and I fully support him,\" she told Town and Country this year, proving that Trump's unquestioning loyalty to his children might not be misplaced.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue. But the benefits of fighting his lawless deportations are worth the political risks.\n\nTrade wars are easy to win - if you're China.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nCanary Mission, the controversial organization targeting student activists, explained.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

And Trump says she's helping develop his policy proposal on childcare - an issue he hasn't talked about during the campaign, but that she emphasized during her speech at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.\n\n\"She is very, very trusted by me,\" Trump told the New York Times in April . \"She has great real-estate instincts and great political instincts.\" Trump jumps at the chance to tell interviewers how great and accomplished his daughter is (though this fulsome praise often veers into his cringe-inducing joke that he'd date her if they weren't, you know, related).\n\nThe big question, then, is how Ivanka will wield this outsize influence within the Trump campaign. In some cases, she's garnered a reputation for trying to push her father to moderate his positions. Yet that doesn't seem to have succeeded thus far - and in at least a few instances, she's been unable to shake Donald Trump's core beliefs.\n\nIvanka first assumed a public role in her father's campaign in August 2015, when Trump was facing accusations of misogyny after he said that Fox News' Megyn Kelly had \"blood coming out of her ... wherever\" during a debate.\n\nInitially, Trump didn't see his feud with Kelly as a problem at all. It was Ivanka who convinced him that this was a real vulnerability and that he needed to address it. As Trump told Sean Hannity: \"She said, 'Dad, you've got to let people know how much you adore women and how you'll take care of them.'\"\n\nSince then, Ivanka has taken a leading role in trying to defend her father's reputation - a difficult task given Trump's long history of objectifying and denigrating women. She even told London's Sunday Times that her father was \"a feminist.\"\n\nAnd it's a big reason I am the woman I am today. He always told me and showed me that I could do anything I set my mind to if I married vision and passion with work ethic. He's also surrounded me with strong female role models who have done just that since I was a little girl... People talk about gender equality... He has lived it, he has employed women at the highest levels of the Trump Organization for decades, so I think it's a great testament to how capable he thinks women are and has shown that his whole life.\n\nWhile this defense wasn't entirely convincing, Ivanka was arguably his best messenger here. In addition to being an executive within the Trump Organization, she's an entrepreneur whose entire pitch is aimed at young women, selling a palatable, popular workplace feminism. Her website, IvankaTrump.com aims to give 20-somethings advice on how to choose an outfit for a summer wedding, write a living will, or ask for billions for your startup idea. Her forthcoming book is called Women Who Work.\n\nServing as a character witness is the traditional role for a male candidate's wife or daughter. Ivanka Trump's argument that her father \"adores\" women and will \"take care of them\" is similar to Ann Romney's role in the 2012 campaign, when she stood up at the Republican National Convention to tell a story about Mitt taking her to a high school dance. \"You can trust Mitt,\" she said . \"He will take us to a better place, just as he took me home safely from that dance.\"\n\nFor most wives and daughters, however, that's the extent of their campaign role. But Ivanka, along with her husband Jared Kushner, has slowly acquired an importance that stretches beyond simply telling heartwarming stories.\n\nFrom the beginning, the Trump campaign has featured a power struggle between the people who have worked with Trump the longest and the political operatives who were supposed to help him professionalize his candidacy.\n\nCaught between these dueling camps, it's not surprising that Trump has ultimately turned to his children as trusted arbiters. In October, Politico described Ivanka as the \"quiet power behind the Trump throne.\" The candidate reportedly huddled with his daughter during the debates. Meanwhile, the New York Times has described Ivanka's husband Jared Kushner as is the \"quiet fixer\" in the campaign.\n\nOver time, this influence has grown. In June, the Washington Post reported that Ivanka and Kushner, as well as Trump's other grown children, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., now play such a big role within the campaign that they're frequently in touch with officials from the Republican National Committee - jobs usually reserved for paid staff.\n\nIvanka and her siblings reportedly played a key role in Trump's pick for vice president. Time's Zeke Miller and Alex Altman quoted a campaign adviser who called the vice-presidential pick \"a family decision.\" When Trump began seriously considering Mike Pence as a running mate, Ivanka, Eric, Donald Jr., and Kushner joined him at a meeting with the Indiana governor .\n\nIvanka was also heavily involved when Trump finally decided to oust his trusted campaign manager Corey Lewandowski earlier this year. Trump had been fiercely loyal to his aide throughout the campaign - even standing by Lewandowski when the latter was charged with battery for violently grabbing a reporter from Breitbart News. To many observers, it looked like Lewandowski would be a permanent fixture on the campaign no matter what he did.\n\nUntil, that is, he made an enemy of Ivanka.\n\nAccording to New York magazine's Gabriel Sherman , Ivanka and her brother Eric were instrumental in convincing their father to fire Lewandowski. They ambushed the aide at a meeting and embarrassed him with questions about how badly the campaign was going. \"They went through the punch list,\" one source told Sherman. \"'Where are we with staffing? Where are we with getting the infrastructure built?'\"\n\nIt's unclear what Lewandowski had done, exactly, to earn Ivanka's wrath. One rumor had it that he'd been trying to plant negative stories about Kushner, his rival for Trump's ear, in the press. But it didn't matter. Ivanka reportedly gave her father an ultimatum - either fire Lewandowski or she would quit the campaign. Trump decided to fire Lewandowski.\n\nDonald Trump clearly trusts his daughter's instincts when it comes to tactical campaign decisions. But she's had far less success in talking him down from some of his extreme political stances.\n\nIt's hard to know what Ivanka's political beliefs are, though many suspect they are more liberal than her father's; she criticized President Barack Obama in 2012, but she also helped fundraise for New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker.\n\nIvanka Trump was reportedly upset by Trump's statement that Mexico was sending \"rapists\" to the United States during his initial campaign speech and, according to New York magazine , drafted several statements that would walk them back. But her father ignored her. Rather than retreat, he doubled down, making his promise to build a wall along the US-Mexico border the center of his quest for the nomination.\n\nSimilarly, Ivanka reportedly tried to soften Trump's attacks on Planned Parenthood - with extremely limited success. During a rambling primary victory speech, Trump did praise the organization's \"very good work for millions of women.\" It was the first time a prominent Republican candidate had said a good word about Planned Parenthood in years. And he credited Ivanka for that.\n\nBut ultimately, Ivanka didn't really sway any of Trump's substantive stances on this issue. He still promises to strip federal funding from the organization because it performs abortion services. And he picked Pence, the GOP's most prominent anti-Planned Parenthood warrior , as his running mate. Ivanka's influence appears much more likely to be cosmetic than policy-based.\n\n\"Ivanka is so much into that whole issue of women's health and women, and she's my guide on that whole subject,\" Trump told Hannity in August. \"But,\" he added, \"she understands how I feel about it.\"\n\nFor her part, Ivanka rarely defends her father's specific positions - she just reiterates that he's a good-hearted person and that people like it when he speaks his mind. \"He's my father and I love him and I fully support him,\" she told Town and Country this year, proving that Trump's unquestioning loyalty to his children might not be misplaced.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Videos and photos of immigrant kids detained - some even locked in cages - paint a disturbing picture of the United States federal government's \"zero tolerance\" policy in stopping asylum seekers and immigrants at the border. A number of figures on both sides of the aisle have spoken out against the administration's practices.\n\nIvanka Trump, who was supposed to be the voice for children and family issues in the Trump administration, has said nothing. Trump, 36, spent Monday attending a pair of fundraising events with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy in California. The pair pulled in $3.1 million for a fundraising committee that boosts vulnerable House Republicans, according to Politico's Playbook .\n\nTrump wasn't that far from the border - the trip from Los Angeles to Tijuana is about a three-hour drive - but she stayed far away from the family separation crisis.\n\nShe hasn't released any statements or publicly weighed in on her father's \"zero tolerance\" policy that is resulting in hundreds of children being separated from their parents. There haven't even been the usual leaks of how distraught she and her husband, Jared Kushner, are behind closed doors.\n\nHer Twitter account over the past week has fired off a handful of generic messages, celebrating the US's successful bid for the World Cup in 2026, touting women's responsible borrowing habits , and quoting a Chinese proverb . Some of Trump's social media activity has celebrated the closeness of her family in a way critics have called tone-deaf: a birthday wish to her father, a Father's Day salute to her husband and her dad, a picture of her holding her son.\n\nThe White House told CNN that Trump had met with her father on Tuesday to discuss the \"images of families being separated at the US-Mexico border\" and offer her support to talk to members of Congress to find a legislative solution. She reportedly called McCarthy and Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME). The president also talked about Ivanka during a meeting with GOP lawmakers on Tuesday evening and said she had encouraged him to stop separating families. Trump insists he wants Congress to fix the problem, even though he could do it himself.\n\nAt the end of May, TBS host Samantha Bee was caught in a firestorm over calling Ivanka Trump a \"feckless cunt.\" What was lost in the uproar over Bee's language was the message she was trying to get across: that Ivanka is nowhere to be seen on her father's immigration policies.\n\nThe comedian's segment was on the 1,500 \"missing\" migrant children under the Trump administration and Ivanka's seeming obliviousness to it as she Instagrammed pictures of herself with her own kids.\n\n\"You know, Ivanka, that's a beautiful photo of you and your child,\" Bee said as a photo flashed onto the screen, \"but let me just say, one more to another: Do something about your dad's immigration practices, you feckless cunt! He listens to you!\"\n\nThere has long been a perception that Ivanka is some sort of \"moderating force\" to her father and that she and Kushner serve as voices of reason within the White House. But there's little evidence to actually back up that claim.\n\nIvanka and Jared are often nowhere to be found during big moments in the Trump presidency. They were skiing when his first Obamacare repeal push floundered. While the president was defending racists in Charlottesville, Virginia, they were on vacation in Vermont. They didn't keep Trump from pulling out of the Paris climate agreement. They didn't get him to moderate his Charlottesville stance or stop him from scrapping the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program .\n\nDuring protests against Trump's travel ban, Ivanka posted on Instagram a picture of herself and Jared dressed up to go to a party.\n\nThe first daughter told the Financial Times in September that some people have created \"unrealistic expectations\" for her power in the White House. \"That my presence in and of itself would carry so much weight with my father that he would abandon his core values and the agenda that the American people voted for when they elected him,\" she said.\n\nAnd on plenty of matters, Trump has been with her father - including on items that are supposed to be part of her pro-women, pro-children platform. She backed Trump's move to get rid of an Obama-era initiative meant to close the gender pay gap in August. After the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, she said arming teachers with guns is \" an idea that needs to be discussed .\"\n\nIn early 2017, Saturday Night Live ran a parody perfume ad called \" Complicit ,\" featuring Scarlett Johansson as Ivanka Trump.\n\nIn a subsequent interview with CBS News , Trump responded to the sketch, saying that if being complicit is \"wanting to be a force for good,\" then she is. \"I don't know what it means to be complicit, but you know, I hope time will prove that I have done a good job and, much more importantly, that my father's administration is the success that I know it will be,\" she said.\n\nI exchanged emails with two White House spokespeople asking about Ivanka Trump's stance on family separation and her activities in recent days and have not yet received any answers. But Trump has a habit of toggling between the role of distant first daughter and shrewd policy adviser, depending on when it's convenient for her.\n\nIn a February interview with NBC News's Peter Alexander , she scolded the interviewer for asking about the multiple women who have accused her father of sexual harassment and assault . She said it was a \"pretty inappropriate question to ask a daughter.\"\n\nDuring the same interview, she discussed the relationship between the US and North Korea. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly reportedly griped around the same time that Trump seemed to be \" playing government .\"\n\nThe best case for her silence right now is that she's oblivious. It wouldn't be the first time she's been accused of being tone-deaf. She and her husband snapped smiling pictures at the opening of the US Embassy in Jerusalem last month as violence erupted just miles away. In January, she attempted to piggyback on Oprah Winfrey's Golden Globes speech and join in on #MeToo and Time's Up.\n\nStill, even first lady Melania Trump has weighed in on the family separation matter, in a statement from her spokesperson saying she \"hates\" to see parents separated from their children and calling for a country that \"governs with heart.\"\n\nThe first lady said \"both sides\" need to come together for a fix, apparently siding with her husband's false assertion that Democrats are at fault for what's happening, in one of her rare statements on public policy.\n\nIt's still more than Ivanka - the supposed advocate for children and families - has done.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

The president also talked about Ivanka during a meeting with GOP lawmakers on Tuesday evening and said she had encouraged him to stop separating families. Trump insists he wants Congress to fix the problem, even though he could do it himself.\n\nAt the end of May, TBS host Samantha Bee was caught in a firestorm over calling Ivanka Trump a \"feckless cunt.\" What was lost in the uproar over Bee's language was the message she was trying to get across: that Ivanka is nowhere to be seen on her father's immigration policies.\n\nThe comedian's segment was on the 1,500 \"missing\" migrant children under the Trump administration and Ivanka's seeming obliviousness to it as she Instagrammed pictures of herself with her own kids.\n\n\"You know, Ivanka, that's a beautiful photo of you and your child,\" Bee said as a photo flashed onto the screen, \"but let me just say, one more to another: Do something about your dad's immigration practices, you feckless cunt! He listens to you!\"\n\nThere has long been a perception that Ivanka is some sort of \"moderating force\" to her father and that she and Kushner serve as voices of reason within the White House. But there's little evidence to actually back up that claim.\n\nIvanka and Jared are often nowhere to be found during big moments in the Trump presidency. They were skiing when his first Obamacare repeal push floundered. While the president was defending racists in Charlottesville, Virginia, they were on vacation in Vermont. They didn't keep Trump from pulling out of the Paris climate agreement. They didn't get him to moderate his Charlottesville stance or stop him from scrapping the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program .\n\nDuring protests against Trump's travel ban, Ivanka posted on Instagram a picture of herself and Jared dressed up to go to a party.\n\nThe first daughter told the Financial Times in September that some people have created \"unrealistic expectations\" for her power in the White House. \"That my presence in and of itself would carry so much weight with my father that he would abandon his core values and the agenda that the American people voted for when they elected him,\" she said.\n\nAnd on plenty of matters, Trump has been with her father - including on items that are supposed to be part of her pro-women, pro-children platform. She backed Trump's move to get rid of an Obama-era initiative meant to close the gender pay gap in August. After the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, she said arming teachers with guns is \" an idea that needs to be discussed .\"\n\nIn early 2017, Saturday Night Live ran a parody perfume ad called \" Complicit ,\" featuring Scarlett Johansson as Ivanka Trump.\n\nIn a subsequent interview with CBS News , Trump responded to the sketch, saying that if being complicit is \"wanting to be a force for good,\" then she is. \"I don't know what it means to be complicit, but you know, I hope time will prove that I have done a good job and, much more importantly, that my father's administration is the success that I know it will be,\" she said.\n\nI exchanged emails with two White House spokespeople asking about Ivanka Trump's stance on family separation and her activities in recent days and have not yet received any answers. But Trump has a habit of toggling between the role of distant first daughter and shrewd policy adviser, depending on when it's convenient for her.\n\nIn a February interview with NBC News's Peter Alexander , she scolded the interviewer for asking about the multiple women who have accused her father of sexual harassment and assault . She said it was a \"pretty inappropriate question to ask a daughter.\"\n\nDuring the same interview, she discussed the relationship between the US and North Korea. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly reportedly griped around the same time that Trump seemed to be \" playing government .\"\n\nThe best case for her silence right now is that she's oblivious. It wouldn't be the first time she's been accused of being tone-deaf. She and her husband snapped smiling pictures at the opening of the US Embassy in Jerusalem last month as violence erupted just miles away. In January, she attempted to piggyback on Oprah Winfrey's Golden Globes speech and join in on #MeToo and Time's Up.\n\nStill, even first lady Melania Trump has weighed in on the family separation matter, in a statement from her spokesperson saying she \"hates\" to see parents separated from their children and calling for a country that \"governs with heart.\"\n\nThe first lady said \"both sides\" need to come together for a fix, apparently siding with her husband's false assertion that Democrats are at fault for what's happening, in one of her rare statements on public policy.\n\nIt's still more than Ivanka - the supposed advocate for children and families - has done.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThis whopper shows how Trump's lies take on a life of their own.\n\nby Aaron Rupar\n\nFrom Donald Trump's 2017 presidential inauguration through the end of November 2019, the American economy added a total of about 6.2 million jobs . But during a speech at a White House event on paid family leave on Thursday, the president credited his daughter, Ivanka Trump, with personally creating more than twice as many jobs over the same timespan.\n\n\"14 million people she's gotten jobs for,\" Trump said, referring to Ivanka. \"Her goal when she started it two years ago was 500,000 jobs. She's done over 14 million, so that's really something.\"\n\nThis wasn't the first time Trump lauded his daughter in this way - he made the same claim during a speech to the Economic Club of New York last month. The problem, however, is that the entire American economy hasn't even added half as many jobs as Trump is giving Ivanka credit for creating.\n\nTo be clear, the economy isn't in bad shape , even if Trump's jobs record to date lags behind that of Barack Obama . While GDP growth so far this year has been unspectacular and wages are stagnant, the unemployment rate is at a 50-year low. That means that people who want to find a job can, for the most part, find a job. But there isn't a shred of evidence that Ivanka has created a single one of them, much less tens of millions - aside from, perhaps, the 18 people who worked for her namesake fashion brand before she shut it down in July 2018.\n\nThe workforce policy board Ivanka co-chairs works with private companies to get them to offer training opportunities to workers. According to the Washington Post's Fact Checker , the fruit of that effort has been companies offering more than 6.5 million training opportunities to workers. That's nothing to sneeze at - workforce development is important - but a training opportunity is not the same thing as an actual job.\n\nTrump, however, is conflating the two - and in this example, he has seemingly rubbed off on his daughter. Speaking at a White House event in October 2018, Ivanka alluded to the training opportunities created with the help of her workforce policy board, saying , \"We're up to 6.3 million new jobs. That represents 5 percent of the current workforce. So it's really remarkable.\" Again, though, a training opportunity is not a job.\n\nNot only is Trump's claim about Ivanka and job creation totally absurd, it also illustrates how some of his lies grow more outlandish over time as he gradually embellishes them.\n\nDuring a White House event in February, Trump claimed Ivanka \" has created millions of jobs .\" That claim was obviously false and prompted the aforementioned article in the Washington Post's Fact Checker. By July, however, Trump had added a veneer of specificity to his fib when he said Ivanka \" has worked on almost 10 million jobs .\" Now, on Trump's third telling, not only has Ivanka \"worked on\" jobs, but the number she's supposedly directly responsible for creating has been jacked up all the way to 14 million.\n\nThis sort of lie escalation is commonplace for Trump. In fact, a similar dynamic was on display during another speech he delivered in New York in November, when he bragged about how tariffs are hurting the Chinese economy.\n\nTo cite another example, I detailed in October how it took Trump mere weeks to go from saying America \"was very low on ammunition\" when he took office to later making the even more absurd claim that \"when I took over our military, we did not have ammunition.\"\n\nIn November, Trump tweeted on Twitter that his election-eve rally in Kentucky helped \"lift the poll numbers of Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin by 19 points\" - a false claim even more outlandish than the one he initially made after the election, in which he tried to take credit for Bevin not losing by a wider margin than he did by claiming his rally helped Bevin \"[pick] up at least 15 points in [the] last day.\" (The last poll conducted before the Kentucky election actually showed Bevin ahead by five points.)\n\nOf course, it's not exactly breaking news that Trump's truth barometer is broken beyond repair. As of August, he had made more than 12,000 false or misleading claims over the course of his presidency. In November, I wrote about how he's willing to lie even in situations where the most cursory examination of what he's saying proves that he's fibbing .\n\nBut Trump's lie on Thursday, about Ivanka creating more jobs than have been added to the entire American economy since he took office, shows how he just can't help himself. He builds on his lies until what he's saying becomes so untethered from reality that it's impossible to take seriously.

She said it was a \"pretty inappropriate question to ask a daughter.\"\n\nDuring the same interview, she discussed the relationship between the US and North Korea. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly reportedly griped around the same time that Trump seemed to be \" playing government .\"\n\nThe best case to explain her silence in recent days is that she was oblivious. It wouldn't be the first time she's been accused of being tone-deaf.

In January, she attempted to piggyback on Oprah Winfrey's Golden Globes speech and join in on #MeToo and Time's Up.\n\nStill, even first lady Melania Trump weighed in on the family separation matter before the executive order, in a statement from her spokesperson saying she \"hates\" to see parents separated from their children and calling for a country that \"governs with heart.\"\n\nThe first lady said \"both sides\" need to come together for a fix, apparently siding with her husband's false assertion that Democrats are at fault for what's happening, in one of her rare statements on public policy.\n\nIt's still more than Ivanka - the supposed advocate for children and families - did.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Libby Nelson\n\nIvanka Trump's power behind the scenes in the White House is now really, truly official. The president's daughter, who already had a West Wing Office, a security clearance, and a government-issued phone, will become an unpaid government employee with the title of special assistant to the president, according to the New York Times .\n\nThat title is a shift from her earlier plans, which would have given her the office and the clearance without the official status. As a White House employee, even an unpaid one, Trump, like her husband, Jared Kushner, will have to abide by federal ethics regulations.\n\nHer appointment is pure nepotism: There is nothing on her résumé that suggests Ivanka Trump is qualified, by any traditional definition of the term, to advise the president of the United States. But for President Donald Trump she has two qualities that likely outweigh any others - she's a Trump, and she's going to be loyal to him.\n\nIvanka Trump, who is 35 and has a bachelor's degree in business, is best known for running a relatively small apparel line branded with her name, for appearing on The Apprentice and The Celebrity Apprentice alongside her father, and for writing a memoir/career advice book, The Trump Card.\n\nBy all accounts, she was a capable lieutenant to her father at the Trump Organization, where she oversaw global expansion and the development of the president's hotel in Washington, DC's Old Post Office building. Still, this is not the type of résumé most White House jobs are built on. She'll have access to well-guarded information about national security, and, according to Politico, her portfolio of issues won't be confined to the family policy she spent most of her campaign trail time discussing.\n\nIvanka Trump's role, her lawyer told Politico, is to be her father's \"eyes and ears\" in the White House. In an administration that spent its first two months riven by very public leaks and infighting, Trump has apparently decided, as he did in his business career, that his own children are the only people he can really trust.\n\nGiving Ivanka Trump a West Wing office might be nepotism. But it's not illegal nepotism. The Justice Department ruled that federal anti-nepotism laws don't apply to the president's choice of White House advisers. The day Trump was inaugurated, the Justice Department determined that it would be legal for him to appoint Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and Ivanka Trump's husband.\n\n\"A President wanting a relative's advice on governmental matters therefore has a choice: to seek that advice on an unofficial, ad hoc basis without conferring the status and imposing the responsibilities that accompany formal White House positions,\" the Justice Department's Daniel Koffsky , a deputy assistant attorney general, wrote, \"or to appoint his relative to the White House under title 3 and subject him to substantial restrictions against conflicts of interest.\"\n\nIn other words: Trump is going to get advice from his relatives anyway, so he might as well get it in a role that puts some ethical restrictions around what they can do.\n\nCongress passed a federal anti-nepotism law in the 1960s. Before that, the only unusual thing about an appointment like Trump's would be that she was the president's daughter - not the president's brother or the president's son.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy made his brother Robert attorney general and put his brother-in-law, Sargent Shriver, in charge of the Peace Corps. Dwight D. Eisenhower's son worked in the White House as an assistant staff secretary. Franklin D. Roosevelt's son James served as secretary of the president, an important coordinating job akin to the modern position of chief of staff. (In an episode with additional resonance for Trump watchers, James Roosevelt was also accused of profiting personally from his father's presidency and had to publish his tax returns to prove he had not.)\n\nThen in 1967, a federal anti-nepotism law reforming the Post Office prohibited executive branch officials from appointing their relatives to jobs in the agencies they oversee. Legal experts disagree on whether the law applies to the president and to jobs in the White House. But some presidents have decided to play it safe: When President Bill Clinton tapped Hillary Clinton to oversee his health care overhaul, he put her in charge of a task force rather than giving her an official White House job.\n\nToday, Kushner and Ivanka Trump have already disclosed information about their finances and divested from some stocks as part of Kushner's White House role, according to Politico . As an official White House employee, she'll also be bound by regulations on financial disclosures and conflicts of interest.\n\nSince the campaign, Ivanka Trump has assiduously cultivated an image as the voice of moderation, even liberalism, whispering in her father's ear. It reached its pinnacle when she told the Republican National Convention that her father believed in affordable child care and equal pay for equal work - issues that a Republican president had never put at the center of his campaign.\n\nThat influence had limits: Trump has not made child care the center of his legislative agenda. Still, for the observers and pundits who constantly scan for a \"pivot,\" a sign that Trump is moving away from his most extreme positions and rhetoric, there will be a temptation to interpret Ivanka Trump's West Wing office as the latest sign of moderation. Kushner, as well as fellow New Yorkers Gary Cohn and Dina Powell, former Goldman Sachs executives, are seen as the moderate voices in the Trump administration; according to the Washington Post's Philip Rucker and Robert Costa , their rivals have taken to calling them \"the Democrats.\"\n\nThe narrative of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner nudging the president to the center can be overblown. But Kushner, Trump, and their allies have leaked to reporters a counterfactual history of how much more extreme Trump's decisions would have been if they weren't there to put on the brakes.\n\nAccording to media reports, Kushner and Trump pushed for an executive order on climate to be less critical of the Paris climate deal. Another report has them successfully derailing another executive order that would have made it easier for businesses to discriminate against LGBTQ people. Ivanka Trump, according to reports, persuaded her father to embrace the less bellicose tone he employed in his speech to a joint session of Congress, rather than the bleak imagery from his inaugural address. She attended a play about welcoming immigrants with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nThe image of Kushner and Ivanka Trump as the (relatively) progressive adults in the room is so enduring that for the first few weeks of Trump's presidency, political observers even held them responsible for the presidents' tweets. A slew of speculative articles suggested the president tended to send his most zany tweets on Friday nights and Saturdays because Trump and Kushner, who are Orthodox Jews, were observing Shabbat and weren't there to stop him.\n\nRabbis, including the rabbi who oversaw Ivanka Trump's conversion to Judaism, finally debunked this interpretation: Nothing is stopping Kushner and his wife from talking about the president's tweets, even during the religious observance, they told Politico .\n\nMore broadly, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner might be winning occasional battles. But if their goal is to shape President Trump's administration into one that actively fights climate change and protects the rights of LGBTQ people, they're losing the war.\n\nThe Trump administration is trying to eliminate the federal government's ability to oppose climate change through its budget. It abolished protections for transgender students in K-12 schools. If Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner truly felt these were morally monstrous decisions, they could resign.\n\nInstead, they've been able to have their cake and eat it too: participating in the administration that set these policy moves in motion, while making themselves the stars of a narrative about the people who tried to stand up to them.\n\nThe most likely explanation for Ivanka's new office and security clearance, though, isn't that Trump is beefing up the moderate faction within his administration. It's that despite his claims to hire the \"best people,\" the only people Trump ever really trusts are those related to him by blood or marriage.\n\nIt's easy to understand why Trump might feel like he needs \"eyes and ears,\" the role Ivanka is supposed to play, in the West Wing. Usually an incoming presidential administration is at least somewhat united by a common purpose, and doesn't degenerate into public kvetching and backstabbing until it's suffered some setbacks. Trump's administration got there in less than a week.\n\nThe White House and federal agencies have both a below-average number of employees and an above-average number of factions, all of whom apparently spend an inordinate amount of time on the phone to reporters leaking unflattering details about one another. The situation is so bad that several meetings meant to crack down on leaking have immediately been reported in full by the media after details about the anti-leaking meetings were leaked.\n\n\"Hire the best people,\" Donald Trump wrote in his 2007 book Think Big and Kick Ass , \"and don't trust them.\" Trump's definition of the \"best people\" is idiosyncratic at best. But in business and throughout the campaign, he leans on his family to an unusual degree. Trump's three grown children - Eric, Donald Jr., and Ivanka - are in their 30s and 40s, but they all work for their father. When he stepped away from the day-to-day operations of his company to serve as president, Donald Trump put Eric and Donald Jr. in charge.\n\nAnother president who wants a loyal lieutenant in the West Wing might pick a longtime colleague or even a friend, as Barack Obama did with Valerie Jarrett.

      "text": "Trump's USAID cuts threaten women's empowerment program championed by daughter Ivanka\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nFebruary 10, 2025 / 12:11 PM EST / CBS News\n\nPresident Trump and Elon Musk's attempt to gut the decades-old USAID agency is likely to end millions of dollars in U.S. funding earmarked for women's economic empowerment across the globe, including programs championed during Mr. Trump's first term by his daughter Ivanka.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump's bid to put virtually all of the agency's workers on leave is currently tied up in a U.S. court battle, the pause ordered by Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the end of January on all new U.S. foreign assistance programs funded by the State Department and USAID remains in place .\n\nThe Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative was intended to help 50 million women \"realize their economic potential\" by 2025, an issue the president's daughter called at the time a crucial area in which Republicans and Democrats could find common ground.\n\nLillian Achom was a projects manager for AFCHIX, a network for women in technology, that was part of USAID's Women Connect Challenge. In 2019, she was invited to the White House to meet Ivanka Trump, who was then an advisor to her father, and to attend the W-GDP announcement.\n\nTo coincide with the launch, Ivanka Trump wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed in which she said W-GDP would, \"for the first time coordinate America's commitment to one of the most undervalued resources in the developing world - the talent, ambition and genius of women.\"\n\nAchom was one of nine grantees who were invited to the White House, where President Trump signed the memorandum in the Oval House on February 7, 2019. Mr. Trump's administration pledged $50 million to W-GDP - to be allocated by USAID.\n\nAchom told CBS News on Monday that while the president had made supportive comments about the initiative, Ivanka \"was somebody who really cared,\" saying the president's daughter seemed genuinely concerned about women's development and economic empowerment.\n\n\"I could see that she really loves stories of our success, stories of how women are impacting communities around the globe,\" Achom said.\n\nThe first Trump administration later said the program had reached 12 million women in its first year. The Biden administration continued W-GDP's work under the Gender Equity and Equality Action Fund, which invested $300 million in direct resources and another $200 million in indirect funding between 2021 and 2023, according to USAID documents provided to CBS News.\n\nIvanka Trump did not immediately reply to a CBS News request for comment on the program or the USAID funding cuts.\n\nA State Department spokesperson, asked about the W-GDP program, noted to CBS News Rubio's review of foreign assistance programs, \"to ensure they are efficient and consistent with U.S. foreign policy under the America First agenda.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said the department was \"judiciously reviewing all the waivers submitted\" by various programs and personnel in a bid to keep aid flowing, and they said the results would be communicated \"transparently.\"\n\nOne of the focuses of the W-GDP program was women's access to technology, which still lags behind that of men globally. According to White House documents from the time, more than 1.7 billion women in low and middle-income countries did not own a mobile phone, and they were far less likely to use mobile internet.\n\nRural communities in Africa have been less able to access new and emerging technologies, Achom explained, because of the cost of the internet and devices, but also because for many people, medical bills, education, and food remain the priorities.\n\nIn northern Uganda, where the prevalence of HIV among women and children has historically been higher than in other parts of the country, additional USAID funding provided through the aid relief program, PEPFAR , gave communities access to ongoing supplies of antiretroviral drugs. Such support is limited from Uganda's own government because of its restrained finances, Achom said.\n\n\"USAID has really treated those in the community like their friend,\" she said. \"Like their number one friend, I should say, because they've visited them, they've given them grants, not only to support them with medical facilities and access to medicine, but to access economic empowerment.\"\n\nUSAID funding was also consistent and reliable, unlike some other programs, and shutting down agency-funded programs, Achom said, will affect more than just women's access to technology.\n\n\"The ability of the entire community to move out of poverty is really going to be slowed down or compromised,\" she told CBS News.\n\nJoanne Stocker is a verification producer for CBS News Confirmed. She was previously chief editor of Kurdistan 24 English and managing editor at The Defense Post. She has combined open-source investigation methods with on-the-ground reporting to cover conflict, terrorism, and misinformation for over 15 years.\n\n© 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "Ivanka Trump called to stand to testify in New York fraud trial\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  November 8, 2023 / 10:48 PM EST / CBS News\n\nIvanka Trump testified in the ongoing civil fraud trial of her father and his business in New York on Wednesday, the fourth and final member of the Trump family to take the stand.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's eldest daughter is not a defendant in her family's fraud trial. Evidence presented in court Wednesday indicated she was involved in at least one deal during her time at the Trump Organization that was facilitated by a document that inflated her father's net worth. Trump submitted the 2011 financial statement, which was meant to be a snapshot of his wealth at the time, to a bank executive and copied Ivanka Trump, who was negotiating a loan.\n\nIvanka Trump is appearing two days after her father testified for four tense hours , repeatedly lashing out at the judge overseeing the case and New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nDonald Trump and two of his sons are accused of a decade of fraud tied to false inflation of his net worth and the value of Trump Organization properties. Ivanka Trump was an executive at the Trump Organization until 2017, when she left to join her father in the White House. She was originally a defendant in the lawsuit, but a New York appellate court dismissed claims against her in June, ruling that they were barred by the state's statute of limitations.\n\nLouis Solomon, a lawyer from the attorney general's office, opened the testimony by asking Ivanka Trump about her work history and involvement in a variety of business deals for the Trump Organization.\n\nSolomon soon turned to a statement of financial condition from 2011 that described her father's assets. Trump enclosed the document in a letter to Deutsche Bank's then-CEO while Ivanka Trump was leading negotiations for a loan related to a Florida golf course. The judge has already found that the statement portrayed Trump's wealth as far higher than it actually was.\n\nOne month later, the bank offered a deal with significantly better loan rates than the Trump Organization had previously been offered.\n\n\"It doesn't get better than this,\" Ivanka Trump wrote in one email, forwarding the offer to other Trump Organization executives.\n\nEarlier in the trial, a former Deutsche Bank executive who analyzed risk for loans to high-net-worth individuals testified that the bank relied on, at least in part, the statement of financial condition that year.\n\n\"I assumed that the representations of the value of the assets and liabilities were broadly accurate,\" said Nicholas Haigh, the executive.\n\nIvanka Trump said she didn't recall sending the email, or seeing the letter to the bank CEO. The deal involved a loan for the Trump National Doral golf course in Florida, one of her two biggest projects while working for her father's company.\n\nShe maintained more than a dozen times that she had forgotten many of the details from her negotiations related to loans that buttressed her father's effort to buy the course. Her recollection of many interactions and meetings, she said, extended only to what she had been shown by James' office during an August 2022 deposition.\n\nAsked about discussions with her father related to the deal, she said she remembered them only because of the deposition.\n\n\"I recall you showed me, I think, a letter from my father,\" Ivanka Trump said.\n\nAnd asked about negotiations related to key loan terms, her memory faltered.\n\n\"I think it would be hard for me to answer that question sitting here today, all of these years removed,\" Ivanka Trump said.\n\nOne of those instances involved an unsuccessful effort in February 2016, while Donald Trump was vying for the Republican presidential nomination, to increase a credit line she previously negotiated for him. The bank declined, citing his candidacy.\n\n\"At the end, it came down to a global corporate decision to maintain neutrality to any political situation and not lend money to a highly politically exposed person,\" a bank executive wrote in an email to Ivanka Trump.\n\nThat exhibit and others presented Wednesday were challenged by lawyers for the defendants, who argued it was unclear why Ivanka Trump was on the stand discussing the loan, since she is not also a defendant.\n\nSolomon, the lawyer for James' office, said the state had already shown she was crucial to a banking relationship at the center of the state's case against her family.\n\n\"She's negotiating the deal from top to bottom,\" Solomon said.\n\nAsked if her father discussed his financial statements during a meeting with government officials before the Trumps took over the Old Post Office property in Washington, D.C., Ivanka said she could not remember. She then described several other details about the meeting, and what she said Donald Trump spoke about.\n\nThe response raised Solomon's ire, and he asked the judge to strike most of what she said.\n\n\"She just spent three minutes describing the Plaza Hotel - how it's similar to this, how her father spoke about this, how people speak about that - but she has no recollection when I ask her a question,\" Solomon said.\n\nIvanka Trump was the only one of the four Trumps who testified who was also cross-examined by lawyers for the defense. They showed exhibits that appeared to indicate Deutsche Bank was as interested in cultivating a relationship with the Trumps and Ivanka as the family was with the bank.\n\nIvanka Trump described a banker who oversaw the bank's relationship with her family, Rosemary Vrablic, as someone she aspired to work with.\n\n\"She had an incredible reputation after a long career in the banking industry and was considered a very reputable, solid lender,\" Ivanka Trump said.\n\nTensions boiled over in the afternoon, after the defense and state argued over the admissibility of defense exhibits. Trump attorney Jesus Suarez interrupted Ivanka Trump just after asking about a time when two Democratic congressmen invited her to speak at an event about her positive experience dealing with the government.\n\n\"You know, I'm glad that the government thinks it's funny for us to try to put on our case,\" Suarez yelled, pointing at attorneys for the state, accusing them of laughing at his questions.\n\n\"I want the record to reflect that the government is sitting here laughing at their attempts to destroy this company.\"\n\nHer two older brothers, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, both sought to blame accountants working for the Trump Organization for inaccuracies in the statements of financial condition, which were central to the alleged scheme to overstate their father's wealth by billions in order to receive favorable rates on loans and insurance.\n\nTrump himself gave different reasons for the inaccuracies while on the stand on Monday. He argued a disclaimer on the statements absolved himself and the company of responsibility for its accuracy. Trump claimed the statements actually under-valued his properties, an assertion that runs counter to a pretrial ruling by the judge, who said the statements over-valued Trump's assets and found the defendants liable for fraud.\n\nJames' office says the Trumps profited by at least $250 million through the fraud, and are asking the judge to award the state an equivalent amount. The judge will also rule on other allegations related to falsification of business records, conspiracy and insurance fraud. The defendants have denied all wrongdoing.\n\nThe state is expected to rest its case after Ivanka Trump concludes her testimony on Thursday.\n\nLawyers for the Trumps will begin calling their own witnesses on Nov. 13. They expect to conclude their case by Dec. 15, they said in court on Monday.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story mischaracterized the letter sent to a bank executive. It was sent by Donald Trump, not Ivanka Trump.\n\nKatrina Kaufman contributed reporting.\n\nGraham Kates is an investigative reporter covering criminal justice, privacy issues and information security for CBS News Digital.

      "text": "Ivanka Trump appears before January 6 committee\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  April 5, 2022 / 4:52 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nWashington - Ivanka Trump, former President Donald Trump's daughter and one of his top White House aides, testified Tuesday before the House committee investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol , appearing virtually before investigators to answer questions for several hours.\n\nCommittee chairman Bennie Thompson of Mississippi told reporters that unlike some witnesses who appeared before the committee, she did not to his knowledge attempt to invoke the Fifth Amendment or executive privilege to avoid giving the committee information.\n\n\"She's answering questions,\" Thompson said. \"Not in a broad, chatty term, but she's answering questions.\"\n\nHer appearance came less than a week after her husband, Jared Kushner, appeared voluntarily before the committee. One of the committee's Democrats, Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia, described his hours-long testimony as \"really valuable\" to help verify and substantiate events under investigation.\n\nThe committee first wrote to Ivanka Trump requesting her appearance in January, and has been negotiating her appearance since then. In the request , Thompson indicated investigators would like to ask Ivanka Trump about a phone conversation her father had with Vice President Mike Pence the morning of January 6 while she was in the Oval Office.\n\nThompson wrote that Keith Kellogg, Pence's national security adviser, was also present for the call, and told the select committee he recalled the former president encouraging Pence to reject states' electoral votes during the joint session of Congress or delay the counting of votes.\n\nKellogg, according to Thompson's letter, testified that Ivanka Trump turned to him at the end of the call and said, \"Mike Pence is a good man.\" Thompson also said the panel obtained testimony indicating White House staff sought Ivanka Trump's assistance several times \"to intervene in an attempt to persuade President Trump to address the ongoing lawlessness and violence\" at the Capitol.\n\nThompson told CBS News on Monday evening that the committee is not currently seeking testimony from the former vice president.\n\n\"There's no effort on the part of the committee to get him to come in,\" he said. \"We know that people broke into here wanting to hang him. We know that his security detail had to protect him in an undisclosed location in the Capitol. So there are a lot of things on that day we know. We know the people who tried to get him to change his mind, about the count and all of that. So what is it we need?\"\n\nIvanka Trump's scheduled appearance also came as the House headed toward a vote on a resolution to hold former Trump aides Dan Scavino and Peter Navarro in contempt of Congress for defying subpoenas to appear before the committee.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who is on the committee, said Tuesday afternoon that the panel \"has a lot of work ahead\" but that members are still \"hopeful\" that they can begin public hearings in May. He added that the committee has \"certainly achieved some big breakthroughs in terms of our investigation.\"\n\nZak Hudak and Scott MacFarlane contributed to this report.\n\nRebecca Kaplan covers Congress for CBS News.\n\n© 2022 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "22 of Ivanka Trump's best and worst looks since her father became president\n\nAlthough she is now most associated with her father's administration, Ivanka Trump was previously known for her eponymous fashion brand.\n\nIvanka shuttered the brand in 2018 after joining her father's administration when he took office in 2017, but she has continued to play with fashion on her own - wearing everything from pantsuits to mini-dresses over the last eight years.\n\nTake a look at some of Ivanka's best and worst looks since Trump first became president.\n\nIvanka arrived at Trump's 2017 inauguration in a white pantsuit from Oscar de la Renta. The suit consisted of slim-fitting pants and a fitted, asymmetrical jacket, which she accessorized with an American flag pin.\n\nThe look was stylish, though Ivanka's choice to wear a suit was a bit surprising.\n\nHilary Clinton, Trump's opponent in the 2016 presidential race, is well-known for wearing pantsuits . Clinton's suit for the inauguration was also white, making it difficult not to compare Ivanka and Clinton's looks.\n\nIvanka and her sister, Tiffany Trump , also had a matching moment at the 2017 inauguration.\n\nIvanka changed into a ball gown by Carolina Herrera for the 2017 inaugural balls.\n\nThe champagne-toned gown featured a v-neckline, and the bodice, top of the skirt, and semi-sheer sleeves were all covered in sparkly embellishments.\n\nCelebratory and elegant, the dress was a good fit for the occasion.\n\nIvanka attended the joint session of Congress in a form-fitting berry pink Roland Mouret dress. The dress hit her at the knee and featured a diagonal peplum across the waist.\n\nThe dress also had an asymmetrical neckline with a black spaghetti strap on one shoulder. The strap looked more like a bra peeking out from the garment than a part of the dress, making the whole look feel too casual for the event.\n\nIvanka's close-toed heels also looked clunky with the slim-fitted dress.\n\nIvanka's pink dress for the 2017 G20 summit cinched at her waist, and the skirt flared to her knees.\n\nThe long sleeves were form-fitting until they hit her elbow, where they flared out. A bow also sat on each sleeve.\n\nThe combination of the flared fabric and bows made the sleeves look too heavy, detracting from the chic aspects of the rest of the dress.\n\nThe look would have been stronger with more streamlined sleeves.\n\nIvanka attended the 2018 Curling Men's Gold Medal Game in South Korea in a red and navy Aquazzura dress.\n\nThe sweater dress had long sleeves and a high neckline, and the stripes appeared to wrap around her figure diagonally. She paired the dress with knee-high, laced boots.\n\nAlthough the dress was on theme for the event, the stripes were a bit overwhelming to the eye. The look would have been stronger if the stripes didn't crisscross.\n\nWhen she watched the bobsleigh competition, Ivanka fit right in with Team USA. She paired red pants with a white, red, and blue sweater and accessorized the look with a coordinating coat and a Team USA hat.\n\nIvanka wore a flared jumpsuit to the Generation Next Summit in March 2018.\n\nIt had a v-neckline and belted at the waist, creating a summery look. However, Ivanka wore a black turtleneck under it, which had a different tone and looked out of place with the jumpsuit.\n\nShe could have paired the jumpsuit with a blazer or cropped jacket instead.\n\nIvanka wore an elegant Oscar de la Renta dress to the White House in April 2018 to welcome French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThe midi-length dress had quarter-length sleeves and hugged Ivanka's figure. Its asymmetrical neckline was adorned with white fabric that formed a knot on one side.\n\nThe dress was simple and chic.\n\nAlexis Nalani designed the midi-length dress, which was white and covered in a layer of black lace.\n\nThe bodice had a high neckline, and the sleeves and skirt were made of tiers of ruffles. The lace and ruffles were too much together, and Ivanka's embellished shoes didn't help tone the look down.\n\nThe silhouette and fabric could have been pretty on different dresses, but together, they were distracting.\n\nWalking across the White House lawn, Ivanka wore a red, fitted blazer with coordinating, cropped pants. She wore red pumps with the bright look.\n\nBold and well-tailored, the suit was a win for Ivanka.\n\nIvanka wore a white top and matching skirt made of textured fabric for a White House briefing in October 2018. The top featured a subtle peplum and coordinating flared sleeves.\n\nIvanka added a wide, taupe belt to her waist, which matched her pointed-toe shoes.\n\nThe belt was a misstep for the look, as it looked outdated with the more traditional silhouette. She could have skipped the belt or opted for a thinner version.\n\nVisiting Google's offices in October 2019, Ivanka wore ankle-length green trousers with a coordinating blazer.\n\nShe wore a black top underneath the jacket, which matched her pointed-toe black shoes. The look was stylish and professional.\n\nJoining her father for the January 2020 \"White House Summit on Human Trafficking,\" Ivanka wore a white wrap dress made of a thick fabric.\n\nThe bottom of her sleeves flared, as did the skirt, and the dress cinched at the waist with a thick bow. The choice of fabric and wrap style made the dress look more like a bathrobe than a dress.\n\nA sleeker silhouette or fabric would have made the dress more stylish.\n\nWhen her father was on the campaign trail, Lela Rose designed the sundress Ivanka wore in North Carolina in August 2020.\n\nThe midi dress had a high neckline and a form-fitting bodice covered in blue floral embroidery that spilled onto the flared skirt.\n\nShe accessorized the look with white open-toed heels and an off-white purse, completing the summery and feminine ensemble.\n\nIvanka was photographed at the White House with her husband in a turtleneck, brown boots, and a tan, double-breasted coat. She completed the look with sunglasses.\n\nThe relaxed outfit was a nice change of pace for Ivanka, and it complemented the fall weather perfectly.\n\nAfter laying low since her father left office in 2021, Ivanka appeared in an off-white, sparkly set from Lapointe at Kim Kardashian's birthday party in October 2023 .\n\nThe long-sleeve, cropped top was slightly loose, while the high-waisted skirt was form-fitting until a thigh-high slit cup up her leg.\n\nNude open-toed Christian Louboutin heels with curved detailing completed the festive look.\n\nIvanka attended the grand opening of Fontainebleau Las Vegas in a Monique Lhuillier gown.\n\nThe strapless dress's bodice was black, while the form-fitting skirt was covered in reflective silver fabric.\n\nIt was pretty, but the dress would have been stronger if it was completely sparkly, especially for an event in Las Vegas.\n\nSelf-Portrait designed the tennis-inspired yellow dress Ivanka wore to the Miami Open in March 2024.\n\nThe dress featured ribbed fabric, ruffled long sleeves, a flared collar, and buttons down the front. If that wasn't enough, the two sets of pockets on her waist and chest were distracting from the figure-hugging silhouette, particularly when combined with everything else the dress had going on.\n\nWithout the pockets, the dress would have been a great choice for the event.\n\nThe garment's square neckline gave way to an exposed corset adorned with subtle, sparkly embroidery.\n\nA swath of fabric cut across the short skirt, adding dimension to the look. She paired the dress with open-toed heels and a clutch, completing the sexy look.\n\nIvanka stepped away from her more daring looks when it came time for her father to return to the White House.\n\nAhead of the 2025 inauguration, Ivanka wore an Oscar de la Renta coat with a matching dress. The bottom half of the camel-colored coat was embellished with three-dimensional floral appliques, which added a stylish touch to the monochromatic look.\n\nIvanka arrived at the 2025 inauguration in a complete hunter-green outfit, a refreshing color for the ceremony that usually sees people wearing shades of red, white, or blue.\n\nDior designed her asymmetrical blazer, pencil skirt, and coordinating beret. She wore a thin belt around her waist, which matched her black tights and pointed-toe heels.\n\nThe ensemble put a high-fashion twist on familiar skirt sets that are common for the DC set.\n\nIvanka attended the 2025 inaugural balls in a custom Givenchy gown, a recreation of the dress Hubert de Givenchy designed for Audrey Hepburn to wear in \"Sabrina,\" a rom-com released in 1954.\n\nThe strapless dress, cinched at the waist, had a slim-fitted skirt that hit Ivanka above her ankles. A detached train flowed out behind her, forming a train. Black floral embellishments sat on the bodice, skirt, and train, and Ivanka nodded to them with matching black gloves and shoes.\n\nShe also wore over $1.1 million in diamond jewelry throughout the inauguration.\n\nNodding to a Hollywood icon at the inaugural balls didn't make sense from a historical fashion perspective. Plus, Ivanka's choice to wear black gloves instead of white, as Hepburn did, lessened the effect of the recreation as well. She should have saved the look for another occasion.\n\nJump to"

He's used it as is primary fundraising vehicle, often sending out messages making false claims about the 2020 election and his legal problems to convince donors to give it money.\n\nMuch of the PAC's expenses go to legal fees, with Trump battling criminal indictments and civil lawsuits over his attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, claims of sexual misconduct and defamation , and allegations of financial misconduct through his company, as well as suing media organizations for what he claims is unfair coverage.\n\nRobert Maguire, the research director for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a campaign-finance watchdog organization, said Trump had deceived Save America's donors for years.\n\n\"In 2020, he raised tens of millions of dollars for the PAC by making baseless claims of a stolen election and casting the PAC as an 'Official Election Defense Fund,'\" Maguire told Business Insider. \"Since then, the committee has largely become a vehicle for paying his, his family's, and his associates' legal bills while also channeling tens of millions to a pro-Trump super PAC.\"\n\nIn 2023, Save America disbursed a total of $1,303,667.11 to the law firm Troutman Pepper Hamilton Sanders and $1,042,479 to the firm Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel, & Frederick.\n\nBoth firms represented Ivanka Trump in New York Attorney General Letitia James' sprawling lawsuit against the Trump Organization , Donald Trump, his three eldest children, and several executives over its finances. The attorney general's office alleged that the firm misrepresented its finances to obtain favorable tax, bank-loan, and insurance rates.\n\nThe law firms appear to have done a good job. In June of last year, a New York state appeals court dismissed Ivanka Trump as a defendant in the suit, ruling that the claims involving her were beyond the statute of limitations for the allegations.\n\nBeginning in September 2022, Ivanka was represented by Michael K. Kellogg of the Washington, DC, Kellogg Hansen firm, court records show , with his colleague Reid M. Figel joining in January 2023. Clifford S. Robert and Michael Farina of Robert & Robert served as their local counsel while also defending Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. in the litigation.\n\nIn court filings, Figel argued Ivanka ought to be treated differently from her siblings and father because she stopped working at the Trump Organization in 2017.\n\n\"Ms. Trump's factual and legal defenses are unique, both because the legal theory and factual allegations made against her are different, and because she left the company in January, 2017,\" Farina wrote in a March 2023 filing .\n\nKellogg and Figel withdrew from representing Ivanka Trump the following month as the case moved closer to trial.\n\nShortly afterward, the Troutman Pepper attorney Bennet J. Moskowitz, who previously represented Jeffrey Epstein's estate executors in litigation from rape accusers, joined the court docket as a lawyer representing Ivanka Trump.\n\nHis colleague Ketan D. Bhirud joined Ivanka Trump's team in June, the same month she was removed as a defendant in the lawsuit.\n\nEven though Ivanka would no longer be a defendant, the New York attorney general's office wasn't done with her.\n\nThe office still wanted her to appear in the case as a witness and even cited her lawyers \"being paid by Mr. Trump's Save America PAC along with the other Defendants\" as a reason she should be forced to testify, according to emails later included in a court exhibit.\n\n\"Hope you are doing well and I am sure you are excited to hear from us again,\" a member of the office wrote to Moskowitz in a September email. \"We wanted to let you know that we are including Ivanka on the preliminary trial witness list we are sending over to Defendants this evening.\"\n\nIn October, after the trial began, Moskowitz tried to quash the trial subpoena , arguing it was beyond the court's jurisdiction and wasn't served properly. He also argued that, as a Florida resident with three kids in school, it would be too cumbersome for her to be in New York for testimony.\n\n\"Ms. Trump, who resides in Florida with her three minor children, will suffer undue hardship if a stay is denied and she is required to testify at trial in New York in the middle of a school week,\" Moskowitz wrote in a filing.\n\nThe arguments didn't work. Ivanka Trump testified in the trial on November 8.\n\nShe appeared to have a hazy memory, often answering with \" I don't recall \" or \"I don't remember\" to questions about loans she may have worked on .\n\nThe trial officially concluded with closing arguments in January, with a decision from New York Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron expected later this month.\n\nWhen Moskowitz - a New York attorney - stepped into the case in April, Robert stopped representing Ivanka Trump but continued to represent her two brothers.\n\nNeither Kellogg, Farina, Moskowitz, nor Bhirud responded to a request for comment from BI. BI could not identify any Trump-linked cases they worked on other than representing Ivanka Trump in the New York attorney general's lawsuit.\n\nRobert's firm, however, has been more deeply involved in Trump's personal legal problems.\n\nHe also represented Trump in a now-dismissed lawsuit over the Trump Organization's involvement in a multi-level marketing company and a case from Michael Cohen over unpaid legal bills, which was settled in mid-2023.\n\nRobert & Robert received a total of $5,288,756.36 from Save America - more than any other law firm or individual attorney, according to a Business Insider review of the FEC records.\n\nClifford S. Robert didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe legal costs for law firms representing Ivanka Trump are just a sliver of the more than $50 million that Save America and the MAGA PAC, another political group controlled by her father, spent on legal costs. Representatives for the PACs didn't respond to Business requests for comment from BI.\n\nIt's not clear why Trump's political donors would have paid for Ivanka Trump's representations in the case. Ethics filings indicate that she and her husband, Jared Kushner, had a net worth of about $1 billion during the Trump presidency, and a financial firm founded by Kushner has raised billions of dollars more after Trump left office. Ivanka Trump didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nMaguire, the CREW research director, said the FEC's Republican commissioners had refused to take action against alleged PAC spending violations.\n\n\"The FEC's Republican commissioners have voted against every single instance where the agency's own nonpartisan lawyers have found reason to believe Trump or his committees committed violations,\" he said.\n\nCorrection: February 7, 2024 - An earlier version of this story misspelled the name of the Troutman Pepper attorney who represented Ivanka Trump.

      "text": "Trump paid his daughter Ivanka $747,622 for 'consulting,' then deducted it from his taxes, according to a New York Times investigation\n\nPresident Donald Trump once appeared to pay his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, $747,622 in \"consulting fees,\" then write them off on his taxes, a New York Times investigation found .\n\nThat figure was among about $26 million in \"unexplained 'consulting fees'\" that the president wrote off from 2010 to 2018, The Times reported on Sunday.\n\nThe investigation , detailing two decades of Trump's tax returns, found that he was a far less successful entrepreneur than the image he has tried to sell the American public.\n\nThe Times found that Trump paid only $750 in federal income taxes the year he won the presidency and the same amount his first year in office.\n\nIn 10 of the previous 15 years, he paid no income taxes, The Times reported.\n\nThe tax filings The Times reviewed don't name the consultants. But reporters matched the $747,622 figure claimed by the Trump Organization to the number Ivanka Trump reported in a financial disclosure when she joined the White House in 2017.\n\nThe Trump Organization claimed that the payments were related to hotel projects in Vancouver and Hawaii, The Times reported. Ivanka Trump \"had been an executive officer of the Trump companies that received profits from and paid the consulting fees for both projects,\" meaning she appeared to be treated as a consultant on the same hotel deals she was already responsible for managing, the newspaper said.\n\nTax law allows employers to deduct consulting fees as a business expense, but IRS rules specify that to do so, the consulting arrangement must be an \"ordinary and necessary\" part of operating the business.\n\nThe Times noted that the IRS has pursued civil penalties against some business owners who sought to avoid taxes by paying high fees to related parties who were not really independent contractors. The newspaper cited a 2011 case in which the IRS denied an Illinois accounting firm $3 million in consulting-fee deductions because it learned that the partners paid themselves the fees through corporations they created.\n\nA Trump Organization lawyer did not comment to The Times on the consulting-fee arrangement.\n\nThe lawyer also told The Times that \"most, if not all, of the facts\" in its investigative report \"appear to be inaccurate.\"\n\nIt is not totally uncommon for companies to hire related parties to do consulting work, Michael Dambra, an associate professor of accounting and law at the University at Buffalo School of Management, told Insider.\n\n\"I would say for family companies it's a typical tax-avoidance strategy,\" Dambra said. \"I wouldn't say there is anything unusual. What the Trump Organization would have to prove is that these consulting fees served a valid business purpose and that the prices were reasonable.\"\n\nDambra's biography page says that his research \"examines the economic impact of regulatory changes\" and that his findings have been cited in Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, SEC commissioner speeches, congressional depositions, and policy papers from the US Treasury Department.\n\nIf the Trump Organization were a publicly traded company, there would be mandatory disclosures related to business done by related parties - but since it's a private company, there is information related to the dealings that's not available, Dambra said.\n\nDambra said that if the IRS were to challenge the deductions - \"and we know that there are audits going on,\" he said - the agency would want evidence that the consulting work was actually done and that it was necessary.\n\nDambra said he thought it was \"a little unusual\" for an executive of a company to be paid consultant fees.\n\n\"It's possible that Ivanka Trump has a fantastic consulting business and so they were the best company for the job,\" he said, \"but it would be pointed out as unusual and something the IRS would certainly investigate.\"\n\nAs for The Times' investigation as a whole, Dambra said he always finds it interesting the disconnect between what Trump claims his net worth is and \"what shows up in the numbers.\"\n\nDambra pointed to a 2019 Buffalo News report that said Trump inflated his net worth by $4 billion when he bid to buy the Buffalo Bills football team years earlier.\n\nUltimately, he said, in order to know whether the consultant-fee deductions related to the payments to Ivanka Trump were valid, more needs to be disclosed.\n\n\"I would say in defense to Trump here, there's nothing unreasonable about trying to minimize your taxes. We all do some form of that,\" he said. \"The question at hand is whether this is defensible, and that's what we don't have information on.\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Trump paid his daughter Ivanka $747,622 for 'consulting,' then deducted it from his taxes, according to a New York Times investigation\n\nPresident Donald Trump once appeared to pay his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, $747,622 in \"consulting fees,\" then write them off on his taxes, a New York Times investigation found .\n\nThat figure was among about $26 million in \"unexplained 'consulting fees'\" that the president wrote off from 2010 to 2018, The Times reported on Sunday.\n\nThe investigation , detailing two decades of Trump's tax returns, found that he was a far less successful entrepreneur than the image he has tried to sell the American public.\n\nThe Times found that Trump paid only $750 in federal income taxes the year he won the presidency and the same amount his first year in office.\n\nIn 10 of the previous 15 years, he paid no income taxes, The Times reported.\n\nThe tax filings The Times reviewed don't name the consultants. But reporters matched the $747,622 figure claimed by the Trump Organization to the number Ivanka Trump reported in a financial disclosure when she joined the White House in 2017.\n\nThe Trump Organization claimed that the payments were related to hotel projects in Vancouver and Hawaii, The Times reported. Ivanka Trump \"had been an executive officer of the Trump companies that received profits from and paid the consulting fees for both projects,\" meaning she appeared to be treated as a consultant on the same hotel deals she was already responsible for managing, the newspaper said.\n\nTax law allows employers to deduct consulting fees as a business expense, but IRS rules specify that to do so, the consulting arrangement must be an \"ordinary and necessary\" part of operating the business.\n\nThe Times noted that the IRS has pursued civil penalties against some business owners who sought to avoid taxes by paying high fees to related parties who were not really independent contractors. The newspaper cited a 2011 case in which the IRS denied an Illinois accounting firm $3 million in consulting-fee deductions because it learned that the partners paid themselves the fees through corporations they created.\n\nA Trump Organization lawyer did not comment to The Times on the consulting-fee arrangement.\n\nThe lawyer also told The Times that \"most, if not all, of the facts\" in its investigative report \"appear to be inaccurate.\"\n\nIt is not totally uncommon for companies to hire related parties to do consulting work, Michael Dambra, an associate professor of accounting and law at the University at Buffalo School of Management, told Insider.\n\n\"I would say for family companies it's a typical tax-avoidance strategy,\" Dambra said. \"I wouldn't say there is anything unusual. What the Trump Organization would have to prove is that these consulting fees served a valid business purpose and that the prices were reasonable.\"\n\nDambra's biography page says that his research \"examines the economic impact of regulatory changes\" and that his findings have been cited in Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, SEC commissioner speeches, congressional depositions, and policy papers from the US Treasury Department.\n\nIf the Trump Organization were a publicly traded company, there would be mandatory disclosures related to business done by related parties - but since it's a private company, there is information related to the dealings that's not available, Dambra said.\n\nDambra said that if the IRS were to challenge the deductions - \"and we know that there are audits going on,\" he said - the agency would want evidence that the consulting work was actually done and that it was necessary.\n\nDambra said he thought it was \"a little unusual\" for an executive of a company to be paid consultant fees.\n\n\"It's possible that Ivanka Trump has a fantastic consulting business and so they were the best company for the job,\" he said, \"but it would be pointed out as unusual and something the IRS would certainly investigate.\"\n\nAs for The Times' investigation as a whole, Dambra said he always finds it interesting the disconnect between what Trump claims his net worth is and \"what shows up in the numbers.\"\n\nDambra pointed to a 2019 Buffalo News report that said Trump inflated his net worth by $4 billion when he bid to buy the Buffalo Bills football team years earlier.\n\nUltimately, he said, in order to know whether the consultant-fee deductions related to the payments to Ivanka Trump were valid, more needs to be disclosed.\n\n\"I would say in defense to Trump here, there's nothing unreasonable about trying to minimize your taxes. We all do some form of that,\" he said. \"The question at hand is whether this is defensible, and that's what we don't have information on.\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "9 surprising facts about Ivanka Trump\n\nIvana Marie Trump was born on October 30, 1981. \"Ivanka\" is actually a nickname for the name Ivana and is typically used solely in a person's youth. As she explained on Twitter in 2010 , it's similar to how the name Robert may be changed to Bobby when the person is younger.\n\nTrump transferred to Choate Rosemary Hall, an elite boarding school in Connecticut, after her parents decided she wasn't focused enough on school amid her high-society life and modeling opportunities in New York City.\n\n\"I was all of a sudden in the prison of boarding school life, and all my friends in New York were having fun,\" she said in a 2007 interview, according to the Express .\n\nHowever, Trump was able to leave the boarding school campus to pursue her modeling career while still a teenager. She ended up modeling for major fashion designers like Versace and Thierry Mugler.\n\nTrump signed with Elite Model Management and even appeared on the cover of Seventeen in 1997 when she was in high school.\n\nAt Choate, she was allowed to have a car on campus so she could get to her modeling gigs, which was a luxury no other student had, Refinery29 reported. She also had a cell phone so she could call her famous dad - while teenagers did have cell phones in the late '90s, they weren't nearly as commonplace as they are now.\n\nAfter making her way up the corporate ladder at the Trump Organization, Ivanka Trump joined her father, Donald Trump, on his reality show \"The Apprentice\" for a handful of episodes in 2006. She joined the show as a full-time boardroom judge the following season, which began airing in 2007.\n\nShe then starred alongside Trump on \"The Celebrity Apprentice,\" appearing as a co-judge from 2008 until 2015 when Trump announced he would be running for president.\n\nIvanka Trump met Kushner, an Orthodox Jew, at a networking lunch arranged by one of her business partners. Trump and Kushner were both 25 years old at the time.\n\n\"They very innocently set us up thinking that our only interest in one another would be transactional,\" Ivanka told Vogue in 2015 . \"Whenever we see them we're like, 'The best deal we ever made!'\"\n\nHowever, the couple split in 2008 because of their religious differences - Trump's family is Presbyterian. They got back together a few months later. By 2009, Trump had converted to Orthodox Judaism and she and Kushner were engaged.\n\nTrump described her diet to Vogue in 2015, saying she stays away from raw fish and meat.\n\n\"I always shied away from it being a public conversation because it's such a personal thing,\" she said of her conversion to Judaism. \"We're pretty observant, more than some, less than others. I just feel like it's such an intimate thing for us.\"\n\n\"It's been such a great life decision for me,\" she continued. \"I am very modern, but I'm also a very traditional person, and I think that's an interesting juxtaposition in how I was raised as well. I really find that with Judaism, it creates an amazing blueprint for family connectivity.\"\n\nShe also said that their family observes the Sabbath.\n\n\"From Friday to Saturday we don't do anything but hang out with one another,\" she said. \"We don't make phone calls.\"\n\nShe and Kushner have three children together: daughter Arabella Rose (born July 2011) and sons Joseph Frederick (born October 2013) and Theodore James Kushner (born March 2016).\n\nSpeaking to People in 2016 , she said she squeezes in getting ready before her children wake up.\n\n\"I want my children to see me first every morning, so I wake up at 5 and make sure to shower and exercise before they get up,\" she said.\n\nShe added that she tries to spend time with each of her children doing the things that they love.\n\n\"I try to carve out special time with each of them,\" she said. \"Joseph loves playing with cars. Arabella could read with me for hours. I never loved baking until Arabella started cooking with me.\" She added, \"Poor Theo, he's always the one where they're interrupting his time with me.\"\n\nHer first book, \" The Trump Card: Playing to Win in Work and Life, \" was on The New York Times Best Seller list following its release in 2009.\n\nIn 2017, Trump released another book, \" Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success .\" Though it didn't land on the bestseller list, it did receive almost a five-star rating on Amazon.\n\nTrump endorsed Hillary Clinton for the Democratic primary over Barack Obama in 2007 and was a close friend of Chelsea Clinton.\n\n\"There's nothing skin-deep about Ivanka,\" Chelsea Clinton told Vogue in 2015. \"And I think that's a real tribute to her because certainly anyone as gorgeous as she is could have probably gone quite far being skin-deep.\"\n\nHowever, the pair's relationship appears to have become strained after the bitter race between their parents in the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\"I've not spoken to her since 2016,\" Chelsea Clinton told the \"Today\" show in 2020. \"I have no interest in being friends with someone who is not only complicit, but actively taking part in this administration's everyday collision of cruelty and incompetence. So, that's the answer.\"\n\nIn 2012, Ivanka Trump endorsed Mitt Romney for president. He would later become one of President Trump's biggest critics in the Senate and voted to impeach him twice.\n\nTrump positioned herself firmly on the right when she endorsed her father for president in 2016. She also changed her official voter registration from Democrat to Republican in 2018. She said in April 2016 that she was an independent .\n\n\"Like many of my fellow millennials, I do not consider myself categorically Republican or Democrat. ... Sometimes it's a tough choice,\" she said at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio. \"That is not the case this time. This is the moment and Donald Trump is the person to make America great again.\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Ivanka Trump testifies about Trump Organization fraud\n\nBy\n\nAndrea Bernstein\n\nIvanka Trump, daughter of former President Donald Trump, was on the witness stand today to answer questions about fraudulent financial documents filed by the Trump Organization.\n\nSCOTT DETROW, HOST: New York has rested its $250 million civil fraud case against Donald Trump. Over six weeks of testimony, the state attorney general's office has presented evidence of a conspiracy by the former president and his company to lie about the value of their assets. The state's final witness was a key person in Trump's business and political orbit, his daughter Ivanka. NPR's Andrea Bernstein has been in the courtroom following it all and joins us now. Hey, Andrea. ANDREA BERNSTEIN, BYLINE: Hey, Scott. DETROW: So the AG's finished with its main case. What's the general outline of their evidence? BERNSTEIN: So the case, as we all know, ended with the well-observed testimony of Donald Trump and his three older children. But mostly, we've heard from Trump employees, appraisers, accountants and bankers. And bit by bit, the evidence has accrued. Donald Trump cared deeply about his statements of net worth, and his employees undertook to massage the numbers so they turned out the way he wanted. DETROW: So let's talk about Ivanka Trump. She is not a defendant, so today she testified as a witness. How would you describe her testimony? BERNSTEIN: So unlike her father, Ivanka Trump is disciplined. She didn't go off on political diatribes and was careful to say she always tried to be accurate. Unlike her brothers, she seemed on top of the deals she was involved in, that is until she went to the White House in 2017. But like her brothers and her father, when presented with emails and documents with her name on them, her most repeated refrain was I don't recall or I don't specifically remember. DETROW: What do we know about what was in those key emails and documents? BERNSTEIN: So this is where things got interesting. The AG showed emails from Ivanka Trump to various bankers, trying to get loans for projects in Chicago, Florida and Washington, D.C. And when she went to the regular commercial real estate divisions of banks, she was told the banks didn't really want to lend for resorts and hotels in the wake of the financial crisis. That translated to high interest rates, like 9%. So Ivanka's husband, Jared Kushner, she testified, introduced her to the private wealth division of Deutsche Bank, and she was able to get rates way lower, in the 2% range. But there was a catch. Donald Trump had to guarantee the loans and certify them year over year with his statements of financial condition. DETROW: And this is a key clarification here in this case - these are the statements that the judge has already found to be false? BERNSTEIN: Correct. And what's important is that if the AG shows what the Trumps saved by basing their loans on false statements, the judge can order Donald Trump to pay it all back to the state - potentially hundreds of millions of dollars. One interesting side note that came out today - Ivanka Trump was still trying to get a very favorable loan for $50 million in 2016, when her father was running for president. The amount she sought was very close to the amount of money Donald Trump was putting into his campaign. DETROW: So Trump's lawyers cross-examined Ivanka Trump. What did she say during their questioning? BERNSTEIN: They asked her about her work on Doral and the Old Post Office, and Ivanka was able to slip in at least twice that the Doral deal was offered to her as she was giving birth to her oldest child, Arabella, and that the property had sentimental affection for her father. She said he had gone there with his father, Fred Trump, and later with her mother, Ivana Trump. Ivanka Trump said the Deutsche bankers were very happy with their loan on Doral and that the Old Post Office - they thought the Old Post Office was the crown jewel of their investment portfolio. Even though under New York law you're not allowed to lie as part of your business model even if no one was harmed, this is exactly what we expect to hear more of from the defense case, which starts Monday and will go into mid-December.

But mostly, we've heard from Trump employees, appraisers, accountants and bankers. And bit by bit, the evidence has accrued. Donald Trump cared deeply about his statements of net worth, and his employees undertook to massage the numbers so they turned out the way he wanted. DETROW: So let's talk about Ivanka Trump. She is not a defendant, so today she testified as a witness. How would you describe her testimony? BERNSTEIN: So unlike her father, Ivanka Trump is disciplined. She didn't go off on political diatribes and was careful to say she always tried to be accurate. Unlike her brothers, she seemed on top of the deals she was involved in, that is until she went to the White House in 2017. But like her brothers and her father, when presented with emails and documents with her name on them, her most repeated refrain was I don't recall or I don't specifically remember. DETROW: What do we know about what was in those key emails and documents? BERNSTEIN: So this is where things got interesting. The AG showed emails from Ivanka Trump to various bankers, trying to get loans for projects in Chicago, Florida and Washington, D.C. And when she went to the regular commercial real estate divisions of banks, she was told the banks didn't really want to lend for resorts and hotels in the wake of the financial crisis. That translated to high interest rates, like 9%. So Ivanka's husband, Jared Kushner, she testified, introduced her to the private wealth division of Deutsche Bank, and she was able to get rates way lower, in the 2% range. But there was a catch. Donald Trump had to guarantee the loans and certify them year over year with his statements of financial condition. DETROW: And this is a key clarification here in this case - these are the statements that the judge has already found to be false? BERNSTEIN: Correct. And what's important is that if the AG shows what the Trumps saved by basing their loans on false statements, the judge can order Donald Trump to pay it all back to the state - potentially hundreds of millions of dollars. One interesting side note that came out today - Ivanka Trump was still trying to get a very favorable loan for $50 million in 2016, when her father was running for president. The amount she sought was very close to the amount of money Donald Trump was putting into his campaign. DETROW: So Trump's lawyers cross-examined Ivanka Trump. What did she say during their questioning? BERNSTEIN: They asked her about her work on Doral and the Old Post Office, and Ivanka was able to slip in at least twice that the Doral deal was offered to her as she was giving birth to her oldest child, Arabella, and that the property had sentimental affection for her father. She said he had gone there with his father, Fred Trump, and later with her mother, Ivana Trump. Ivanka Trump said the Deutsche bankers were very happy with their loan on Doral and that the Old Post Office - they thought the Old Post Office was the crown jewel of their investment portfolio. Even though under New York law you're not allowed to lie as part of your business model even if no one was harmed, this is exactly what we expect to hear more of from the defense case, which starts Monday and will go into mid-December.

She didn't go off on political diatribes and was careful to say she always tried to be accurate. Unlike her brothers, she seemed on top of the deals she was involved in, that is until she went to the White House in 2017. But like her brothers and her father, when presented with emails and documents with her name on them, her most repeated refrain was I don't recall or I don't specifically remember. DETROW: What do we know about what was in those key emails and documents? BERNSTEIN: So this is where things got interesting. The AG showed emails from Ivanka Trump to various bankers, trying to get loans for projects in Chicago, Florida and Washington, D.C. And when she went to the regular commercial real estate divisions of banks, she was told the banks didn't really want to lend for resorts and hotels in the wake of the financial crisis. That translated to high interest rates, like 9%. So Ivanka's husband, Jared Kushner, she testified, introduced her to the private wealth division of Deutsche Bank, and she was able to get rates way lower, in the 2% range. But there was a catch. Donald Trump had to guarantee the loans and certify them year over year with his statements of financial condition. DETROW: And this is a key clarification here in this case - these are the statements that the judge has already found to be false? BERNSTEIN: Correct. And what's important is that if the AG shows what the Trumps saved by basing their loans on false statements, the judge can order Donald Trump to pay it all back to the state - potentially hundreds of millions of dollars. One interesting side note that came out today - Ivanka Trump was still trying to get a very favorable loan for $50 million in 2016, when her father was running for president. The amount she sought was very close to the amount of money Donald Trump was putting into his campaign. DETROW: So Trump's lawyers cross-examined Ivanka Trump. What did she say during their questioning? BERNSTEIN: They asked her about her work on Doral and the Old Post Office, and Ivanka was able to slip in at least twice that the Doral deal was offered to her as she was giving birth to her oldest child, Arabella, and that the property had sentimental affection for her father. She said he had gone there with his father, Fred Trump, and later with her mother, Ivana Trump. Ivanka Trump said the Deutsche bankers were very happy with their loan on Doral and that the Old Post Office - they thought the Old Post Office was the crown jewel of their investment portfolio. Even though under New York law you're not allowed to lie as part of your business model even if no one was harmed, this is exactly what we expect to hear more of from the defense case, which starts Monday and will go into mid-December. DETROW: That is NPR's Andrea Bernstein joining us from the streets of New York City. Thank you so much, Andrea. BERNSTEIN: Thank you, Scott. Copyright © 2023 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Drew Angerer/Getty Images hide caption\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and daughter Ivanka Trump walk to Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House on Jan. 4, 2020.\n\nThe Democratic-led House select committee looking into the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol is seeking Ivanka Trump's voluntary cooperation with its investigation.\n\nCommittee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., issued a letter Thursday to the former first daughter and senior adviser to then-President Donald Trump.\n\nThe letter also detailed new evidence the panel has uncovered about her role the day of the siege, including multiple attempts to get her father to intervene in the attack and his efforts to undo President Biden's election.\n\n\"We respect your privacy, and our questions will be limited to issues relating to January 6th, the activities that contributed to or influenced events on January 6th, and your role in the White House during that period,\" Thompson wrote.\n\nThe committee has proposed a meeting date of Feb. 3 or 4, or during the week of Feb. 7. Ivanka Trump could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nThe request comes a day after NPR confirmed the committee had requested phone records from family member Eric Trump and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr.\n\nIt's also a strong indication that the committee is moving its investigation into the former president's inner circle.\n\nThis is the first voluntary ask of a Trump family member. The committee has asked sitting Republican lawmakers to cooperate, but those asks have been rebuffed.\n\nThompson had hinted earlier this month that Ivanka Trump was someone the panel would want to talk to.\n\nIn the letter to Ivanka Trump, the panel said its members want her to weigh in on details obtained through other witnesses. For example, they shared testimony from retired Army Gen. Keith Kellogg, the former national security adviser to then-Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nBoth Kellogg and Ivanka Trump were in the room when her father talked to Pence by phone the morning of Jan. 6, the panel said. Trump told Pence, \"You don't have the courage to make a hard decision,\" Kellogg confirmed.\n\nKellogg also confirmed to the panel Trump made other remarks to Pence, along the lines of, \"Mike, it's not right. You can do this. I'm counting on you to do it. If you don't do it, I picked the wrong man four years ago. You're going to wimp out.\"\n\nThe remarks came as Pence was being pressured by Trump to overturn the election's results - despite his ceremonial role to certify Biden's win at the Capitol later that day.\n\nKellogg also told the panel that at the end of the call, Ivanka turned to him and said, \"Mike Pence is a good man.\"\n\nThe committee also notes they have documents showing that the Trump White House counsel may have concluded that, had Pence followed through with the former president's plans, it would have violated the Constitution or would be illegal.\n\nThe panel, though the letter, also shared that an unidentified member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus warned the White House if Trump followed through with his plans on Jan. 6, it would \"drive a stake in the heart of the federal republic.\"\n\nThe committee has outlined four areas of interest they want to learn more about from Ivanka Trump. The first: learning more about her father's attempts to impede the electoral count in Congress.\n\n\"[T]he Select Committee would like to discuss any other conversations you may have witnessed or participated in regarding the President's plan to obstruct or impede the counting of electoral votes,\" Thompson wrote.\n\nThe committee also wants to learn more about the former president's response to the attack on the Capitol. The committee has reports from several people they've already interviewed indicating White House staff \"requested your assistance on multiple occasions\" to get then-President Trump to address what was happening.\n\nMembers of the staff, the panel said, viewed Ivanka Trump as perhaps the only person who could get her \"stubborn\" father to act against the attack. Ivanka Trump made multiple attempts to get her father to stop the attack, but he did release a video asking rioters to leave the Capitol until 4:17 p.m. EST that day - about two hours since she urged action, the panel said.\n\n\"You have knowledge bearing directly on the President's actions or inaction on January 6th, and his state of mind as the violent attack occurred at the Capitol,\" Thompson wrote.\n\nRelated to this, the committee wants to learn what role former President Trump played in the order to deploy the National Guard to the Capitol and has asked Ivanka Trump to share any information she may have on this topic.\n\nThe committee is also looking into what the former president did in the days after the Jan. 6 attack - in particular, any attempts by staff to stop Trump from talking about a stolen election.\n\nFor example, the letter points to more texts sent by Fox News personality Sean Hannity to White House officials - after revealing recently his exchanges with former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.\n\nIn new details, the panel said Hannity sent a text to then-White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany detailing a five-point approach to conversations with the former president that included \"no more stolen election talk.\"\n\nHannity also warned McEnany that talk of Trump's impeachment and removal from office \"are real\" and \"many people will quit.\"\n\nMcEnany texted Hannity back, \"Love that. Thank you. That is the playbook. I will reinforce,\" in a partial snapshot of her response.\n\nMcEnany also agreed with another Hannity text that \"no more crazy people\" should be near Trump.\n\n\"The Select Committee would like to discuss this effort after January 6th to persuade President Trump not to associate himself with certain people, and to avoid further discussion regarding election fraud allegations,\" Thompson wrote.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Former President Donald Trump and others, including Ivanka's brothers Eric and Donald Jr., are accused of taking part in a wide-ranging conspiracy to commit business fraud. The stakes are high. The state's attorney general wants them banned from doing business in New York, along with a $250 million in penalties. Ivanka Trump's testimony could be key. NPR's Andrea Bernstein has been following the trial throughout, and she's with us once again for a preview. Good morning. ANDREA BERNSTEIN, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: OK, so help us understand - Ivanka Trump is not a defendant. So why is she testifying? BERNSTEIN: She was a defendant, but her lawyer has successfully argued that because she left the family business for the White House, any alleged actions she was a part of are too old to be a part of a case against her. But her father and brothers continued on with the business. And the way New York law works, their actions, even if old, can be used to establish a continuing conspiracy. To the extent - so to the extent that she was involved with and witnessed those previous actions, her testimony can shed light on the entire scheme. MARTIN: What was her role? BERNSTEIN: Ivanka Trump was involved in the valuations and loans for a couple of key properties. The first was the Doral golf course in Florida near Miami. She oversaw the purchasing of that property, for which the Trumps sought financing from Deutsche Bank. Now, by that time, the Trumps had already had a checkered history with the bank's commercial real estate division. So the Trumps went another route. With her husband, Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump brought in a different division of Deutsche Bank - the private wealth division - and they were willing to loan the Trumps money at a rate so low even Ivanka was astonished. An email was introduced earlier in the trial saying she was inclined not to negotiate because it was such a good rate. But the rate was based on an inflated statement of value, and that's what - at issue in the trial. Did the Trumps get unfairly low rates because they lied? There was testimony from an expert witness that the Trumps saved nearly $170 million in interest from four Deutsche Bank loans by lying on its statements. The Trump defendants could have to pay all that money back to New York state. What exactly Ivanka Trump knew will be key. MARTIN: Wasn't she involved with another property as well? BERNSTEIN: Yes, the Old Post Office in Washington, D.C., which became the Trump International Hotel, perhaps most known as the place where foreign dignitaries and others seeking to impress Donald Trump when he was president would stay. But before that, Ivanka Trump negotiated the lease and yet another bank - Deutsche Bank loan, also at an exceedingly favorable rate. The Trumps were able to sell that property and pay back the loan in full, but that doesn't absolve them under New York business law, which says you're not allowed to run a company based on lies. MARTIN: Is it possible that Ivanka Trump will contradict her father and brothers? BERNSTEIN: So she has in the past. She testified before the House select committee investigating January 6 that she accepted former U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr's conclusion the 2020 election was not stolen. This was a big break from her dad, who continues to falsely insist he won the election. She's not so far been involved in the campaign, while on the last two she was a key surrogate. But she's a twist here. There's a twist here. She was involved in these business activities. Even if she can't be charged, her role may not look so great. She tried awfully hard to get excused from testifying, claiming she's no longer a New York resident and didn't want to leave her family in Florida during the school week, but the New York courts wouldn't have it. MARTIN: And how much longer are we going to see this trial? BERNSTEIN: She's the last witness for the attorney general's case in chief. MARTIN: OK. BERNSTEIN: Then it's the defense case. That'll last until December 15. MARTIN: That is NPR's Andrea Bernstein. Andrea, thank you. BERNSTEIN: Thank you. Copyright © 2023 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Now, by that time, the Trumps had already had a checkered history with the bank's commercial real estate division. So the Trumps went another route. With her husband, Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump brought in a different division of Deutsche Bank - the private wealth division - and they were willing to loan the Trumps money at a rate so low even Ivanka was astonished. An email was introduced earlier in the trial saying she was inclined not to negotiate because it was such a good rate. But the rate was based on an inflated statement of value, and that's what - at issue in the trial. Did the Trumps get unfairly low rates because they lied? There was testimony from an expert witness that the Trumps saved nearly $170 million in interest from four Deutsche Bank loans by lying on its statements. The Trump defendants could have to pay all that money back to New York state. What exactly Ivanka Trump knew will be key. MARTIN: Wasn't she involved with another property as well? BERNSTEIN: Yes, the Old Post Office in Washington, D.C., which became the Trump International Hotel, perhaps most known as the place where foreign dignitaries and others seeking to impress Donald Trump when he was president would stay. But before that, Ivanka Trump negotiated the lease and yet another bank - Deutsche Bank loan, also at an exceedingly favorable rate. The Trumps were able to sell that property and pay back the loan in full, but that doesn't absolve them under New York business law, which says you're not allowed to run a company based on lies. MARTIN: Is it possible that Ivanka Trump will contradict her father and brothers? BERNSTEIN: So she has in the past. She testified before the House select committee investigating January 6 that she accepted former U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr's conclusion the 2020 election was not stolen. This was a big break from her dad, who continues to falsely insist he won the election. She's not so far been involved in the campaign, while on the last two she was a key surrogate. But she's a twist here. There's a twist here. She was involved in these business activities. Even if she can't be charged, her role may not look so great. She tried awfully hard to get excused from testifying, claiming she's no longer a New York resident and didn't want to leave her family in Florida during the school week, but the New York courts wouldn't have it. MARTIN: And how much longer are we going to see this trial? BERNSTEIN: She's the last witness for the attorney general's case in chief. MARTIN: OK. BERNSTEIN: Then it's the defense case. That'll last until December 15. MARTIN: That is NPR's Andrea Bernstein. Andrea, thank you. BERNSTEIN: Thank you. Copyright © 2023 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Former President Donald Trump and others, including Ivanka's brothers Eric and Donald Jr., are accused of taking part in a wide-ranging conspiracy to commit business fraud. The stakes are high. The state's attorney general wants them banned from doing business in New York, along with a $250 million in penalties. Ivanka Trump's testimony could be key. NPR's Andrea Bernstein has been following the trial throughout, and she's with us once again for a preview. Good morning. ANDREA BERNSTEIN, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: OK, so help us understand - Ivanka Trump is not a defendant. So why is she testifying? BERNSTEIN: She was a defendant, but her lawyer has successfully argued that because she left the family business for the White House, any alleged actions she was a part of are too old to be a part of a case against her. But her father and brothers continued on with the business. And the way New York law works, their actions, even if old, can be used to establish a continuing conspiracy. To the extent - so to the extent that she was involved with and witnessed those previous actions, her testimony can shed light on the entire scheme. MARTIN: What was her role? BERNSTEIN: Ivanka Trump was involved in the valuations and loans for a couple of key properties. The first was the Doral golf course in Florida near Miami. She oversaw the purchasing of that property, for which the Trumps sought financing from Deutsche Bank. Now, by that time, the Trumps had already had a checkered history with the bank's commercial real estate division. So the Trumps went another route.

But the rate was based on an inflated statement of value, and that's what - at issue in the trial. Did the Trumps get unfairly low rates because they lied? There was testimony from an expert witness that the Trumps saved nearly $170 million in interest from four Deutsche Bank loans by lying on its statements. The Trump defendants could have to pay all that money back to New York state. What exactly Ivanka Trump knew will be key. MARTIN: Wasn't she involved with another property as well?

But she's a twist here. There's a twist here. She was involved in these business activities. Even if she can't be charged, her role may not look so great. She tried awfully hard to get excused from testifying, claiming she's no longer a New York resident and didn't want to leave her family in Florida during the school week, but the New York courts wouldn't have it. MARTIN: And how much longer are we going to see this trial? BERNSTEIN: She's the last witness for the attorney general's case in chief. MARTIN: OK. BERNSTEIN: Then it's the defense case.

But her father and brothers continued on with the business. And the way New York law works, their actions, even if old, can be used to establish a continuing conspiracy. To the extent - so to the extent that she was involved with and witnessed those previous actions, her testimony can shed light on the entire scheme. MARTIN: What was her role? BERNSTEIN: Ivanka Trump was involved in the valuations and loans for a couple of key properties. The first was the Doral golf course in Florida near Miami. She oversaw the purchasing of that property, for which the Trumps sought financing from Deutsche Bank. Now, by that time, the Trumps had already had a checkered history with the bank's commercial real estate division. So the Trumps went another route. With her husband, Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump brought in a different division of Deutsche Bank - the private wealth division - and they were willing to loan the Trumps money at a rate so low even Ivanka was astonished. An email was introduced earlier in the trial saying she was inclined not to negotiate because it was such a good rate. But the rate was based on an inflated statement of value, and that's what - at issue in the trial. Did the Trumps get unfairly low rates because they lied? There was testimony from an expert witness that the Trumps saved nearly $170 million in interest from four Deutsche Bank loans by lying on its statements. The Trump defendants could have to pay all that money back to New York state. What exactly Ivanka Trump knew will be key. MARTIN: Wasn't she involved with another property as well? BERNSTEIN: Yes, the Old Post Office in Washington, D.C., which became the Trump International Hotel, perhaps most known as the place where foreign dignitaries and others seeking to impress Donald Trump when he was president would stay. But before that, Ivanka Trump negotiated the lease and yet another bank - Deutsche Bank loan, also at an exceedingly favorable rate. The Trumps were able to sell that property and pay back the loan in full, but that doesn't absolve them under New York business law, which says you're not allowed to run a company based on lies. MARTIN: Is it possible that Ivanka Trump will contradict her father and brothers? BERNSTEIN: So she has in the past. She testified before the House select committee investigating January 6 that she accepted former U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr's conclusion the 2020 election was not stolen.

      "text": "Exclusive: White House And Ivanka Trump Propose New Spending On Child Care\n\nTamara Keith\n\nSenior White House adviser Ivanka Trump, President Trump's daughter, has crafted an increase in child care funding as part of the White House's budget proposal set to be released on Monday. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images hide caption\n\nSenior White House adviser Ivanka Trump, President Trump's daughter, has crafted an increase in child care funding as part of the White House's budget proposal set to be released on Monday.\n\nIn the midst of a presidential budget proposal destined to generate controversy for its expected drastic spending cuts, White House senior adviser and first daughter Ivanka Trump wants to have a conversation about increasing the availability and affordability of child care.\n\nNPR has learned that the 2020 White House budget set to be released Monday will call for increased spending on child care and propose an initiative to address shortages.\n\nPresidential budgets are policy statements, frequently ignored by Congress, and this one is no different (It has already been declared a \"nonstarter\" by Democrats.) So in a way, this is Ivanka Trump and the White House signaling that they want in on a debate already underway in the business world and in politics about this \"ever growing challenge.\"\n\n\"You have care providers who are working at below poverty wages, you have parents who can't afford the care and you don't have a robust ecosystem of facilities because it's a low-margin business with high liability,\" said Ivanka Trump on the sidelines of a discussion she recently led at the White House with about more than a dozen people who specialize in child care. \"So, it's like just a fundamentally flawed system.\"\n\nNPR was invited to the West Wing listening session in late February and was given early details of the child care proposal from Ivanka Trump that is included in the president's 2020 budget.\n\nOne-time investment\n\nThe centerpiece is a proposed one-time investment of $1 billion to increase the supply of child care to underserved populations. States would apply for funding and could use it to encourage employers large and small to invest in child care or to support child care providers that operate during nontraditional work hours or that cater to parents who are enrolled in school.\n\n\"We want to encourage innovation,\" said Ivanka Trump. \"We want to encourage the private sector to step up.\"\n\nTo get the money, states would have to \"establish targets for reducing unnecessary regulatory or other requirements that limit the supply or increase the cost of child care.\" A White House aide said this isn't meant to roll back regulations on child-to-caregiver ratios but rather to get rid of zoning requirements in some areas that don't allow child care centers in residential districts, for instance.\n\nIt would be implemented through the Child Care and Development Block Grant program, which in the past two years saw its funding significantly boosted by Congress in spending bills ultimately signed by President Trump. A White House official, who declined to speak on the record because the budget is not yet public, said the president's 2020 budget proposal calls for spending $5.3 billion on the program, the same level that Congress set aside in 2019 and a big increase over what past Trump administration budgets asked for. The $1 billion one-time fund would come on top of that.\n\nIvanka Trump said, \"Continuing to make sure we fund the programs adequately\" is key, while also talking up the increase in the child tax credit included in the Republican tax law passed in late 2017.\n\nTrump greeted the researchers, child care providers and representatives of business groups in the Roosevelt Room before going around the table asking about challenges and soliciting ideas for solutions. She chimed in occasionally to amplify someone's point or to ask questions.\n\nHere are some of the challenges that Trump and the experts she met with identified in that White House meeting: The early years are critical for brain development but quality, safe, affordable child care is often hard to come by. There are mile-long waiting lists for care that, for many families, costs more than their housing. And yet, a lot of child care workers can't make ends meet.\n\nAs Trump talked about the challenges, she framed it in a way that Democrats have for years - not as a \"mom's problem\" or a \"families' problem\" but as an impediment to economic growth.\n\nEconomic strain\n\nChad Dunkley, CEO of New Horizon Academy, a child care provider, attended the listening session and has advocated for more child care funding on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"I think there's a growing bipartisan consensus that we have to do more to build the financial security of young families in this country,\" said Dunkley. \"They have to feel confident they can grow their families here, and if they don't, our economy is going to be in trouble.\"\n\nThat economic strain is already evident in low birthrates and stalled labor force participation, Dunkley said.\n\nThe White House was asked about proposed funding levels in the 2020 budget for Head Start, another major early childhood program, but that information was not forthcoming.\n\nPresident Trump included child care in his 2016 campaign, and as his re-election efforts ramp up, the White House has put a focus on selling the idea that he has kept his campaign promises. That said, this new proposal isn't remotely close to what Trump campaigned on.\n\nCampaign issue for Democrats\n\nIt comes as child care is already a 2020 campaign issue, with Democratic candidates, including Elizabeth Warren, rolling out child care-for-all plans.\n\n\"How much you make at your job should not determine the quality of care your child gets. That's why for millions of families who need it, access to these child care options will be free,\" Warren said in a video announcing her plan.\n\nIn Congress there are child care bills from Democrats in both the House and the Senate designed to stimulate growth in child care availability, defray costs for families that can't afford it and pay providers a living wage. The price tags on these plans run tens of billions of dollars each year, vastly more than the White House proposal.\n\nThe White House official said these Democratic plans would cost \"unsustainable amounts of taxpayer dollars,\" adding that Ivanka Trump sees her role as \"an advocate for producing legislation that actually has a viable path forward.\"\n\nAsked if she could work with Ivanka Trump on child care, Sen. Patty Murray from Washington state, a leading Democrat on the issue, was polite.\n\n\"I'm excited that more people are aware of the barrier that child care is to working families in order to achieve their economic dreams and take care of their families,\" said Murray. \"So we welcome all ideas, but they have to be real ideas.\"\n\nThere's plenty of agreement on the problems but not yet on the solutions. Asked which members of Congress the Trump administration had reached out to on the issue, the White House official said simply that Ivanka Trump looks forward to working with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "Ivanka Trump Launches $50 Million Program To Give Women More Power In The Workplace\n\nBy\n\nJoanne Lu\n\nIvanka Trump speaks at a roundtable for the Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative at the White House on February 7. Evan Vucci/AP hide caption\n\nIvanka Trump speaks at a roundtable for the Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative at the White House on February 7.\n\nFirst daughter Ivanka Trump wants to help 50 million women around the world \"realize their economic potential\" by 2025.\n\nExperts who work with women's issues in the global development community are hopeful about the new initiative - but raise questions about the timing of the announcement and the lack of specifics.\n\nTrump, a senior adviser to President Trump, announced the Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative last week in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal .\n\nIt aims to get all U.S. foreign assistance agencies - including the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Peace Corps and six others - to give top priority to push for women's economic development.\n\nAnd it sets up a $50 million fund for USAID to invest in new programs that can help make it easier for women to find jobs, start their own businesses and do business. A White House press conference about the initiative identified the range of women who might be helped, from a dairy farmer in Georgia to the founder of a women's group in Malawi.\n\n\"This new initiative will for the first time coordinate America's commitment to one of the most undervalued resources in the developing world - the talent, ambition and genius of women,\" Trump wrote in the Journal.\n\nIn a memorandum , President Trump said the initiative will build on his administration's \"growing portfolio\" of women's economic empowerment programs, including the \"Ivanka Fund\" - a World Bank project that she created to award grants to development banks to support women entrepreneurs around the world - and other efforts at USAID and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC).\n\nThe initiative has three main focuses, or \"pillars,\" as the administration calls it: providing women with the education and skills training they need to enter the workforce; helping them succeed as business owners through financing, access to markets and networks; and addressing other barriers - legal, regulatory and cultural - that keep them from working.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, 2.7 billion women in 112 countries are legally excluded from certain industries, like mining and construction or other jobs deemed \"morally inappropriate,\" like serving alcohol or working in casinos. It's also legal in 18 countries for husbands to prevent their wives from working.\n\nThe presidential memorandum calls on U.S. foreign assistance agencies to dedicate at least $300 million annually to programs that advance the three pillars, while the $50 million USAID fund will finance additional programs. The initiative also plans to advance its goals through partnerships with non-governmental organizations and private companies, like Pepsi and UPS.\n\nNancy Lee, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development and a former U.S. Treasury official, says the initiative could be truly transformative if it actually brings women's issues to the forefront of all development efforts - whether that means including women in the efforts of farmers to bring food to market or inviting them to be leaders in a peace-building efforts.\n\n\"At USAID, we're thrilled,\" said USAID Administrator Mark Green at a press briefing last week. \"We've been working on women's empowerment, but now we have an across-the-board interagency effort, the full force of the U.S. government behind this.\"\n\nBut some - especially development experts who have designed such initiatives - are concerned that without specific goals and more details, it's just a political show.\n\n\"All I've seen about this initiative is a whole lot of generic talk of the importance of empowering women without actually setting out a plan or a clear roadmap how to get there,\" says Brett Bruen, president of the Global Situation Room and former director of global engagement in the Obama administration.\n\nHe believes the initiative is just a way to enhance the administration's reputation ahead of the 2020 presidential elections, especially in the wake of cuts to global women's programs from the Trump administration.\n\nLast year, President Trump proposed a 35 percent funding cut for global gender-equality programs, though Congress eventually rejected the cuts. The Trump administration has also reinstated what's known as the global gag rule to block U.S. aid money from funding any organizations that perform abortions, offer information about the procedure or support more liberal abortion laws.\n\nDevelopment experts, on Twitter and beyond, say that if this initiative must address topics like reproductive rights and health or else women will not have the freedom to fully participate in the workforce.\n\nGlobal women's empowerment means looking at the many ways they are disempowered daily - violence, lack of choice when it comes to their own bodies, and discrimination ... and then changing those things that hold them back. That is meaningful empowerment. https://t.co/k8tdCmyZgH\n\nThe bedrock of a woman's empowerment is the human right to decide when and if to have children. No full participation in the work force or eco empowerment without access to #familyplanning , sexuality education, safe #abortion . Must be included if new #WGDP is to be a success. https://t.co/t7IGDjQZZO\n\nIt has not yet been disclosed what kind of proposals will be submitted by whom for the benefit of which 50 million women. Even if USAID targets the most vulnerable women in developing countries with that fund, so far, there have been no official public stipulations to ensure that they - not elite women in those countries - will receive the rest of the aid.\n\n\"Making sure that the poorest and most marginalized populations are reached is a critical piece of this initiative,\" says Aria Grabowski, senior policy adviser for Oxfam America . \"We're hopeful that it will target some of the women who need it most.\"\n\nJoanne Lu is a freelance journalist who covers global poverty and inequity.

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\nNew York prosecutors were preparing a case. Then the D.A. overruled his staff after a visit from a top donor: Trump attorney Marc Kasowitz.\n\nby Jesse Eisinger and Justin Elliott , ProPublica, and Andrea Bernstein and Ilya Marritz , WNYC\n\nThis article is a collaboration between ProPublica, WNYC and The New Yorker and is not subject to our Creative Commons license.\n\nIn the spring of 2012, Donald Trump's two eldest children, Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr., found themselves in a precarious legal position. For two years, prosecutors in the Manhattan District Attorney's office had been building a criminal case against them for misleading prospective buyers of units in the Trump SoHo, a hotel and condo development that was failing to sell. Despite the best efforts of the siblings' defense team, the case had not gone away. An indictment seemed like a real possibility. The evidence included emails from the Trumps making clear that they were aware they were using inflated figures about how well the condos were selling to lure buyers.\n\nHear the audio version of this story on WNYC.\n\nIn one email, according to four people who have seen it, the Trumps discussed how to coordinate false information they had given to prospective buyers. In another, according to a person who read the emails, they worried that a reporter might be onto them. In yet another, Donald Jr. spoke reassuringly to a broker who was concerned about the false statements, saying that nobody would ever find out, because only people on the email chain or in the Trump Organization knew about the deception, according to a person who saw the email.\n\nThere was \"no doubt\" that the Trump children \"approved, knew of, agreed to, and intentionally inflated the numbers to make more sales,\" one person who saw the emails told us. \"They knew it was wrong.\"\n\nIn 2010, when the Major Economic Crimes Bureau of the D.A.'s office opened an investigation of the siblings, the Trump Organization had hired several top New York criminal defense lawyers to represent Donald Jr. and Ivanka. These attorneys had met with prosecutors in the bureau several times. They conceded that their clients had made exaggerated claims, but argued that the overstatements didn't amount to criminal misconduct. Still, the case dragged on. In a meeting with the defense team, Donald Trump, Sr., expressed frustration that the investigation had not been closed. Soon after, his longtime personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz entered the case.\n\nKasowitz, who by then had been the elder Donald Trump's attorney for a decade, is primarily a civil litigator with little experience in criminal matters. But in 2012, Kasowitz donated $25,000 to the reelection campaign of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., making Kasowitz one of Vance's largest donors. Kasowitz decided to bypass the lower level prosecutors and went directly to Vance to ask that the investigation be dropped.\n\nOn May 16, 2012, Kasowitz visited Vance's office at One Hogan Place in downtown Manhattan - a faded edifice made famous by the television show, \"Law & Order.\" Dan Alonso, the chief assistant district attorney, and Adam Kaufmann, the chief of the investigative division, were also at the meeting, but no one from the Major Economic Crimes Bureau attended. Kasowitz did not introduce any new arguments or facts during his session. He simply repeated the arguments that the other defense lawyers had been making for months.\n\nUltimately, Vance overruled his own prosecutors. Three months after the meeting, he told them to drop the case. Kasowitz subsequently boasted to colleagues about representing the Trump children, according to two people. He said that the case was \"really dangerous,\" one person said, and that it was \"amazing I got them off.\" (Kasowitz denied making such a statement.)\n\nVance defended his decision. \"I did not at the time believe beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime had been committed,\" he told us. \"I had to make a call and I made the call, and I think I made the right call.\"\n\nJust before the 2012 meeting, Vance's campaign had returned Kasowitz's $25,000 contribution, in keeping with what Vance describes as standard practice when a donor has a case before his office. Kasowitz \"had no influence and his contributions had no influence whatsoever on my decision-making in the case,\" Vance said.\n\nBut less than six months after the D.A.'s office dropped the case, Kasowitz made an even larger donation to Vance's campaign, and helped raise more from others - eventually, a total of more than $50,000. After being asked about these donations as part of the reporting for this article - more than four years after the fact - Vance said he now plans to give back Kasowitz's second contribution, too. \"I don't want the money to be a millstone around anybody's neck, including the office's,\" he said.\n\nKasowitz told us his donations to Vance were unrelated to the case. \"I donated to Cy Vance's campaign because I was and remain extremely impressed by him as a person of impeccable integrity, as a brilliant lawyer and as a public servant with creative ideas and tremendous ability,\" Kasowitz wrote in an emailed statement. \"I have never made a contribution to anyone's campaign, including Cy Vance's, as a 'quid-pro-quo' for anything.\"\n\nLast year, The New York Times reported the existence of the criminal investigation into the Trump SoHo project. But the prosecutor's focus on Ivanka and Donald Jr. and the email evidence against them, as well as Kasowitz's involvement, and Vance's decision to overrule his prosecutors, had not been previously made public. This account is based on interviews with 20 sources familiar with the investigation, court records, and other public documents. We were not able to review copies of the emails that were the focal point of the inquiry. We are relying on the accounts of multiple individuals who have seen them.\n\nRequests for interviews with Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. were referred to Alan Garten, the chief legal officer of the Trump Organization. In an emailed response, Garten did not address a list of questions about the criminal case. Instead, he quoted the company's filings in civil litigation relating to the Trump SoHo, which described complaints as \"a simple case of buyers' remorse.\"\n\nBut even a lawyer in the Trump camp acknowledges that the way the case was resolved was unusual. \"Dropping the case was reasonable,\" said Paul Grand, a partner at Morvillo Abramowitz who was part of the Trump SoHo defense team. \"The manner in which it was accomplished is curious.\"\n\nGrand, who was a partner of Vance's when the district attorney was in private practice, said he did not believe that the D.A.'s office had evidence of criminal misconduct by the Trump children. But the meeting between Vance and Kasowitz \"didn't have an air you'd like,\" he said. \"If you and I were district attorney and you knew that a subject of an investigation was represented by two or three well-thought-of lawyers in town, and all of a sudden someone who was a contributor to your campaign showed up on your doorstep, and the regular lawyers are nowhere to be seen, you'd think about how you'd want to proceed.\"\n\nIn June 2006, during the season finale of \"The Apprentice,\" Donald Trump Sr. unveiled the Trump SoHo as a visionary project. The luxury development was intended to mark the ascension of Ivanka and Donald Jr. - then 24 and 28 years old, respectively - as full players in the Trump empire. They signed the licensing deal alongside their father, and photographs of Ivanka were featured in the Trump SoHo's advertising, under the tagline \"Possess your own SoHo.\"\n\nTheir partners on the project included two Soviet-born businessmen, Felix Sater and Tevfik Arif, who ran the Bayrock Group, a real estate development firm. Sater had a history of running afoul of the law. In 1993, he was convicted of assault and spent about a year in prison for attacking a man with the stem of a margarita glass in a bar fight. In 1998, he pleaded guilty to one count of racketeering for his role in a $40 million securities fraud scheme.\n\nThe Trump SoHo was beleaguered from the start: Named for one of Manhattan's trendiest neighborhoods, the development wasn't really in SoHo, but located just west of it, near the entrance ramp to the Holland Tunnel. Zoning laws wouldn't allow a residential tower at the location, so the Trumps fell back on an alternative: a \"condo-hotel,\" in which buyers got a hotel room rather than an apartment, and were legally prohibited from staying there more than 120 nights per year. Worse, the high-priced condos hit the market in September 2007, just as the global economy began to crater in what became the largest financial crisis since the Great Depression.\n\nBusiness was slow, but the Trump family claimed the opposite. In April 2008, they said that 31 percent of the condos in the building had been purchased. Donald Jr. boasted to The Real Deal magazine that 55 percent of the units had been bought. In June 2008, Donald Jr. and Ivanka, alongside their brother Eric, gathered the foreign press at Trump Tower in Manhattan, where Ivanka announced that 60 percent had been snapped up. \"We're in a very fortunate position,\" she said, \"where we have enough sales and now we are strategically targeting certain buyers.\"\n\nNone of that was true. According to a sworn affidavit by a Trump partner filed with the New York attorney general's office, by March of 2010, almost two years after the press conference, only 15.8 percent of units had been sold.\n\nThis was more than a marketing problem. The deal hinged on selling at least 15 percent of the units. By law, the sales couldn't close with anything less. The Trumps and their partners would have had to return the buyers' down payments.\n\nSome buyers concluded that they'd been cheated. In August 2010, some sued the Trump Organization and others involved in the project in New York federal court. \"This action seeks to redress the substantial and ongoing pattern of fraudulent misrepresentations and deceptive sales practices\" by the Trumps and the other defendants, the suit charged. The plaintiffs argued that there's a vast difference in value between a unit in a building that is 15 percent sold and one that is 60 percent sold. Their complaint accused the sellers, including the Trumps, of \"a consistent and concerted pattern of outright lies.\"\n\nAfter the civil suit was filed, the Manhattan district attorney's office opened a criminal investigation. Prosecutors are often wary of getting involved in a dispute between wealthy litigants. But in this instance, according to a person familiar with their thinking, the lawyers in the Major Economic Crimes Bureau quickly concluded that there was enough to warrant an investigation. They believed that Ivanka and Donald Jr., might have violated the Martin Act, a New York statute that bans any false statement in conjunction with the sale of a security or real estate. Prosecutors also saw potential fraud and larceny charges, applying a legal theory that, by overstating the number of units sold, the Trump were falsely inflating their value and, in effect, cheating unsuspecting condo buyers.\n\nPeirce Moser, an assistant district attorney known for his methodical, comprehensive investigations, soon took over the case. \"He is not a cowboy,\" Marc Scholl, who spent almost 40 years as a prosecutor in the district attorney's office, said. \"He is certainly not out to make headlines for himself or to advance himself.\"\n\nOn the other side, the Trumps' defense team included Gary Naftalis and David Frankel, of the law firm Kramer Levin; Paul Grand represented one of the real estate brokers who had worked with the Trumps.\n\nAs the investigation progressed, Vance suffered an embarrassing setback in one of his highest profile cases. In the summer of 2011, his office had abandoned a sexual assault case against the former managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Vance, who was pummeled in the press afterward, denied in his interview with us that the case made him reluctant to take on another prominent defendant.\n\nA few months later, on Jan. 11, 2012, Marc Kasowitz contributed $25,000 to Vance's campaign, unbeknownst to prosecutors in the Major Economic Crimes Bureau, who continued their work. Moser was particularly focused on email correspondence, according to seven people familiar with the case.\n\nThe prosecutors began considering impaneling a special grand jury, according to a person familiar with the investigation. That would have represented a significant escalation in the case, because it is often a prelude to indictments. With a grand jury in place, defense lawyers knew the risk of indictment was high.\n\nThe defense team offered a deal to stave off this possibility, floating the possibility of a settlement of some kind, including a deferred prosecution agreement, which would have meant the corporate equivalent of probation for the Trump Organization. With the investigation appearing to gather momentum, Naftalis and Grand, who had already met with the prosecutors twice, began to step up their campaign against the case. Grand calls this the \"internal appellate process.\" Particularly when well-heeled or high-profile defendants are involved, there can be a multi-month advocacy process that slowly makes its way up the hierarchy inside the Manhattan D.A.'s office.\n\nGrand and Naftalis decided that it would be unwise to go over the heads of the staff prosecutors. Instead, on April 18, 2012, they sent a letter to Adam Kaufmann, then chief of the investigative division (he's now in private practice), outlining their arguments.\n\nAfter hearing Rachel Maddow discuss our recent story about Kasowitz, a man emailed the attorney urging him to resign. Kasowitz responded with threats and profanity.\n\nThe next day, the defense lawyers met with Moser, Kaufmann, and others from the prosecution team. The defense team acknowledged that the Trumps made some exaggerated statements in order to sell the units. But this was mere \"puffery\"- harmless exaggeration. Such language, they contended, didn't amount to criminal conduct. The Trumps weren't selling useless swampland in Florida. The condos existed. And the buyers' money was in escrow the entire time.\n\nThe defense lawyers argued that bringing such a case to trial would be wasteful and that resources would be better spent on more serious offenses. As Grand put it to us during our recent interview, \"I guess in a world that is completely pure and where there is no deviation between propriety and the law, that kind of exaggeration and deliberately concentrated exaggeration can be pursued. But is that the kind of criminal law enforcement the D.A. should be doing?\"\n\nMoser's answer seemed to be \"yes,\" and he found support among his supervisors. Moser had prepared an elaborate PowerPoint presentation, featuring dozens of emails that prosecutors believed showed that Ivanka and Donald Jr. had repeatedly lied to buyers. \"You couldn't have had a better email trail,\" a person familiar with the investigation told us.\n\nAt the meeting, Kaufmann peppered the defense team with questions, at one point raising his voice, according to a person who was there. \"I believed in the case,\" Kaufmann told us, though he declined to discuss the evidence. \"But believing in the case doesn't mean we had reached the point when [I had] settled on what should happen with the case.\"\n\nWhite-collar criminal cases are often challenging to bring because of their complexity. And, by the time of the April meeting, prosecutors knew that they faced another impediment, this one created by legal maneuvers in the Trumps' civil case. Five months earlier, the Trumps and their partners had reached a settlement with the disgruntled buyers. The defendants agreed to return 90 percent of the buyers' deposits, plus their attorneys' fees. But they extracted a rare concession in return: The plaintiffs agreed not to cooperate with prosecutors unless they were subpoenaed. (Garten, the Trump Organization's chief legal officer, noted that the settlement terms were confidential and declined to comment on them.)\n\nAdam Leitman Bailey, the attorney for the buyers, had been helping prosecutors. Now he provided aid to the Trumps, writing a letter to the district attorney that stated: \"We acknowledge that the Defendants have not violated the criminal laws of the State of New York or the United States.\" In our interview with Vance, he said he had never before seen a letter where plaintiffs in a civil case asserted that no crime had been committed. \"I don't think I'd ever received a letter like it,\" Vance said. He calls it a \"significant and important\" communication.\n\nCertainly, prosecutors could subpoena the buyers of Trump condos. But they feared the witnesses would undercut the criminal case by claiming they weren't victims of a fraud.\n\nStill, Moser, backed by his supervisors, persisted. \"Peirce believed in his case,\" Grand said. \"We did not succeed in talking him out of it and didn't succeed in talking one or two levels above him into dropping the case.\"\n\nFinally, in the spring of 2012, Kasowitz joined the case. His involvement \"came from out of the blue,\" Grand told us. He and the other lawyers assumed Kasowitz intervened at the request of Donald Trump Sr.\n\nIn early May 2012, Kasowitz asked to see the District Attorney. Vance told us such meetings aren't unusual - but his investigations chief at the time, Kaufmann, characterized Kasowitz's request as \"a little premature.\" The Trump lawyer was going over the heads of everyone who had been working on the case. The gathering, on May 16, lasted 20 to 30 minutes, according to Vance. Kasowitz repeated the arguments the defense team had made before.\n\nAfterward, Kasowitz didn't seem to think his clients were in the clear. On Aug. 1, he suggested a settlement, proposing that the Trump Organization would not admit to wrongdoing but would agree not to mislead people in the future and would submit to outside monitoring. The offer proved unnecessary. Two days later, on Aug. 3, 2012, Moser called the Trumps' defense attorneys and told them prosecutors were dropping the investigation. (Moser, who still works for Vance, now as senior investigative counsel, did not respond to requests for an interview made over multiple months. Shortly before this article was published, he sent an email stating that Vance's ultimate decision in the case \"was not unreasonable\" and that throughout the process, the D.A. asked \"smart questions\" and expressed \"reasonable skepticism.\")\n\nIn his interview, Vance defended his decision to drop the case with no conditions, even after Kasowitz offered a deal. \"This started as a civil case,\" Vance said. \"It was settled as a civil case with a statement by the purchasers of luxury properties that they weren't victims. And at the end of the day, I felt if we were not going to charge criminally, we should leave it as a civil case in the posture in which it came to us.\"\n\nIn September 2012, within weeks of the case being resolved, Kasowitz contacted Vance's campaign about hosting a fundraiser, according to a spokesperson for the campaign. Kasowitz held the event that January. He personally donated almost $32,000 to Vance's campaign, and 20 of his law firm's partners and employees kicked in at least another $9,000. Then, in October 2013, as Election Day approached, he hosted a breakfast -\"Republicans for Cy Vance\" - which raised an additional $9,000.\n\nVance defended his decision to accept the money Kasowitz sent his way. \"We did the right thing,\" he said, referring to the decision to drop the case. \"Another five and a half months go by. Marc Kasowitz has no matter pending before the office for the Trumps or anybody else. It's 2013 and it's an election - and I welcome his support.\" Vance noted that New York law allowed him to accept such a contribution. Still, he now intends to return the money to Kasowitz.\n\nIvanka Trump is now an adviser to the president, with an office in the West Wing. Donald Jr. is running much of the family empire while his father is in the White House. Kasowitz attained national prominence when he was retained to represent the president in the Russia investigation, only to be supplanted as lead counsel. Vance is running unopposed for reelection in November. The Trump SoHo went into foreclosure in 2014 and was taken over by a creditor. Only 128 of the 391 units in the building have sold. That comes out to around 33 percent.\n\nDerek Kravitz and Leora Smith of ProPublica contributed reporting to this article, as did Keenan Chen, Alex Mierjeski, Inti Pacheco and Manuela Andreoni of Columbia Journalism Investigations.\n\nUpdate, Oct. 16, 2017: District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. announced Oct. 15 that he has ordered an independent review of how his office handles campaign contributions and that he will not accept any further donations until the review is completed.\n\nThe move follows our story about the Trump SoHo investigation as well as renewed scrutiny of Vance's decision not to charge movie executive Harvey Weinstein for allegedly groping an Italian model in 2015.\n\n\"I'm prepared to dramatically restrict who can donate money to our campaign - including lawyers - and the amounts that our contributors are able to give,\" Vance wrote in an op-ed in the New York Daily News.\n\nThe 90-day review will be conducted by Center for the Advancement of Public Integrity at Columbia Law School. The recommendations of the center will be made public, Manhattan DA spokeswoman Joan Vollero told ProPublica.\n\nFiled under:\n\nJesse Eisinger\n\nJesse Eisinger is a senior editor and reporter at ProPublica.

The hotel, and by extension the Trump family, was paid far above market rate, according to internal documents the attorney general obtained by subpoena.\n\nAs WNYC and ProPublica's \"Trump, Inc.\" revealed, the Trump inaugural committee paid the Trump Organization over Wolkoff's objections, which Ivanka had been aware of.\n\nDocuments uncovered by the D.C. attorney general contradict earlier statements by spokespeople for the Trumps that they had little or no involvement in the negotiations.\n\n\"The president was focused on the transition during that time and not on any of the planning for the inauguration,\" Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in December 2018.\n\nPeter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Ivanka Trump's ethics lawyer, told WNYC and ProPublica in 2018 that Ivanka had only been contacted once about inauguration spending at Trump's hotel: \"Ms. Trump was not involved in any additional discussions.\"\n\nThe attorney general's documents show deeper involvement.\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nIvanka Trump was made aware of concerns about overpayment in a Dec. 12, 2016, email from Rick Gates, the deputy to the inaugural chairman, which she responded to two days later. On Dec. 16, Wolkoff raised her concerns in person with Donald and Ivanka Trump. The next day, Wolkoff again objected to the Trump hotel's proposed rates.\n\n\"These events are in PE's [the president-elect's] honor at his hotel and one of them is for family and close friends,\" she wrote in an email to Ivanka and Gates. \"Please take into consideration that when this is audited it will become public knowledge.\"\n\nOther venues hosting inauguration events provided space for free.\n\nOn Jan. 10, 2017, the inaugural committee finalized its contract with the hotel at $175,000 per day, over Wolkoff's objections. The committee was also charged for days when it wasn't even using the space, the suit says.\n\nOne event, costing more than $300,000, was a private reception at the Trump hotel \"benefiting only the children of the President,\" the complaint says.\n\n\"DJT is not expected to attend but was more for you, Don and Eric,\" Gates wrote in an email to Ivanka Trump several days before the event, according to the complaint.\n\nA spokesperson for the Trump Organization dismissed the D.C. suit in an emailed statement:\n\n\"The AG's claims are false, intentionally misleading and riddled with inaccuracies. The rates charged by the hotel were completely in line with what anyone else would have been charged for an unprecedented event of this enormous magnitude and were reflective of the fact that [sic] hotel had just recently opened, possessed superior facilities and was centrally located on Pennsylvania Avenue. The AG's after the fact attempt to regulate what discounts it believes the hotel should have provided as well as the timing of this complaint reeks of politics and is a clear PR stunt.\"\n\nSpokespeople for the inaugural committee, the White House and Ivanka Trump did not immediately comment. A spokesman for the IRS, which regulates charities, said \"federal law prohibits the IRS from discussing specific taxpayers.\"\n\nThe Trump inaugural appears to have overpaid for space at Trump's Washington hotel, a possible violation of the law. Federal prosecutors are probing the festivities.\n\nD.C. is asking the court to compel the Trump Organization to place at least $1,033,757 in a trust, so the money can be allocated \"to another nonprofit entity dedicated to promoting civic engagement of the citizens of the United States of America.\"\n\nThe Trump inaugural committee drew scrutiny from the moment it first reported its financials. The committee raised nearly $107 million, close to double the haul of President Barack Obama's record-setting 2009 bash, despite being a much smaller event. Past inaugural planners said they would struggle to spend a sum of money that large.\n\n\"It's inexplicable to me,\" Greg Jenkins, who led former President George W. Bush's second inaugural committee, told \"Trump, Inc.\"\n\nStay up to date with email updates about WNYC and ProPublica's investigations into the president's business practices.\n\n* You can contact us via Signal, WhatsApp or voicemail at 347-244-2134.

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\nPresident Trump's eldest daughter said she'd give up management of her businesses. We checked.\n\nby Derek Kravitz and Al Shaw\n\nWhen Donald Trump promised in early January to hand over control of his businesses before becoming president, Trump's daughter, Ivanka, pledged to do the same thing.\n\n\"I will no longer be involved with the management or operations of the Trump Organization,\" Ivanka Trump wrote on Facebook . Ivanka said that she would take a \"formal leave of absence\" when her father was sworn in.\n\nYet Ivanka is still listed as running Trump businesses on active state liquor licenses in Florida and New York, as of Thursday afternoon. The licenses cover two golf clubs, a resort and a hotel. ProPublica obtained the documents and records through open-records requests.\n\nBeing listed on a license means that person is considered the responsible manager of a business. For example, that is who is responsible for business contracts.\n\nIvanka Trump is also still listed in New York state business filings as the chief executive officer of her eponymous jewelry companies in Florida and New York. Her personal Twitter and Facebook accounts also still link directly to her corporate website.\n\nIn response to questions, the Trump Organization said Ivanka resigned from all \"positions of management and authority\" on Jan. 18 and that the company simply hasn't filed the changes yet. \"We are taking steps to update records in the various states and other jurisdictions consistent with governing law,\" the company said in its statement.\n\nThe Trump Organization did not give us any company documents showing Ivanka Trump's resignation.\n\nBoth Florida and New York require that any changes in leadership be recorded on liquor licenses within 10 business days of the move. If Ivanka Trump had resigned Jan. 18, the states' deadline for changes would have been Feb. 1.\n\nIvanka's name was taken off a Washington, D.C., liquor license at the new Trump International Hotel last week.\n\nThe missing filings mirror Donald Trump's then-absent paperwork that we detailed on Inauguration Day. The Trump Organization later released a company letter declaring his resignation from more than 400 companies. It has since filed paperwork in Florida showing Trump resigning from at least 22 companies. His name was also taken off a North Carolina liquor license in early January and the District of Columbia license last week.\n\nMany ethics and tax experts across the political spectrum have said that Trump's promises are far from enough . They say that the president needs to either sell his companies or put them in a blind trust run by an outsider.\n\nTrump's resignation letter \"doesn't say anything about the underlying economic interests in the companies he continues to have,\" said Lawrence Hamermesh, director of the Widener Institute of Delaware Corporate and Business Law.\n\nTo transfer control of his companies, the president has to submit filings in Florida, Delaware and New York. We spoke to officials in each of those states. Read the story.\n\nIncoming President Donald Trump's business deals span the globe. We asked the Trump Organization about each of these deals. Read the story.\n\nTrump has said his businesses have been placed in a trust to be run by his two adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, and a longtime Trump employee. A chief compliance officer and outside ethics adviser for the Trump Organization were named last week, along with a new White House counsel overseeing ethics policies.\n\nRecently filings in Washington list President Trump as the \"exclusive\" beneficiary of the trust.\n\nTrump's businesses have already faced questions about whether they are profiting off of the commander-in-chief's increased exposure. Mar-A-Lago, the members-only golf club in Florida, doubled its initiation fees for new members to $200,000 on Jan. 1 , citing increased demand. Trump Hotels' CEO also recently floated the idea of expanding in the U.S.\n\nIn recent years, Ivanka Trump's star has risen, and her clothing and jewelry lines have flourished. Her clothing line saw a nearly $30 million increase in sales through just one of her distributors last year.\n\nShe was criticized when her jewelry company sent out an email promoting a bracelet she wore during a November appearance on the TV news program \"60 Minutes.\" Her husband, Jared Kushner, has his own business empire: Kushner Companies, a real-estate development company started by his father. Kushner has also stepped down from his company, and sold some of his real-estate holdings and other assets, to take a role in advising the White House .\n\nBecause the Trump Organization is made up of privately held companies and living trusts, much of its official business can be done out of public view, corporate attorneys say. A private company's ownership structure - specifically who has equity in the company - is not a matter of public record.\n\nWhile changes to management have to be filed in liquor licenses, other internal operating agreements of private companies can be changed without public filings. Trump businesses are required to give banks copies of non-public governing documents detailing their officers and bylaws. Title companies would also require similar information if they were working on current deals. These filings are also not public.\n\nProPublica received copies of some Trump company internal operating agreements, as part of our Washington, D.C., open-records request, but these records do not include information about specific ownership stakes.\n\nElisabeth Gawthrop and Alison Gregor contributed to this report.\n\nUpdate, Feb. 2, 2017 at 5:20 p.m.: Ivanka Trump's Twitter and Facebook pages no longer have links to her corporate website.\n\nUpdate, Feb. 2, 2017 at 7:40 p.m.: Alan Garten, the Trump Organization's chief legal officer, told ProPublica that Ivanka Trump has signed all necessary paperwork to resign from her companies and that the filings are in the process of being updated with various states or are being sent. \"Effective tomorrow, everything will be done,\" he said.\n\nUpdate, Feb. 7, 2017 at 5:47 p.m.: In New York, the Trump Organization filed corporate change applications Tuesday for Trump Tower, Trump Golf Links in the Bronx, Trump National Golf Club Westchester and the Trump National Golf Club Hudson Valley, according to the State Liquor Authority.\n\nStill missing are new corporate change applications for the Trump International Hotel & Tower at Columbus Circle, which lists President Trump, and the Trump SoHo hotel, which lists both the president and his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, on its liquor licenses.\n\nBoth President Trump and Ivanka Trump are listed as officers on the Illinois liquor license for the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago, state officials confirmed Monday to ProPublica. Documents filed Jan. 9 list both Trumps, along with Donald Trump Jr.\n\nTrump Organization companies have been listed on 19 liquor licenses in nine states.

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\nSeries: Trump, Inc.\n\nAs the inaugural committee planned the landmark celebration, internal concerns were raised about whether Trump's Washington hotel was overcharging for event space. The spending could be a violation of the law.\n\nby Ilya Marritz , WNYC , and Justin Elliott , ProPublica\n\nExploring the Business of Trump\n\nFind \"Trump, Inc.\" wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nWhen it came out this year that President Donald Trump's inaugural committee raised and spent unprecedented amounts, people wondered where all that money went.\n\nIt turns out one beneficiary was Trump himself.\n\nThe inauguration paid the Trump Organization for rooms, meals and event space at the company's Washington hotel, according to interviews as well as internal emails and receipts reviewed by WNYC and ProPublica.\n\nDuring the planning, Ivanka Trump, the president-elect's eldest daughter and a senior executive with the Trump Organization, was involved in negotiating the price the hotel charged the 58th Presidential Inaugural Committee for venue rentals. A top inaugural planner emailed Ivanka and others at the company to \"express my concern\" that the hotel was overcharging for its event spaces, worrying of what would happen \"when this is audited.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nIf the Trump hotel charged more than the going rate for the venues, it could violate tax law. The inaugural committee's payments to the Trump Organization and Ivanka Trump's role have not been previously reported or disclosed in public filings.\n\n\"The fact that the inaugural committee did business with the Trump Organization raises huge ethical questions about the potential for undue enrichment,\" said Marcus Owens , the former head of the division of the Internal Revenue Service that oversees nonprofits.\n\nInaugural workers had other misgivings. Rick Gates, then the deputy to the chairman of the inaugural, asked some vendors to take payments directly from donors, rather than through the committee, according to two people with direct knowledge. The vendors felt the request was unusual and concerning, according to these people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they signed confidentiality agreements. It is not clear whether any vendors took him up on his request.\n\nThe revelations about the inauguration's finances show how Trump blurred the lines between his political and business lives, as the real estate mogul ascended to the presidency.\n\nOn Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported that federal prosecutors in New York have opened a criminal investigation into whether the inaugural committee misspent money and whether donors gave in return for political favors, citing people familiar with the matter. In addition, The New York Times reported that prosecutors are examining whether foreigners illegally funnelled money to the inauguration.\n\nPeter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Ivanka Trump's ethics lawyer, said: \"When contacted by someone working on the inauguration, Ms. Trump passed the inquiry on to a hotel official and said only that any resulting discussions should be at a 'fair market rate.' Ms. Trump was not involved in any additional discussions.\"\n\nMirijanian did not provide evidence that Ivanka Trump sought a fair market rate.\n\nA spokeswoman for the inaugural committee said it \"is not aware of any pending investigations and has not been contacted by any prosecutors. We simply have no evidence the investigation exists.\" The White House and a lawyer for Gates did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for the Manhattan federal prosecutors' office declined to comment. The Trump Organization did not comment.\n\n\"That doesn't have anything to do with the president or the first lady,\" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters on Thursday night, when asked about the story in the Journal.\n\nPresident-elect Trump was repeatedly briefed on inaugural planning and specific events, according to one committee worker with direct knowledge. WNYC and ProPublica have seen presentations that were shown to the president-elect, complete with renderings and floor plans.\n\nTrump's 2017 inauguration committee, which was chaired by his friend the businessman Tom Barrack, raised nearly $107 million from donors including the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and AT&T. The January 2017 festivities cost almost twice President Obama's 2009 inauguration, previously the most expensive. The nonprofit that planned Trump's inauguration booked many spaces in the Trump International Hotel, located in the Old Post Office building near the White House, including a ballroom, hotel rooms and work spaces, as well as paying for meals there, according to several people who worked on the inauguration.\n\nHow the inaugural committee managed to spend all the money it raised remains a mystery, nearly two years after the event. While groups that support political candidates or issues must publicly detail their spending, an inaugural committee is required to list only its top five contractors. That leaves about $40 million unaccounted for.\n\nGreg Jenkins, who led George W. Bush's second inauguration, was perplexed by the Trump team's mammoth fundraising haul. \"They had a third of the staff and a quarter of the events and they raise at least twice as much as we did,\" Jenkins told WNYC and ProPublica this year. \"So there's the obvious question: Where did it go? I don't know.\"\n\nAs planning for the inauguration was underway in December 2016, Ivanka Trump was still an executive vice president at the Trump Organization. But she was reportedly preparing to move to Washington and take on a greater public role. She now serves as an adviser to the president.\n\nAround the middle of the month, with Inauguration Day scarcely a month away, Ivanka Trump was asked to help resolve a dispute between inaugural planners and her family's Washington hotel, according to emails.\n\nThe problem: Organizers thought the hotel was charging too much money.\n\nEmails show that Ivanka Trump connected Gates with Mickael Damelincourt, managing director of the hotel. Damelincourt responded with a new rate of $175,000 per day for use of the Presidential Ballroom and meeting rooms, offering a $700,000 charge for four days of use.\n\nIt is not clear what the earlier price was, but Damelincourt's revised rate did not satisfy one of the lead organizers of the inauguration, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff.\n\nIn an email to Ivanka Trump and Gates, Wolkoff, who had previously managed the Metropolitan Museum's annual gala and fashion shows at Lincoln Center, expressed discomfort with the price.\n\n\"I wanted to follow up on our conversation and express my concern,\" Wolkoff wrote in the December email.\n\n\"These events are in PE's [the president-elect's] honor at his hotel and one of them is for family and close friends. Please take into consideration that when this is audited it will become public knowledge,\" she wrote, noting that other locations would be provided to the inaugural committee for free.\n\n\"I understand that compared to the original pricing this is great but we should look at the whole context,\" Wolkoff wrote, suggesting a day rate of $85,000, less than half of the Trump hotel's offer.\n\nA former Trump hotel staffer confirmed that the inaugural committee paid for inaugural week events at the hotel. It's not clear what price the committee ultimately paid. Previous media coverage has focused on spending by outside groups at the Trump hotel but it was not known that the official inaugural committee itself spent significant sums there.\n\nWolkoff also raised concerns about spending in a conversation with then-Trump attorney Michael Cohen, according to the story in the Journal. Federal prosecutors have a recording of that conversation, according to the Journal. The Times story suggests that conversation took place well after the inauguration.\n\nWolkoff, who is a friend of first lady Melania Trump, did not respond to a request for comment. Wolkoff's firm, WIS Media Partners, was the inauguration's highest-paid contractor, according to the committee's tax filing . Wolkoff was scrutinized in media accounts this year because the firm received nearly $26 million. Most of the money was passed on to subcontractors, according to a person familiar with the spending. It is possible that payments to the Trump hotel were included in that sum.\n\nIf the Trump hotel charged the inaugural committee above-market rates, it could violate tax rules, according to Owens, the nonprofit tax expert who is now a partner at the law firm Loeb & Loeb.\n\nIf a person with \"substantial influence\" over a nonprofit group charges the group above-market rates in a transaction with their outside business, the IRS can impose steep fines. In this case, Donald Trump could qualify as a person with such influence. Should the tax agency find that a violation occurred, the Trump Organization would have to refund any overcharge and the inaugural committee would be hit with a 25 percent tax on the money, Owens said.\n\nOwens added that IRS audits of nonprofits are increasingly rare. Since the inaugural committee was incorporated in Virginia, the state attorney general there could also have standing to investigate its operations.\n\nA spokeswoman for the inaugural committee said its finances \"were fully audited internally and independently and are fully accounted. ... These were funds raised from private individuals and were then spent in accordance with the law and the expectations of the donors.\"\n\nThe inaugural committee spent money at the Trump International in Washington in other ways as well. Many workers came from California and New York and stayed at the hotel, eating their meals there and holding meetings. Receipts reviewed by WNYC and ProPublica show they typically paid about $350 a night. According to an inaugural worker, 15 to 20 inaugural workers stayed at the hotel most nights for roughly a month in the run-up to the inauguration, at a total cost of what could be more than $200,000.\n\nThe professional resumes of top Trump hotel staffers indicate they worked closely with the presidential inaugural committee. The hotel's director of food and beverage says on his LinkedIn profile that he was \"working with PIC [Presidential Inaugural Committee] during the 2017 Inauguration\" and a \"related series of very special events.\"\n\nThe day before Trump's swearing in, the inaugural committee hosted a Leadership Luncheon in the hotel's Presidential Ballroom, featuring his cabinet nominees and major donors. \"This is a gorgeous room,\" the president-elect told the crowd. \"A total genius must have built this place.\" And the night of the inauguration itself, Trump's family and close allies such as Sean Hannity celebrated into the early morning at an exclusive after-party in the Trump hotel's grand lobby. Thousands of red, white and blue balloons were released from the rafters.\n\nSome vendors for the inauguration became concerned when Gates, a top inaugural committee official, asked them to take payments outside of the normal committee invoicing process, according to two people with knowledge of what happened. He proposed that they be paid for their work directly from a would-be donor rather than by the committee. Gates told the vendors that the inaugural committee had received pledges of more money than was initially targeted, and, therefore, he wished to reduce the publicly reported sum raised.\n\nIn 2019, ProPublica revealed stark inconsistencies between what the Trump Organization had reported to tax authorities and what it told lenders about the finances of one of its towers. A judge this week ruled the company had committed fraud.\n\nGates did not respond to a request for comment. Last February, he pleaded guilty to unrelated charges of lying to the FBI and conspiracy, as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry.\n\nOver the summer, Gates was cross examined about his work for the inauguration in the trial of his former boss, Paul Manafort. Gates conceded that he might have charged personal expenses to the committee. \"It's possible,\" he said.\n\nIn a separate episode this year, a U.S. lobbyist pleaded guilty to helping a Ukrainian businessman and member of Parliament buy tickets to the inauguration, in violation of rules barring the committee from taking foreign money. The inaugural committee was not accused of wrongdoing in that case.\n\nDo you have information about Trump's inaugural or the Trump Organization?

      "text": "The Trump Administration Used Its Food Aid Program for Political Gain, Congressional Investigators Find\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nA $6 billion federal program created to provide fresh produce to families affected by the pandemic was mismanaged and used by the Trump administration for political gain, a new congressional report has found.\n\nAs a ProPublica investigation revealed last spring and as the new report further details, the Farmers to Families Food Box program gave contracts to companies that had no relevant experience and often lacked necessary licenses. The House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, which released its report last week, found that former President Donald Trump's administration did not adequately screen contractor applications or identify red flags in bid proposals.\n\nOne company that received a $39 million contract was CRE8AD8 LLC (pronounced \"Create a Date\"), a wedding and event planning firm. The owner compared the contract to his usual work of \"putting tchotchkes in a bag.\"\n\nIn response to the report, the firm's CEO said in a statement, \"We delivered far more boxes/pounds than many other contractors and as a for-profit company, we're allowed to make a profit.\"\n\nThe congressional report also highlighted the application of an avocado grower who was initially awarded a $40 million contract before it was canceled after a review. Under the section of the application that required applicants to list references, the farmer wrote, \"I don't have any.\"\n\nThe Food to Families program was created by the Department of Agriculture in the early days of the pandemic to give away produce that might have otherwise gone to waste as a result of disruptions in distribution chains. The boxes included produce, milk, dairy and cooked meats - and many also included a signed letter from then-President Trump .\n\nThe program was unveiled in May 2020 by Ivanka Trump. \"I'm not shy about asking people to step up to the plate,\" the president's older daughter said in an interview to promote the initiative .\n\nAccording to congressional investigators, Ivanka Trump was involved in getting the letter from her father added to the boxes. The USDA told contractors that including the letter was mandatory. Food bank operators told the investigators the letter concerned them because it didn't appear to be politically neutral.\n\nOn the first day of the Republican National Convention in August 2020, President Trump and his daughter headlined a nearby event to announce an additional $1 billion for the food box program. Then-Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue also spoke at the event and encouraged attendees to reelect the president.\n\nA federal ethics office later found that Perdue's speech violated a federal law that prohibits officials from using their office for campaign purposes. The USDA at the time disputed the notion that Perdue was electioneering, saying that Perdue's comments merely \"predicted future behavior based on the president's focus on helping 'forgotten people.'\"\n\nThe yearlong congressional investigation also identified problems with the deliveries themselves, including food safety issues, failed deliveries and uneven food distribution. Some contractors also forced recipient organizations to accept more food than they could distribute or store.\n\nCommittee chair Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C. , said in a statement that the mismanagement of the program is another example of the previous administration's failures.\n\nRead More\n\n\"The Program was marred by a structure that prioritized industry over families, by contracting practices that prioritized cutting corners over competence, and by decisions that prioritized politics over the public good,\" he said.\n\nProPublica also found that the Trump administration hired a lobbyist to counter the criticism that contracts were going to unqualified contractors.\n\nPresident Joe Biden ended the program in May.\n\nRepresentatives of the former president did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFiled under -\n\nBianca Fortis was an Abrams Reporting Fellow at ProPublica.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\nSeries: Coronavirus\n\nContractors with no experience in food distribution are looking for suppliers on Facebook while some food banks scramble to find desperately needed deliveries.\n\nby Isaac Arnsdorf\n\nThe U.S. Response to COVID-19\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nA food relief program championed by President Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka is relying on some contractors who lack food distribution experience and aren't licensed to deal in fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\nThe contractors on Friday began delivering boxes containing fresh produce to food banks and other nonprofits. Forty-nine out of the 159 contractors picked by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to deliver boxes containing produce don't have a requisite license from the same agency, according to a search of the USDA's database using the information released about the contractors.\n\nSome of the contractors are established companies, and many food banks told ProPublica they're successfully and gratefully receiving shipments. But other contractors have eclectic backgrounds with little track record in food distribution, such as a wedding planner, a caterer and a \"brand builder.\"\n\nAs a result, some food banks are left scrambling for shipments or even callbacks.\n\n\"We thought this would work very well, and we really needed the food due to rising unemployment and business closings,\" said Pamela Irvine, CEO of Feeding America Southwest Virginia, which serves the poorest and most rural counties in that state. The USDA, she said, \"had money and wanted to respond quickly, which they should have because you saw all this produce grounded and milk being dumped. However, they didn't think about how that product should end up on a table somewhere and didn't communicate and didn't have a process in place for bidders to understand.\"\n\nAre you a public health worker or front-line medical provider? Do you work for or with a government agency involved in the effort to protect the public? Have you or your family personally been affected? Show us what we should be covering or serve as an expert to make sure we're on track.\n\nNote: If you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19, such as difficulty breathing or bluish lips, get medical attention immediately. The CDC has more information on what to do if you are sick.\n\nThe awards to firms for which no licenses could be found amount to $105.3 million, about 15% of the total for produce boxes. The USDA also hired contractors for boxes containing meat and dairy, at a total cost of $1.2 billion for six weeks, with the possibility of extending.\n\nThe licenses under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, or PACA, are required for wholesalers, processors, truckers, food-service firms and anyone else who buys or sells more than 2,000 pounds of fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables a day, according to the USDA's website.\n\n\"Much like you need a driver's license to operate a vehicle, the law requires that you have a PACA license to operate a produce business,\" the agency's website says. \"A PACA license is proof to your customers and suppliers that you are a serious business person who can be trusted to honor the terms of your contracts.\"\n\nThe licenses give vendors a way to resolve payment disputes, and many producers won't sell to someone who isn't licensed.\n\n\"We don't do business with people without a PACA license,\" said Noah Murguia, the CEO of Murguia Fruit, an orange wholesaler in California. Murguia said he is selling oranges to licensed contractors in the program but doesn't understand why anyone without a license would be allowed to participate. \"To me, it's a big joke,\" he said.\n\nThe USDA's official solicitation and application form don't mention PACA licenses. An agency spokesman said contractors that don't already have one will need to get one.\n\n\"All proposals were carefully reviewed by a team of contracting and technical experts and contracts made accordingly,\" the USDA said in a statement. Companies will have to submit documentation showing deliveries that meet the contract requirements in order to be paid, the agency said.\n\nTrump heralded the program in a tweet on May 9, saying it was implemented at his personal direction.\n\nStarting early next week, at my order, the USA will be purchasing, from our Farmers, Ranchers & Specialty Crop Growers, 3 Billion Dollars worth of Dairy, Meat & Produce for Food Lines & Kitchens. \"FARMERS TO FAMILY FOOD BOX\" Great news for all! @SecretarySonny @ZippyDuvall\n\nIvanka Trump also claimed credit for the initiative, telling USA Today, \"I'm not shy about asking people to step up to the plate. The whole country needs to be galvanized in the effort, both to combat this deadly virus, but also to rebuild ... to rebuild our economy as we emerge.\"\n\nSpeaking at a kick-off event in Maryland last week, Ivanka Trump addressed the awards to small operators, saying, \"We want to encourage and support a robust ecosystem of distributors across the nation.\"\n\nThe White House referred questions to the USDA.\n\nThe USDA has a long-established program that buys and distributes food to schools, food banks and households, totaling 3.3 billion pounds and $3.5 billion in 2019. Vendors have to be preapproved and meet precise specifications.\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nWith millions more Americans struggling to buy food as the coronavirus pandemic shutters businesses, USDA officials decided they needed to be more flexible about vendors, products and quantities. \"The development of the Farmers to Families Food Box Program represents a completely different way of doing business for us,\" Chris Purdy, associate deputy administrator of the USDA's commodity procurement program, said in an online seminar for applicants. \"But these times call for activities outside of our comfort zone.\"\n\nWhen the program was announced, the nonprofit organization Feeding America surveyed its nationwide network of 200 food banks about their needs and worked with seven national distributors on how to implement the program. But none of those distributors received contracts.\n\nIrvine's organization, in southwest Virginia, committed to taking 3.3 million pounds of produce, 2 million pounds of meat and 2.5 million pounds of dairy over six months. So far, her team has only secured 480,000 pounds of produce, 25,000 pounds of meat and no dairy after five days of cold-calling distributors who won contracts. Out of nine distributors contacted, three never responded and two didn't know what the program was, Irvine said.\n\n\"This is just going to blow your mind, it makes no sense,\" Irvine said: The only distributor who would ship them produce is sending it cross-country from Washington state.\n\n\"We actually think he called us by mistake,\" Bob Frampton, Feeding America Southwest Virginia's chief operations officer, said. \"But he's been great to work with, and we took what we could get because we're not crazy.\"\n\nHere's the dismal equation for food banks: Panic shopping and hoarding have led to supply shortages. Volunteers frightened of the virus have stopped showing up. And a newly jobless population has sent demand soaring.\n\nIt's not clear why some offbeat bids were successful. Federal contracts are heavily regulated, but the labyrinthine rules and procedures sometimes lead to curious outcomes. Businesses owned by minorities or veterans routinely have a leg up. The USDA spokesman said the agency looked for contractors who would \"support local and regional farmers.\"\n\nThe contracts also moved much faster than normal. Companies had only a week to submit bids, and the USDA announced winners just a week later.\n\nRejected applicants received a form letter saying \"some of the most common factors\" for losing were missing signatures, according to a copy of the letter obtained by ProPublica.\n\nOn a conference call a few days after the contracts were awarded, the USDA told winning bidders that they would need to apply for a PACA license if they didn't already have one, according to Stephen Martin of Blueprint Foods (identified on the USDA's announcement as SMH2 Manufacturing, receiving $1 million). \"We never knew about a PACA license until they brought it up on a conference call,\" Martin, whose company typically delivers prepared foods to grocery stores, said in an interview. \"What they're asking us to do is a fairly simple thing, like what we do anyway, except usually we cook things, so it's actually easier.\"\n\nStill, there are challenges for companies like Martin's that are working on their first government contract. \"We still have to go over how to invoice,\" Martin said. \"The notion that they built the plane in the air is accurate.\"\n\nSome \"upstanding companies\" that have experience with government contracts were denied \"on mistaken grounds,\" while winning bidders who don't have their own warehouses, staff and distributions channels are now looking for subcontractors, according to Tom Stenzel, CEO of the United Fresh Produce Association. \"This is not 'sour grapes' from those that may not have been awarded; this is a genuine effort to ensure integrity and confidence in the program and that fresh produce actually gets to those in need in an efficient and cost-effective way,\" Stenzel said in a letter to USDA leaders.\n\nThree companies that received a total of $6 million in contracts are licensed but are involved in business disputes that were reported to the USDA, according to the agency's public data. Doug Peterson, the CEO of Aggrigator, which received a contract for $2.6 million, said the company is trying to resolve its five disputes and the complaints never came up in the bidding process. Peterson said the company is producing 4,000 boxes a day and started deliveries on Saturday.\n\nA California avocado grower named Ben Holtz received a contract for $40 million, more than any other company without a PACA license. Holtz posted on Facebook, \"Looking to buy Truckloads of: USDA Carrots, USA Cucumber, USA Apples, USA Sweet Potatoes, USA Onions, USA Green Bell Peppers, USA Pears, USA Tomatoes. If your Farm or Shed or Packing Operation wants orders, PM me.\"\n\nOne commenter asked Holtz if his company is in the Produce Blue Book, an industry-standard business directory that rates the creditworthiness of produce suppliers. Without that assurance, the commenter wanted to know if Holtz would be paying cash upfront.\n\nHoltz replied, \"Huh?\"\n\nHoltz has since made a website and said he has more than 10,000 orders. In a phone interview, he said he's already delivered more than 2,200 boxes and has thousands more on the way.\n\n\"This isn't foreign to me,\" Holtz said in a phone interview. \"I have lots of experience running jobs, this is just a job. I'm a fourth-generation avocado grower, I can talk produce. I know how things get to where they need to be. I know how to run jobs with manpower and people with limits and constraints and financing. It's going to take everything and everybody I've ever known to pull this off, and we're doing it. We're off to the races.\"\n\nHoltz was surprised to win a contract at the top of the range he applied for, for up to 1 million boxes. \"Getting up to seven digits was just kind of cool-looking,\" he said. \"I put it down and they said all right.\"\n\nHoltz doesn't have a PACA license but said he has applied for one and asked the USDA to expedite it. Holtz's lack of a license and absence from the Produce Blue Book have made some vendors wary of him, Holtz said, but he said he relies on industry contacts or pays cash. \"If you want to know anything about me and my reputation, call up anyone in the California avocado world and they will know my name,\" he said.\n\nThe USDA awarded a $39.1 million contract, including $6.25 million for produce, to CRE8AD8 LLC (pronounced \"Create a Date\"), a wedding and event planner in San Antonio. \"We had no idea we'd be asked to help on this level,\" CEO Gregorio Palomino said in a Facebook post . He does not have a PACA license and said he applied last week.\n\nPalomino told the San Antonio Express-News that the job isn't that different from his usual work. \"We knew that we easily could do this because instead of putting tchotchkes in a bag that is going to go to a conference attendee, this is the same exact thing except it's just food going into a box,\" he told the newspaper.\n\nIn a statement, Palomino said he's in an \"initial planning phase,\" and his next steps will be hiring up to 100 people and assigning roles and tasks. \"This is the largest contract we have won to date,\" he said in a statement. \"This award will help us all rebound from our losses due to Covid-19.\"\n\nA $12.2 million contract went to Travel Well Holdings, a California company with no website. According to the LinkedIn profile of founder Desiree Rodriguez, the company \"provides a curated line of travel essentials to surprise and delight travelers with unexpected yet much needed items to improve their personal journey.\"\n\nRodriguez, whose profile describes her as a \"Business Development Strategist, Entrepreneur, Brand Builder,\" declined to comment.\n\nBeena Raghavendran contributed reporting.\n\nAre you a public health worker or front-line medical provider?

      "text": "Read Ivanka Trump's Speech at the Republican Convention\n\nI vanka Trump introduced her father at the Republican national convention Thursday, arguing that he is \"color blind and gender neutral\" and arguing he would fight for women's issues.\n\n\"As President, my father will change the labor laws that were put into place at a time when women were not a significant portion of the workforce,\" she said. \"And he will focus on making quality childcare affordable and accessible for all.\"\n\nRead Ivanka's remarks as delivered below:\n\nGood evening. Thank you. One year ago, I introduced my father when he declared his candidacy. In his own way, and through his own sheer force of will, he sacrificed greatly to enter the political arena as an outsider.\n\nAnd he prevailed against a field of 16 very talented competitors.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nFor more than a year, Donald Trump has been the people's champion, and tonight he's the people's nominee.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nLike many of my fellow millenials, I do not consider myself categorically Republican or Democrat. More than party affiliation, I vote on based on what I believe is right, for my family and for my country. Sometimes it's a tough choice. That is not the case this time. As the proud daughter of your nominee, I am here to tell you that this is the moment and Donald Trump is the person to make America great again.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nReal change, the kind we have not seen in decades is only going to come from outside the system. And it's only going to come from a man who's spent his entire life doing what others said could not be done. My father is a fighter. When the primaries got tough and they were tough, he did what any great leader does. He dug deeper, worked harder, got better and became stronger.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI have seen him fight for his family. I have seen him fight for his employees. I have seen him fight for his company. And now, I am seeing him fight for our country. It's been the story of his life and more recently the spirit of his campaign. It's also a prelude to reaching the goal that unites us all. When this party and better still this country knows what it is like to win again.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIf it's possible to be famous and yet not really well done, that describes the father who raised me. In the same office in Trump Tower, where we now work together, I remember playing on the floor by my father's desk, constructing miniature buildings with Legos and Erector sets, while he did the same with concrete steel and glass.\n\nMy father taught my siblings and me the importance of positive values and a strong ethical compass. He showed us how to be resilient, how to deal with challenges and how to strive for excellence in all that we do. He taught us that there's nothing that we cannot accomplish, if we marry vision and passion with an enduring work ethic.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOne of my father's greatest talents is the ability to see potential in people, before they see it in themselves. It was like that for us to growing up. He taught us that potential vanishes into nothing without effort.\n\nAnd like him, we each had a responsibility to work, not just for ourselves but for the betterment of the world around us. Over the years, on too many occasions to count, I saw my father tear stories out of the newspaper about people whom he had never met, who were facing some injustice or hardship.\n\nHe'd write a note to his assistant, in a signature black felt tip pen, and request that the person be found and invited to Trump Tower to meet with him. He would talk to them and then draw upon his extensive network to find them a job or get them a break. And they would leave his office, as people so often do after having been with Donald Trump, feeling that life could be great again.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThroughout my entire life, I have witnessed his empathy and generosity towards other, especially those who are suffering. It is just his way of being in your corner when you're down. My father not only has the strength and ability necessary to be our next President, but also the kindness and compassion that will enable him to be the leader that this country needs.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMy father has a sense of fairness that touches every conviction he's hold. I worked along side of him for now more than a decade now at the Trump Organization and I've seen how he operates as a leader. Making important decisions that shape careers and that change lives.\n\nI've learned a lot about the world from walking construction jobs by his side. When run properly, construction sites are true meritocracies. Competence in the building trades is easy to spot and incompetence is impossible to hide.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThese sites are also incredible melting pots, gathering people from all walks of life and uniting them to work towards a single mission. There have always been men of all background and ethnicities on my father's job sites. And long before it was common place, you also saw women.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMy father values talent. He recognizes real knowledge and skill when he finds it. He is color blind and gender neutral. He hires the best person for the job, period.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWords and promises, no matter visionary they sound will only get you so far. In our business, you're not a builder, unless you've got a building to show for it, or in my father's case, city skylines. Most people strive their entire lives to achieve great success in a single industry.\n\nMy father has succeeded in many on the highest level and on a global scale. One of the reasons he has thrived as an entrepreneur is because he listens to everyone. Billionaire executives don't usually ask the people doing the work for their opinion of the work. My father is an exception.\n\nTRUMP: On every one of his projects, you'll see him talking to the super, the painter, the engineers, the electricians, he'll ask them for their feedback, if they think something should be done differently, or could be done better. When Donald Trump is in charge, all that counts is ability, effort and excellence.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThis has long been the philosophy at the Trump Organization. At my father's company, there are more female than male executives. Women are paid equally for the work that we do and when a woman becomes a mother, she is supported, not shut out.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWomen represent 46 percent of the total U.S. labor force, and 40 percent of American households have female primary breadwinners. In 2014, women made 83 cents for every dollar made by a man. Single women without children earn 94 cents for each dollar earned by a man, whereas married mothers made only 77 cents. As researchers have noted, gender is no longer the factor creating the greatest wage discrepancy in this country, motherhood is.\n\nAs President, my father will change the labor laws that were put into place at a time when women were not a significant portion of the workforce. And he will focus on making quality childcare affordable and accessible for all.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAs a mother myself, of three young children, I know how hard it is to work while raising a family. And I also know that I'm far more fortunate than most. American families need relief. Policies that allow women with children to thrive should not be novelties, they should be the norm. Politicians talk about wage equality, but my father has made it a practice at his company throughout his entire career.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHe will fight for equal pay for equal work, and I will fight for this too, right along side of him.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAmericans today need an economy that permits people to rise again. A Trump Presidency will turn the economy around and restore the great American tradition of giving each new generation hope for brighter opportunities than those of the generation that came before. In Donald Trump, you have a candidate who knows the difference between wanting something done and making it happen.\n\nWhen my father says that he will build a tower, keep an eye on the skyline. Floor by floor a soaring structure will appear, usually record setting in its height and iconic in its design.\n\nReal people are hired to do real work. Vision becomes reality. When my father says that he will make America great again, he will deliver.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe have a chance this year, to reclaim our heritage as a country that dreams big and makes the impossible happen. Fortunately, Donald Trump is incapable of thinking small. When I was a child, my father always told me, Ivanka if you're going to be thinking anyway, you might as well think big. As President, my father will take on the bold and worthy fights. He will be unafraid to set lofty goals and he will be relentless in his determination to achieve them.\n\nTo people all over America, I say, when you have my father in your corner, you will never again have to worry about being let down. He will fight for you all the time, all the way, every time.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMaybe it's the developer in him, but Donald Trump cannot stand to see empty main streets and boarded up factories. He can't bear the injustice of college graduates who are crippled by student debt, and mothers who can't afford of the childcare required to return to work to better the lives of their families. Other politicians see these hardships, see the unfairness of it all, and they say I feel for you. Only my father will say, I'll fight for you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThe hard working men and women of this country identify with my father. He is tough and he is persevering. He is honest and he is real. He's an optimist and he's a relentless believer in America and all of her potential. He loves his family and he loves his country with his heart and his soul.\n\nPoliticians ask to be judged by their promises, not their results. I ask you to judge my father by his results. Judge his values by those he's instilled in his children. Judge his competency by the towers he's built, the companies he's founded, and the tens of thousands of jobs he's created.\n\nHe is the single most qualified serve as chief executive of an $18 trillion economy. My father will call upon the best and brightest people from all spheres of industry and both side of the aisle. A new set of thinkers, to face our countries existing and future problems with fresh perspective and brave new solutions. Come January 17, all things will be possible again. We can hope and dream and think big again. No one has more faith in the American people than my father. He will be your greatest, your truest and your most loyal champion.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThis is the fighter, the doer that you have chosen as your nominee, in ways no one expected, this moment in the life of our country has defined a mission and given it to an extraordinary man.\n\nHe is ready to see it all the way through, to speak to every man and every woman, of every background, in every part of this great country. To earn your trust and to earn your vote.\n\nHe earned that and much more from me a long time ago. I've loved and respected him, my entire life. And I could not be more proud tonight, to present to you and to all of America, my father and our next President, Donald J. Trump.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

A businesswoman and recurrent representative of President Donald Trump's administration, the commander-in-chief's daughter will not only play a prominent role at the conference as a speaker but also seeks to cement her status as a role model for female business owners and entrepreneurs around the world. Here's what to know:\n\nTrump is leading the American delegation to the eighth Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES) in Hyderabad, where from Nov. 28 to 30 more than 1,500 business-owners, investors, educators, and government officials will network and participate in panels and workshops. Previous conferences have been held in Washington D.C., Silicon Valley, Istanbul, Dubai, Marrakesh, Nairobi and Kuala Lumpur.\n\nAfter delivering a keynote address at the inauguration of the three-day conference, Trump will also participate in two panel discussions . She has previously represented the U.S. at global forums, including at the W-20 summit in Germany in April, which focused on promoting equal gender workforce participation. She also championed a new $325 million World Bank loan program aimed at supporting female entrepreneurs in developing countries that launched in July.\n\nTrump's attendance is also a statement of support to India from an American administration that has prioritized personal relations with world leaders. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who will open the GES and host a gala dinner, told President Trump that he looked forward to \" showcasing innovation and collaboration between India and the United States\" last week, Reuters reported.\n\nUpon Trump's arrival in Hyderabad, a centuries-old capital that has evolved into a regional technology hub, she will see a city that worked hard to tidy up its image. Over the past few weeks, police have reportedly cleared out hundreds of beggars and rounded up street dogs, according to the Guardian , though officials have denied local media reports claiming that stray dogs had been euthanized. Authorities have also taken more cosmetic efforts to beautify the city, scrubbing streets, fixing potholes and painting bridges in rainbow colors , the Guardian reports.\n\nHyderabad has used Trump's attendance to publicize the event, posting her likenesses on billboards along major roadways and installing mannequins of President Trump, his daughter and her husband Jared Kushner throughout the city. The \"Ivanka effect\" seems to have been a success: Organizers reportedly received 44,000 applications for 400 attendance slots designated for Indian firms, according to the Times of India.\n\nIvanka's role at the GES has also raised questions about her own clothing and lifestyle brand, which is exclusively manufactured in garment factories in lower-income countries including India, Bangladesh and China, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe company's reliance on overseas manufacturing clashes with President Trump's support for U.S. manufacturers as well as Ivanka's own #WomenWhoWork social media campaign and her latest book , which promotes professional empowerment and financial independence for women. Young, low-skilled women constitute the majority of India's garment sector, where they make about $4.60 to $4.70 per day , according to data from the Indian government and the Clean Clothes Campaign cited by the Post .\n\nA Post investigation also found that Trump's brand, which generated $100 million in retail revenue in 2016, failed to match up to industry standards of inspecting supply chains. Earlier this month, 23 labor, gender, and rights groups signed an open letter to Ivanka requesting that her brand disclose suppliers and open their facilities to independent monitors.\n\nWrite to Eli Meixler at eli.meixler@time.com"

      "text": "Why America's First Daughter Is a Hit In China\n\nB eijing's Parkview Green shopping mall is a towering wedge of steel and glass where China's young and ravishing gather to browse and be seen. Scores of international brands like Moschino, Stella McCartney and even Brompton foldable bikes-the hipster's favorite-fan out from an airy central atrium. Mellow hip-hop beats envelop lounging fashionistas who nurse Starbucks iced coffees while catching up with the latest live-streaming shows on iPads covered in stickers.\n\nOne brand is conspicuously missing from this carnival of chic. \"I really hope Ivanka Trump opens a shop in this mall,\" says Chen Shanshan, 32, wearing a black romper and gold-rimmed sunglasses as her young daughter swings on her arm demanding ice cream. \"I think Ivanka is a nice woman and very successful in her career. I'd check it out.\"\n\nTrump used to have an eponymous fine-jewelry store in Unit 23 on Parkview's LG1 floor, but that 78 sq m of prime retail space was taken over by a rival jeweler from Monaco two years ago. Trump's store launched in 2013 as the first of five slated for the \"greater China\" market, which also includes Hong Kong and Taiwan. At the time, Trump told the Wall Street Journal that the openings were one of her \"primary focuses going forward.\" A press release estimated that each new store would bring in minimum annual revenue of $3 million.\n\nNone of the other shops materialized, and the Parkview branch closed in 2015, a casualty of China's cutthroat luxury-goods market. Yet today Trump's brand is booming across the Middle Kingdom, whose swelling middle class hankers for the latest threads from New York, Paris and London. \"As the daughter of the U.S. President, Ivanka Trump has an initial advantage of publicity,\" says Yang Mei, 29, a designer for Beijing-based fashion studio Azrael YM.\n\nTrump's firm does not publish sales figures, but its fortunes trace her father's political rise. Company president Abigail Klem told TIME there was \"significant year-over-year revenue growth\" in an emailed statement. Annual revenue estimates of about $100 million were increased by $17.9 million for the year ending on Jan. 31, according to New York City-based G-III Apparel Group Ltd., which has the exclusive license to make Trump clothing. According to leading fashion web portal Lyst, global orders for Ivanka Trump products in February, a month after Donald Trump's Inauguration, were up 774%, compared with the same month the year before. In China, where Lyst has yet to open a dedicated site or offer a Chinese-language option, there was a doubling of orders and a 284% increase in searches for Ivanka Trump.\n\nChinese consumers typically order her brand via Taobao, the online marketplace owned by Jack Ma's Alibaba Group, which sells everything from incense sticks to pet miniature pigs. Alibaba does not provide sale or search figures, though a quick comb through the site shows no shortage of Trump merchandise. \"On average, we can sell 20 pairs of Ivanka Trump shoes a month,\" says a sales rep for just one Taobao clothing store, Miss_SS. \"Before [Donald] Trump became U.S. President, we didn't sell Ivanka's brand, but then people started asking for it.\"\n\nIvanka Trump's burgeoning profile in China spotlights how difficult it is to untangle her family's dizzying commercial interests from a White House that is itself run like a family firm. Trump, 35, and her husband, real estate scion Jared Kushner, 36, both hold official advisory positions in her father's Administration, underscoring the ethical tightrope the President's daughter must walk to maintain a business empire that reaches across the globe-one that grows ever stronger alongside her expanding political role.\n\nIn China, where Trump produces the bulk of her branded wares, she is not only ramping up sales but also, alongside Kushner, playing a key role as an interlocutor with Beijing. Donald Trump frequently railed against China at the stump, accusing its export-driven economy of stealing American jobs and vowing to impose 45% tariffs on imports and label it a currency manipulator. But the U.S. President has since tempered his rhetoric and even praised Chinese President Xi Jinping for working to rein in North Korean leader Kim Jong Un-though he has since tweeted that those efforts have \"not worked out.\"\n\nIvanka Trump and her husband are credited by China experts on both sides of the Pacific with engineering her father's thaw with Beijing. She has also played a role in increasing pressure on China's human-rights record, speaking at a June 27 event where Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announced that China had failed to take \"serious steps to end its own complicity\" in human trafficking.\n\nDonald Trump initially angered Xi by questioning Chinese sovereignty over independently governed Taiwan, which Beijing deems part of its \"core interests.\" It was only after the First Daughter helped clear the air with Cui Tiankai, the Chinese ambassador to the U.S., that the two leaders finally shared a phone call. Cui had invited the Kushners to a Chinese New Year embassy reception, where their Mandarin-speaking daughter Arabella, who is just shy of 6, charmed the crowd.\n\nThe intervention was imperative given that the U.S. President had broken protocol by not issuing a Chinese New Year's greeting on the first day of the auspicious holiday. Kushner then took the lead organizing a summit between the leaders of the world's two biggest economies at the U.S. President's Mar-a-Lago resort in April. \"Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner are very important to U.S.-China relations,\" says Zhan Jiang of Beijing Foreign Studies University. \"It's a Chinese mentality to value these family connections.\"\n\nFamily is a powerful diplomatic tool that Trump and Kushner wield in China, often in the shape of Arabella, who learned Mandarin from the crib thanks to a Chinese nanny. With her 3-year-old brother Joseph, she sung in Mandarin at Mar-a-Lago, yet she was already a social media star in China for her devastatingly cute renditions of traditional Chinese songs. The presidential performance has been viewed more than 2.2 million times on China's leading Internet TV site, qq.com. \"Chinese people like to worship idols, and Ivanka really triggered a fever in China,\" says Hu Xingdou, a professor of economics at the Beijing Institute of Technology. \"Plus, she is very friendly to Chinese people, so she has a lot of fans here.\"\n\nSocial media fan clubs hail her as \"a goddess,\" while state media have described her as having an \"elegant and poised style.\" (Chinese leaders may figure that, through Trump, they can more easily engage with her father.) She is particularly feted for her have-it-all feminism. In a land where everyone is seemingly an aspiring entrepreneur and self-help books crowd shelves, Trump's speeches are scrutinized for pointers on climbing the corporate ladder and staving off chauvinism in the office and at home. Many Chinese also see Confucian values in her decision to convert to Judaism for her husband and in her filial defense of her father, despite his latent misogyny. \"Ivanka is the perfect woman,\" says Zhang Hang, 32, who works for an IT company in Beijing. \"Ivanka knows how to balance career and family-that's what I should learn from her.\"\n\nBut Trump's business ties threaten to undermine the shrewdness of her diplomacy. On the same day that Xi and her father dined at Mar-a-Lago, Ivanka Trump's brand had three new trademarks approved in China for jewelry, leather handbags and spas. Those were in addition to 15 existing trademarks for cosmetics, luggage, clothes, shoes, retail and beauty services. More than 40 applications are still pending. There is no sign that that decision was rushed as a favor, and the Ivanka Trump brand insists that the trademarks are simply defensive to ward off counterfeiters, especially as \"trademark squatting\" is rampant in China. Owing to her newfound celebrity, hundreds of trademark applications under Trump's Chinese name-Yi Wan Ka-have been filed on myriad products and services. On June 14 the Chinese government granted preliminary approval for nine Donald Trump trademarks it had previously rejected. His lawyer said they, too, were defensive to stop unsanctioned businesses from using his name.\n\nThe White House has argued that there is no improper conflict of interest. \"Jared and Ivanka will fully abide by government ethics rules and will recuse when appropriate in consultation with the Office of White House Counsel,\" said one White House official. Klem, the president of Ivanka Trump's brand, told Congress in May that Trump has limited control of her business and must consult with an ethics adviser \"prior to certain actions,\" which were not specified.\n\nTrump's business model mirrors that of virtually all her competitors in the apparel industry: use low foreign wages and minimal import levies to maximize profits. That's precisely what her father railed against during his volcanic campaign, when he pledged to put \"America first\" and force U.S. companies to bring manufacturing jobs back home. Some of the 80 workers employed at one Chinese factory making blouses, dresses and other items under Trump's label were paid just over $60 for a 60-hour workweek, according to an outside audit published by the Fair Labor Association in April.\n\nAn investigation by New York City-based NGO China Labor Watch found dubious labor practices at factories producing Ivanka Trump shoes, including excessive overtime, low pay and the possible misuse of student interns. The case made global headlines in late May, when three CLW investigators were arrested by the authorities, only to be released on June 28 on bail after being detained for 30 days. The Ivanka Trump brand distanced itself from the factory in question, saying the shoes had not been made there since March.\n\nYet Trump and Kushner look likely to get more, not less, involved with China. On June 18 they hosted former Iowa governor Terry Branstad, the new U.S. ambassador to China, who has known Xi since the 1980s, at the Trump Hotel in Washington. Two days later, U.S. and other media reported that the Chinese government had extended a special invitation to Trump and Kushner to travel to Beijing in preparation for a presidential visit.\n\nCorrection: The original version of this story incorrectly described G-III Apparel Group Ltd. The company manufactures apparel under the Ivanka Trump license, but it does not make Ivanka Trump shoes and was not involved with the brand's trademark applications.\n\nWrite to Charlie Campbell / Beijing at charlie.campbell@time.com"

      "text": "Jared Kushner Used Encrypted App to Communicate With Foreign Leaders, Democrats Claim\n\nH ouse Democrats claim that President Donald Trump's son-in-law used an encrypted messenger app for official White House business in what would be a serious breach of records laws.\n\nHouse Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings sent a letter to White House Counsel Pat Cipollone informing him that he had learned from Kushner's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, that Jared Kushner has used WhatsApp for official work, including with some foreign officials.\n\nAccording to Cummings, Lowell \"could not answer\" questions about whether those communications included classified information, which would be a serious breach of security protocol.\n\nIn addition, the Maryland Democrat said that had also learned from Lowell that Ivanka Trump is still receiving work-related emails on her personal email account that she does not forward to her official White House account.\n\nIf true, the claims would raise questions about the White House's handling of online security and classified information, the very same charges that Trump successfully used against Hillary Clinton over her private email server in the 2016 election.\n\nOn Thursday, Lowell sent an email to Cummings denying that he ever told the chairman Kushner had ever communicated with foreign officials, and that he had followed the proper protocol for classified information. He also denied that he told the committee that Ivanka Trump does not forward relevant personal emails.\n\nThe committee also said it obtained documents showing former top White House strategist Steve Bannon and former Deputy National Security Adviser K.T. McFarland had used their personal email accounts for White House business regarding the transfer of nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia.\n\nCummings requested documentation into the use of email by March 28. But, judging by the precedent that has been set by the White House, he is unlikely to receive it. As he himself noted in Thursday's letter, the initial deadline of January 11 for these documents came and went.\n\n\"As you know, the White House has not produced a single piece of paper to the committee in the 116th Congress - in this or any other investigation,\" Cummings wrote.\n\nThese actions, Cummings argued in his letter, are \"obstructing the Committee's investigation into allegations of violations of federal records laws by White House officials.\" The sentiments were a reiteration of the op-ed he had written in the Washington Post earlier in the week, where he described the White House as an operation \"engaged in an unprecedented level of stonewalling, delay and obstruction.\"\n\nBut, if Cummings needed any more ammunition to prove his point, he quickly got it. Separately on Thursday, Cipollone sent a reply to Cummings and two of his colleagues rejecting a request for documents on another matter: transcripts of the President's conversations with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. As he has before, Cipollone argued the request was an overreach beyond Congress' constitutional responsibility.\n\n\"While we respectfully seek to accommodate appropriate oversight requests, we are unaware of any precedent supporting such sweeping requests,\" he wrote in a letter to Cummings, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, and Committee on Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel. \"Rather, the Supreme Court and administrations of both parties have consistently recognized that the conduct of foreign affairs is a matter that the Constitution assigns exclusively to the President.\"\n\nIn a statement, the three lawmakers said the response \"continues a troubling pattern by the Trump Administration of rejecting legitimate and necessary congressional oversight with no regard for precedent or the constitution.\"\n\nThe back-and-forth exchanges have followed a fairly predictable pattern and foreshadow what could be the biggest showdown of all: the fight to see the entirety of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's findings. With speculation abuzz that Mueller could be wrapping up his probe, House Democrats have made clear they want to see nothing less than the full report - including the redacted parts.\n\nJurisdiction over that is squarely in the hands of Attorney General William Barr, rather than the White House Counsel's office. But under current regulations , Barr has no obligation to submit the report in full to Congress. The only thing Barr is required to tell Congress is when he declined to follow Mueller's recommendations, including for prosecution. Beyond that, he has broad discretion.\n\nThere is no telling what Barr may do. Republicans, including the President , have called for the report to be made public. But, if the White House Counsel's office responses this week are any indication of how he may respond, Democrats may want to gird for battle.\n\n-With reporting by Brian Bennett/Washington\n\nWrite to Alana Abramson at Alana.Abramson@time.com"

      "text": "Jared Kushner Used Encrypted App to Communicate With Foreign Leaders, Democrats Claim\n\nH ouse Democrats claim that President Donald Trump's son-in-law used an encrypted messenger app for official White House business in what would be a serious breach of records laws.\n\nHouse Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings sent a letter to White House Counsel Pat Cipollone informing him that he had learned from Kushner's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, that Jared Kushner has used WhatsApp for official work, including with some foreign officials.\n\nAccording to Cummings, Lowell \"could not answer\" questions about whether those communications included classified information, which would be a serious breach of security protocol.\n\nIn addition, the Maryland Democrat said that had also learned from Lowell that Ivanka Trump is still receiving work-related emails on her personal email account that she does not forward to her official White House account.\n\nIf true, the claims would raise questions about the White House's handling of online security and classified information, the very same charges that Trump successfully used against Hillary Clinton over her private email server in the 2016 election.\n\nOn Thursday, Lowell sent an email to Cummings denying that he ever told the chairman Kushner had ever communicated with foreign officials, and that he had followed the proper protocol for classified information. He also denied that he told the committee that Ivanka Trump does not forward relevant personal emails.\n\nThe committee also said it obtained documents showing former top White House strategist Steve Bannon and former Deputy National Security Adviser K.T. McFarland had used their personal email accounts for White House business regarding the transfer of nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia.\n\nCummings requested documentation into the use of email by March 28. But, judging by the precedent that has been set by the White House, he is unlikely to receive it. As he himself noted in Thursday's letter, the initial deadline of January 11 for these documents came and went.\n\n\"As you know, the White House has not produced a single piece of paper to the committee in the 116th Congress - in this or any other investigation,\" Cummings wrote.\n\nThese actions, Cummings argued in his letter, are \"obstructing the Committee's investigation into allegations of violations of federal records laws by White House officials.\" The sentiments were a reiteration of the op-ed he had written in the Washington Post earlier in the week, where he described the White House as an operation \"engaged in an unprecedented level of stonewalling, delay and obstruction.\"\n\nBut, if Cummings needed any more ammunition to prove his point, he quickly got it. Separately on Thursday, Cipollone sent a reply to Cummings and two of his colleagues rejecting a request for documents on another matter: transcripts of the President's conversations with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. As he has before, Cipollone argued the request was an overreach beyond Congress' constitutional responsibility.\n\n\"While we respectfully seek to accommodate appropriate oversight requests, we are unaware of any precedent supporting such sweeping requests,\" he wrote in a letter to Cummings, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, and Committee on Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel. \"Rather, the Supreme Court and administrations of both parties have consistently recognized that the conduct of foreign affairs is a matter that the Constitution assigns exclusively to the President.\"\n\nIn a statement, the three lawmakers said the response \"continues a troubling pattern by the Trump Administration of rejecting legitimate and necessary congressional oversight with no regard for precedent or the constitution.\"\n\nThe back-and-forth exchanges have followed a fairly predictable pattern and foreshadow what could be the biggest showdown of all: the fight to see the entirety of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's findings. With speculation abuzz that Mueller could be wrapping up his probe, House Democrats have made clear they want to see nothing less than the full report - including the redacted parts.\n\nJurisdiction over that is squarely in the hands of Attorney General William Barr, rather than the White House Counsel's office. But under current regulations , Barr has no obligation to submit the report in full to Congress. The only thing Barr is required to tell Congress is when he declined to follow Mueller's recommendations, including for prosecution. Beyond that, he has broad discretion.\n\nThere is no telling what Barr may do. Republicans, including the President , have called for the report to be made public. But, if the White House Counsel's office responses this week are any indication of how he may respond, Democrats may want to gird for battle.\n\n-With reporting by Brian Bennett/Washington\n\nWrite to Alana Abramson at Alana.Abramson@time.com"

      "text": "Ivanka Trump testimony: Why 'I don't recall' is a common legal strategy\n\nThe four hours of testimony from Ivanka Trump on Wednesday could almost be summarised in three words: \"I don't recall\".\n\nThe eldest daughter of former President Donald Trump became the fourth member of the family to take the stand in a civil fraud lawsuit brought by New York's attorney general, who has accused Mr Trump of inflating his net worth to obtain favourable loans from banks.\n\nThe approach of the three Trumps before her, Mr Trump and two of his sons, Donald Jr and Eric, ranged from bombastic to humorous to visibly agitated.\n\nBut Ms Trump, who unlike them is not a co-defendant, had a different persona on the stand.\n\nThe 42-year-old maintained a placid, tightly controlled demeanour even as the tempers of the lawyers and Judge Arthur Engoron began to flare. Unfailingly polite, she smiled brightly at the judge and other court officials, answering questions in a quiet and sometimes monotone voice.\n\nThis was a \"sharp contrast\" to that of her father earlier this week, said University of Richmond law professor Cal Tobias. \"She's not jousting with Judge Engoron or the attorney general's counsel, not making political statements, and is respectfully addressing the judge.\"\n\nWhile her style may have been different, there was one element of Ms Trump's testimony that overlapped with that of her brothers: she did not seem to remember much about the issues at hand.\n\nFor each question from prosecutor Lou Solomon aimed at whether Ms Trump had knowledge of her father's financial statements at the heart of this case, she replied mostly with a variation of \"I don't know\" and \"I don't remember\".\n\n\"Did you have any roles in preparing Donald J Trump's statements of financial condition?\" Mr Solomon asked.\n\n\"Not that I'm aware of,\" Ms Trump replied.\n\n\"Did you ever review any of Donald J Trump's statements of financial condition before they were finalised?\" the prosecutor asked.\n\n\"I don't recall,\" she said.\n\nThe strategy is common in business cases, where executives can argue that they handle a wide variety of issues and interact with many people daily, as well as put their name to a range of documents, said Eric Chaffee, an expert on white collar crime and a professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio.\n\n\"I think that the use of this defence is significant,\" Mr Chaffee said.\n\n\"It probably is a smart thing to do, legally,\" he added, as Ms Trump's repeated assertion of not recalling instances and documents could \"end up being truthful\", while at the same time helping protect both her reputation and help the defendants.\n\nAnd Ms Trump's approach is further helped by timing. Many of those instances and documents referred to in court were from ten or more years ago, meaning her lack of recall is entirely plausible.\n\nAt one point early in the questioning, she joked that she could not remember a call because it happened more than 12 years ago when she was nine months pregnant with her first child.\n\nExperts told the BBC the net effect of Ms Trump's testimony on the trial as a whole is likely to be negligible.\n\nTy Cobb, a lawyer who represented Mr Trump early in his presidency but has since spoken out against him, told the BBC he thought Ms Trump would have \"zero impact\" on the ultimate outcome.\n\n\"Her testimony has added not a single fact, as far as I can tell, other than she received one call while she was nine months pregnant,\" he said.\n\nIf anything, Mr Cobb said, her appearance on the stand - something she fought hard to avoid - may hurt the prosecution in the court of public opinion.\n\n\"I think it's a little bit of a dangerous decision by the attorney general, in the sense that it plays into the Trump theme of: this is just a political witch hunt,\" Mr Cobb said.\n\n\"Her being forced to testify, given the absence of any seemingly relevant testimony, sadly feeds into Mr Trump's fantasies,\" he said.\n\nMs Trump was the final person called to the stand by the attorney general's office. Next, the defence will be able to call their own witnesses.\n\nMr Trump, the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, has already been found liable for fraud along with his two sons. All have denied wrongdoing.\n\nThis trial will decide the penalties the defendants will face.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office filed the lawsuit, is seeking $250m (£204m) in fines and severe restrictions on how the Trump business operates in New York.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Ivanka Trump is pulled back into her father's orbit\n\nTwo weeks ago, Ivanka Trump was photographed striding into Kim Kardashian's birthday party in Beverly Hills.\n\nOn Wednesday, she walked into a Manhattan courthouse to testify in her father's business fraud trial.\n\nThe two settings presented a vivid split-screen of the lives of Ms Trump: the one she had before her father became president and to which she has attempted to return, and the thorny reality she now inhabits.\n\nMs Trump, 42, has spent the years since Donald Trump left the White House publicly distancing herself from her father's orbit. When he announced his new bid for the White House last year, she immediately made clear that she would not join the campaign.\n\n\"This time around, I am choosing to prioritise my young children and the private life we are creating as a family. I do not plan to be involved in politics.\"\n\nNow she finds herself dragged back into the family circus as the New York attorney general pursues a blockbuster civil fraud trial against her father, siblings, and their namesake business the Trump Organization.\n\nAnd while she did not take the stand as a defendant, the stakes for her personal and professional future could not have been higher.\n\nShe sought to distance herself as much as possible from her father's dealings, claiming in a muted monotone that she could \"not recall\" many aspects of the business with which she'd been intimately involved.\n\nBut the tactic might only go so far.\n\n\"There's no way that she walks out of this trial further distanced from the controversies surrounding her father,\" said Dan Alexander, a Forbes editor and author of White House, Inc.: How Donald Trump Turned the Presidency Into a Business.\n\n\"It's going to be an uncomfortable place for her, and I don't think that reputationally, it's the direction that she wants to go.\"\n\nIvanka Trump built her reputation as a socialite and businesswoman on her father's name.\n\nThe Trump brand once conferred wealth, glamour, and success. She appeared on the cover of teen magazines, fashion runways, and red carpets with Chelsea Clinton.\n\n\"Ivanka, like her father, is a master of self-promotion,\" said Mr Alexander, who has reported on the family's business dealings for years. \"What she was self-promoting was a different image than her father. Donald Trump is masculine, strong, and quote-unquote self made. Ivanka Trump is feminine and busy and family oriented, but professionally successful.\"\n\nIvanka Trump played a major role in developing some of her father's marquee properties, including the Doral golf course in Florida and the Old Post Office hotel in Washington DC that the Trumps redeveloped and owned until 2022.\n\nBut during Donald Trump's polarising presidency, her surname took on very different connotations.\n\nAfter serving as a top campaign surrogate, she joined his administration as a senior adviser. Political watchers had speculated that she would be a moderating voice in her father's ear. She advocated for policies like paid family leave and sentencing reform.\n\nAs the most famous Trump sibling, and the one closest to her father's administration, Ms Trump bore the most scrutiny. \"Her image changed,\" Mr Alexander said. \"People started to understand she wasn't quite exactly as she had made herself.\"\n\nThose people, New York's cultural and political elite, seemed at first unlikely to welcome her back to the world she once inhabited when Mr Trump left the White House.\n\nPre-presidency, Ms Trump once had her own eponymous clothing line. By 2017, Saturday Night Live was caricaturing Ms Trump in a mock advertisement for a perfume called \"Complicit.\"\n\nUltimately, her political work was overshadowed as the Trump administration was buffeted by scandals, infighting, impeachments, and, to cap it all off, a violent attempt by his supporters to stop his successor from taking office.\n\nMs Trump has kept a lower profile since the end of the administration.\n\nThough rumours occasionally fly that she will run for office, Ms Trump has stayed away from politics. She is not publicly involved in his 2024 campaign like her older brother, Donald Trump Jr, or the family business, like her younger brother Eric.\n\nShe and her husband, Jared Kushner, moved their family to an island neighbourhood near Miami, Florida that bears the nickname \"Billionaire's Bunker.\"\n\nMr Kushner was also a senior adviser to Mr Trump, working on Middle East policy. Like his wife, he has stepped away from politics. However he recently received $2bn for his private equity firm from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund.\n\nShe even seemed to be making inroads back into high society.\n\nIn late October, Ms Trump was photographed in a glittering white crop top and side-slit skirt arriving at Ms Kardashian's exclusive birthday party. The reality star posted a photo with Ms Trump and Lauren Sanchez - Jeff Bezos's partner - captioned: \"So blessed to have hit the jackpot of friends.\"\n\nIt was the sort of public celebrity embrace that Ms Trump frequently enjoyed in her youth, but had not seen since her father descended down a golden escalator in 2015 to announce his campaign for president.\n\nFor a moment, it seemed like Ms Trump's new life would once again come to resemble her old one.\n\nMs Trump fought hard to separate herself from her father's fraud case.\n\nShe retained her own attorney, and successfully petitioned to be dropped as a defendant after New York attorney general Letitia James named her in the suit. She tried to get out of testifying as a third-party witness, citing childcare concerns, but her appeal was denied.\n\nSo back to Manhattan she went, to sit before Judge Arthur Engoron and a room full of attorneys and reporters to answer pointed questions about the Trump Organization's financial practices.\n\nThough she could not evade testifying, her responses served to distance herself from the business practices at the company she once helped lead and the deals she helped broker.\n\nThe original suit claimed that Ms Trump was deeply involved with the Trump Organization's business, helping them secure real estate deals and loans at the heart of the case. Some of those deals, the attorney general alleges, were based on fraudulently inflated documents.\n\nHer brothers, Don Jr and Eric, had already testified. Both denied having in-depth knowledge of their father's financial statements or the company's accounting practices despite serving as executive vice-presidents of the organisation.\n\nMs Trump took a similar strategy, but while her brothers were respectively braggadocious and standoffish, her deflections took on a softer, more polished tone.\n\nUnder questioning, Ms Trump repeatedly stated she could \"not recall\" specific details of the loans Deutsche Bank gave her father for his projects, and she did \"not recall\" the emails she wrote or was copied on, involving said deals.\n\nAt one point, she gazed upon a document from over a decade ago, remarking on it as if it was from another lifetime.\n\n\"It's bringing back a lot of memories,\" she said.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Ivanka, Melania, a golf champion: Who was in Trump's huge victory entourage?\n\nHours after the polls closed, Donald Trump took the stage in Florida to declare victory, surrounding himself with a huge group of family, allies, campaign advisers - and sports figures.\n\nAll five of his children were there, some of whom played key roles in his last administration, alongside their four partners, and two of his 10 grandchildren.\n\nThere were also campaign advisers and political allies, both well-known and behind-the-scenes figures who were instrumental to Trump's campaigns in 2016, 2020 and 2024.\n\nAnd among the more unpredictable appearances were martial arts boss Dana White and pro-golfer Bryson DeChambeau.\n\nHere's what we know about the entourage that could offer some clues as to what we can expect from Trump's second administration.\n\nTrump's family have supported him politically and professionally for years - working in his real-estate business, rallying in his campaigns and even joining his previous administration from 2017 to 2021.\n\nBy his side was his wife Melania , who was largely absent from the campaign trail this election cycle.\n\nTrump hailed her for writing the \"number-one bestselling book in the country\" - a memoir in which she advocates for a woman's right to abortion , a stance at odds with many in the Republican Party.\n\nTrump was also joined by his youngest child, Barron Trump , 18, a first-year university student, and Melania's father Viktor Knavs , a Slovenian who became a US citizen in 2018.\n\nTrump's third child, Eric Trump , was joined by his wife Lara , who Trump appointed as co-chair of the Republican Party and who spoke at the Republican National Convention (RNC) this year.\n\nTrump's oldest son, Donald Trump Jr , a political adviser after Trump left the White House, was also there, joined by his fiancée Kimberly Guilfoyle . She was previously married to now-California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, and has given passionate speeches at the RNC.\n\nDonald Trump Jr also brought along two of his five children. His 17-year-old daughter Kai spoke publicly for the first time during the RNC, describing Trump as \"very caring and loving\" and \"a normal grandpa\".\n\nTrump's second child Ivanka Trump appeared with her husband Jared Kushner. Both held key roles under the Trump administration, with Kushner advising on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and relations with China, Mexico and Canada. The couple did not participate in this campaign.\n\nTrump's fourth child, Tiffany Trump , who has been less active in her father's political career but urged a rally this week to get out and vote, stood with her husband, Michael Boulos .\n\nVice-president-elect JD Vance , a senator from Ohio, hailed Trump's victory as the \"greatest political comeback\" in US history. Vance is also the author of the best-selling memoir Hillbilly Elegy, about his childhood in the white working-class Rust Belt.\n\n\"He turned out to be a good choice,\" Trump remarked. \"I took a little heat at the beginning, but I knew the brain was a good one - as good as it gets.\"\n\nVance celebrated with his wife Usha Vance . Born in California to Indian immigrants, she worked as a lawyer until her husband's campaign.\n\nKey members of Trump's campaign team and allies, including officials from his previous administration, savoured their victory on stage.\n\nThe line-up included campaign co-managers Susan Wiles and Chris LaCivita , RNC chair Michael Whatley , speechwriter Vince Haley , communications strategist Jason Miller , chief pollster Tony Fabrizio and senior adviser Dan Scavino .\n\nBest-known was senior adviser Stephen Miller , one of the architects of the 2017 travel ban that initially barred nationals of several Muslim-majority countries from the US.\n\nAlso present were adviser Boris Epshteyn , as well as former administrator of the US Small Business Administration Linda McMahon , who is the current chairwoman of the board at the America First Policy Institute.\n\nThey stood beside two elected officials: New York Representative Elise Stefanik and Louisiana Representative and House Speaker Mike Johnson , who was flanked by his wife Kelly Johnson .\n\nBillionaire businessman Howard Lutnick also appeared as chairman of the Trump transition team.\n\nWhile not on stage, billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk was referenced in Trump's speech, with the president-elect calling him an \"amazing guy\" and praising the recent successes of his space travel company SpaceX .\n\n\"That's why I love you, Elon,\" Trump said.\n\nThe CEO of Tesla has emerged as a key Trump supporter and recently came under fire for handing a million-dollar prize to some voters in swing states .\n\nDana White , boss of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), took to the podium to declare that \"nobody deserves this more\" than Trump and his family.\n\n\"Couldn't stop him, he keeps going forward, he doesn't quit, he's the most resilient, hard-working man I've ever met in my life,\" he said. White also thanked \"the mighty and powerful\" podcast host Joe Rogan, who endorsed Trump .\n\nTrump - a golf lover who faced an apparent attempt on his life at his Florida golf course two months ago - later pulled on-stage US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau .\n\nThe pair played a round of golf together over the summer for the golfer's YouTube channel.\n\nNorth America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice-weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

      "text": "Ivanka Trump testifies to New York fraud trial she cannot recall loan details\n\nIvanka Trump said she could not remember property deals she handled at her father's firm, as she testified in a civil fraud case that threatens his business empire.\n\nA judge has already found Donald Trump and two adult sons, Eric and Donald Jr, liable for fraud, ruling they inflated assets to secure favourable loans.\n\nIvanka Trump, 42, was initially a co-defendant, too, until an appeals court ruling in her favour this year.\n\nShe fought hard to avoid testifying.\n\nThe mother-of-three had argued she could not leave her children in Florida during a school week.\n\nBut a New York judge and appeals court ruled she must take the stand as a witness.\n\nThis is a non-jury trial, in which the judge will decide on allegations of falsifying business records, insurance fraud and conspiracy.\n\nMr Trump - the former US president and Republican frontrunner for next year's White House election - could be stripped of prized assets like Trump Tower. He and his sons deny wrongdoing.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office filed the lawsuit, is seeking $250m (£204m) in fines and severe restrictions on how the Trump business operates in the state.\n\nDuring four hours of testimony in the New York Supreme Court in lower Manhattan on Wednesday, Ms Trump spoke softly into the microphone, sitting upright with her hands in her lap, at times smiling brightly.\n\nIn composed and succinct responses, she repeatedly said she did not recall specifics, or was not aware.\n\nLike her two brothers in their testimony last week, Ms Trump distanced herself from documents central to the case - her father's financial statements, in which assets were allegedly inflated to secure better loan deals.\n\n\"I wasn't involved in his statement of financial condition,\" Ms Trump said. \"That would have been the company.\"\n\nAs they did with her brothers, lawyers for the state attorney general's office showed Ms Trump a series of emails meant to bolster their case, asking if she recognised the messages.\n\nThey pressed her on her role in securing loans from Deutsche Bank for the Trump National Doral Miami, the Old Post Office in Washington DC and Trump International Hotel & Tower Chicago.\n\nAt one point state attorneys produced an email she wrote to then-Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg about a loan.\n\n\"It doesn't get better than this,\" she wrote.\n\nShe said she did not remember that message.\n\nHer responses frustrated Louis Solomon, the state lawyer questioning her.\n\n\"She just spent three minutes describing the plaza hotel,\" he shouted, \"but she has no recollection when I ask her a question.\n\nDefence lawyers began cross-examining Ms Trump in the afternoon, marking the first time they have questioned a Trump family member in this trial.\n\nThey asked her a series of direct questions about her role in company financial statements, to each of which she replied that she had no involvement at all.\n\nThe defence team also sought to portray a harmonious relationship between the Trumps and their loan provider, Deutsche Bank.\n\nThe Trump lawyers have previously argued that banks were happy to do business with the family and incurred no harm from the relationship.\n\nToward the end of the day, tensions began to flare as Judge Engoron argued the defence was wasting time, calling one Trump attorney Jesus Saurez's questions \"ridiculous\".  Mr Suarez lost his temper after hearing the attorney general's team laugh at his questions from the bench behind him.  The Trumps' legal team argued once again that the judge was biased for siding with prosecutors' objections to Mr Suarez's questioning.  \"Your constant insinuations that I have some sort of double standard...it's just not true,\" Mr Engoron said in response.\n\nNonetheless, University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias told the BBC that Ms Trump's testimony was much less combative than her father's time on the witness stand on Monday.\n\nAnd her evidence could ultimately aid the former president, said Prof Tobias.\n\n\"The attorney general's counsel was able to introduce some documents that appeared helpful to their case,\" he said.\n\n\"But counsel did not seem to elicit much information from Ms Trump's testimony that was very damaging to Mr Trump.\"\n\nNew York's attorney general said on the courthouse steps on Wednesday morning that Ivanka Trump was \"very much involved\" in the family enterprise.\n\nFrom 2011-17, she was a top executive at the Trump Organization alongside her brothers Donald Jr and Eric.\n\nAs head of development and acquisitions, she played a key role in the types of real estate deals and loans at the heart of the case, say state attorneys.\n\nThe interest rates on the loans were low because they required a personal guarantee from Mr Trump and evidence of his liquidity and net worth.\n\nState attorneys argue that Mr Trump's annual financial statements were central to those loans and saved him more than $100m.\n\nMr Trump has taken several times to his social media platform, Truth Social, to defend his children.\n\nHours before Ms Trump's testimony, he said his \"wonderful and beautiful daughter\" was being unfairly dragged into the case.\n\nThe trial is expected to last until mid-December.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nColonel Archibald Gracie's letter from onboard the ill-fated ocean liner has been described as \"prophetic\".\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Ivanka Trump in Ethiopia to 'promote women'\n\nPresident Donald Trump's eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, is in Ethiopia to promote a US government initiative aimed at advancing women's participation in the workplace.\n\nThe initiative aims to benefit 50 million women in developing countries by 2025.\n\nMs Trump toured a female-run textile facility in the capital, Addis Ababa.\n\nThe US policy in Africa under President Trump has prioritised the war on terror and checking the influence of China.\n\nWhen his administration's long-delayed policy on Africa was finally unveiled at the close of 2018, many observers of the continent were quick to point out that it did not include the favoured American staples: promotion of democracy, free and fair elections, political and civil rights.\n\nThe Women's Global Development and Prosperity (W-GDP), which was launched in February, coincides with President Trump's proposed cuts to foreign aid, and a ban on US aid to health groups that promote or provide abortions.\n\nThe W-GDP initiative aims to train women worldwide to help them get well-paying jobs.\n\nMs Trump visited Muya Ethiopia, a clothes manufacturing company.\n\nThe 16-year-old company, which exports clothes to the local and international markets, was founded by Sara Abera, who gave Ms Trump a tour.\n\nAccording to the W-GDP's website, low participation of women in the formal labour markets impedes economic growth and poverty reduction in developing countries.\n\nThe project is financed by a $50m (£38m) fund within the US international development aid agency (USAid).\n\n\"Fundamentally we believe that investing in women is a smart development policy and it's smart business. It is also in our security interests because women when they are empowered they foster peace and stability and we have seen this play out time and time again,\" Ms Trump said as she met women working in the coffee industry.\n\nMs Trump, who serves as an adviser to her father, will also attend a World Bank policy summit while in Ethiopia.\n\nShe will visit Ivory Coast later in the week and is set to visit a cocoa farm, as well as participate in a meeting on economic opportunities for women in West Africa.\n\nShe tweeted ahead of the trip that she was \"excited\".\n\nThe Trump administration's policy in Africa has focused on the war on terror and trying to manage the growing political and economic influence of China and Russia on the continent.\n\nIt has, however, backed democratic reforms in countries like Ethiopia where Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has implemented a series of progressive changes including the normalisation of relations with Eritrea after a bitter border standoff going back two decades.\n\nThe US also recently backed pro-democratic protests in Algeria and Sudan.\n\nMr Trump, however, upset many in the continent last year after he reportedly used the word \"shithole\" to describe African nations .\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Melania's hat, shorts in winter and other eye-catching looks\n\nInauguration Day is all about pomp, pageantry - and pictures.\n\nThe clothes worn on this world stage - the colour, cut and details - take the spotlight. From Melania's striking hat to Usha's fashion forward overcoat, here's a roundup of some of the day's most memorable looks.\n\nMelania Trump kicked off Inauguration Day with an outfit that has all the hallmarks of her favoured first lady style: sharply cut, with spiked heels and a dramatic flourish via the headgear. It is simultaneously serious and chic.\n\nThe designer chosen by the 54-year-old first lady for the inauguration is the subject of fascination - and, again, an opportunity to transmit a message. That the former model chose New York designer Adam Lippes and a coordinating hat by Eric Javits, was a marked shift of gear.\n\nShe may have worn the American fashion designer Ralph Lauren to her husband's last inauguration, but much more frequently turns to the big European houses. Plus, unlike Lauren, neither Lippes nor Javits are such household, starry names.\n\nIn a statement, Lippes said the look had been hand-stitched in New York \"by some of America's finest craftsmen.\" Fittingly, Lippes recently opened a new boutique in Palm Beach, close to the Trump's home, Mar-a-Lago, or the \"southern White House\".\n\nVery much on-brand is the price tag: Melania Trump is known for her extravagant tastes - many of her outfits while previously first lady had price tags running well into the thousands - and Lippes' dresses, for example, go from £1,000 up to over £7,500.\n\nIt also speaks to her love of hats. The brim is wide enough and the contrast between the cream ribbon and navy hat big enough that it draws the eyes upwards - even if it obscures the eyes of the wearer.\n\nThere was a loadedness to its incongruity. As celebrity stylist and fashion expert Lauren Rothman points out, \"a boater is traditionally a summer hat. It's traditionally worn by, you know, in Venice, right?\" Not in a freezing cold DC.\n\n\"This was just such a spectacular use of signalling and blending Palm Beach and DC with international global fashion aesthetic, while understanding the traditional and political power that is also necessary for your look to communicate,\" she said.\n\nThe first lady made an equally dramatic appearance at the first inaugural ball wearing a full-length gown with a thick black ribbon-like strip, echoed in a choker-style necklace.\n\nFrom a distance, the inky squiggle could easily remind viewers of the signature that Melania's husband had earlier signed on a flurry of executive orders.\n\nHer black-and-white look was echoed in the classic tux worn by her husband, 24 years her senior.\n\nFirst daughter Ivanka Trump, 43, matched Melania's serious colour palette with an emerald green skirt suit with a matching hat.\n\nThe hourglass silhouette - the cinched in waist and fuller skirt - felt pointed and intentional. It was reminiscent of Dior's glamorous New Look, which ushered in a new era in fashion after World War Two.\n\nThe asymmetry of the cut, however, sounded a note of continuation: Ivanka wore a white Oscar de la Renta jacket with an asymmetric handkerchief hem for inauguration day in 2017.\n\nThe first daughter's outfit feels like it could be harking back to the work of Adolfo Sardiña, a Cuban-born American fashion designer who started out as an apprentice milliner at Bergdorf Goodman in the late 1940s and went on to be known for his spectacular hats, which were worn by Nancy Reagan to both of her husband's inaugurations.\n\nFor Lauren Rothman, the look had a very international flavour. \"We're seeing a little bit of Princess Kate style,\" she said.\n\nIt speaks to the idea of a Trump dynasty, in a way more akin to royalty than a democracy. \"Her look is really a signal that indicates her strong understanding of the political kingdom,\" she said.\n\nYet for all of its regality, Rothman also identifies an accessibility. She has clients already texting her asking, 'how can I get that outfit in another color?' And I've already sent a few links.\"\n\nFormer first lady Jill Biden, 73, yet again wore a purplish blue from head to toe - a colour that has come to represent the administration of the last four years.\n\nAt her husband's swearing-in ceremony in 2021, Jill wore a blue coat created by designer/founder Alexandra O'Neill for the New York-based luxury womenswear label Markarian. It reportedly quintupled sales for the designer. It was custom made and embroidered with Swarovski crystals, plus had a pandemic-era matching face mask.\n\nBoth Bidens have chosen to dress in clothes again by Ralph Lauren, whose designs and back story are often seen as synonymous with the American dream.\n\nIt comes as no surprise: Jill has worn his clothes throughout the last four years and was at his fashion show in the Hamptons last September.\n\nHer husband recently awarded Lauren the Presidential Medal of Freedom - the nation's highest civilian honour - and in the process made him the first fashion designer to receive the distinction.\n\nLauren suits have been a fitting uniform of choice for the outgoing president. On the White House website as he leaves office, it sums up his presidency: \"for all Americans, a country for all Americans, a future for all Americans.\"\n\nYou could argue his Lauren suits are also designed to not leave any Americans out - never straying too far from classic blue and classic lines.\n\nThe lawyer and wife of Vice President-elect JD Vance, Usha Vance's most high profile appearance to date was speaking the 2024 Republican National Convention. For the occasion, the 39-year-old chose a cobalt blue off-the-shoulder Badgley Mischka dress, which retails for $495 (£400). According to a spokesperson speaking to industry website WWD, Vance must have bought the garment herself as the brand wasn't consulted.\n\nBut, there were clear signs of a pivot to more high-fashion choices. She chose an Oscar de la Renta overcoat with a strikingly fashion-forward detail: a scarf intentionally tucked into her waist-height belt. Is it a sign of a more stylised image to come as Vance takes her place as the second lady?\n\nI would absolutely label her as one to watch,\" said Lauren Rothman, \"because she is the newest member into the spotlight, she is receiving help - and it's working.\" Plus: \"her energy indicates a comfort in it. Like, I was ready for this.\"\n\nShe sees an authenticity too: \"It doesn't look like a costume. It looks like she's having fun.\" She cited an optimism in the choice of pink, where many of the other figures in Trump's universe went for more sombre colours.\n\nSuits, ties, shoulder pads, pearls; these are the traditional attire of inauguration day. But John Fetterman, the 55-year-old US senator from Pennsylvania since 2023, has never been one to stick to traditional dress codes - he wore a Carhartt hoodie with a picture of a bow-tie printed onto it for the White House Correspondents' Dinner last year.\n\nStill, if tradition didn't mean Fetterman opted for a pair of trousers, you would have thought the weather might - temperatures in Washington were so low that the ceremony was moved inside for the first time since 1985. Yet Fetterman showed up coatless, in only a hoodie, and wearing shorts.\n\nIt is fitting - Fetterman is all about bucking convention - he was, after all, the first Senate Democrat to meet with Trump since the election.\n\nThe \"tech bros\" have been undergoing some interesting style shifts of late. Most recently in Elon Musk's case, a Belstaff jacket drew the internet's eyes, while Mark Zuckerberg's style makeover has seen him transform from \"normcore\" grey T-shirts and inconspicuous jeans to luxury labels, his own brand of slogan T-shirts with Greek and Latin phrases and million pound watches.\n\nFor Lauren Rothman, there was \"a sleekness\" about the way they looked, \"and they also sort of showed up as a squad, sunglasses and suits.\"\n\nBut, she said, \"the most significant part of how the tech giants showed up was in their significant others. Mark Zuckerberg's wife Priscilla Chan wore \"the classic DC look: a short statement necklace and a buttoned up coat\".\n\nThe author and fiancée to Jeff Bezos, Lauren Sanchez, by contrast to both the darkly suited tech entrepreneurs surrounding her, as well as to Chan, wore a startling white Alexander McQueen suit with pointed, padded shoulders. Underneath was a lingerie-inspired look that has already drawn some criticism online for a perceived lack of appropriateness on a state occasion.\n\nAt Bill Clinton's 1997 inauguration, Hillary Clinton wore a candy floss-pink outfit by Oscar de la Renta. And to her husband's first swearing-in ceremony in 1993 she went for an unusually busy look - a checked suit and a blue velour hat.\n\nIn 2017 at Trump's first inauguration, she wore a white and cream Lauren pantsuit - the outfit that clearly makes her feel most battle-ready and professional.\n\nIn marked contrast to her previous palette, the 77-year-old went for a grave navy this time round. On her coat there was a single brooch.\n\nIts details remain unclear but brooches are often the site of sartorial messaging and Clinton knows it. She recently wore a bald eagle brooch - a national symbol - with the US flag on it for the funeral of Jimmy Carter.\n\nThe look was by British sustainable designer Stella McCartney, a move that feels like it could be aimed at the incoming administration's climate plans.\n\nTrump has confirmed plans to once again pull the US out of the Paris agreement, which tries to mitigate the worst impacts of the climate crisis.\n\nWhat the incoming president chose to wear was never going to stray too far from his norm of navy suits.\n\nAccording to Lauren Rothman, \"we're still seeing, you know, a pretty simple suit\" but she said the big difference and a \"huge signal that is different, is in his tie.\"\n\n\"It's really ultimately a mix of red and blue, which creates a purple effect.\n\n\"The more muted tie kind of signals in my world, I don't need to scream. I don't need to project. I have arrived.\"\n\nAnother big point of interest, particularly on Inauguration Day, is where the president gets his suits.\n\nIt is unclear where the 78-year-old's suit came from, but as he used his inauguration speech to talk about increasing American industry, it would be fitting from him to wear an American suit, menswear expert Derek Guy pointed out.\n\n\"American manufacturing is on the decline, especially in clothing. Some of the factories that made clothes for previous inaugurations have since shuttered. It would be nice to see more support for American manufacturing, even if it's only symbolic,\" he said.\n\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter .

      "text": "Ivanka Trump: Who is America's first daughter?\n\nMs Trump is said to be her father's favourite child\n\nIvanka Trump, the oldest daughter of President Donald Trump, has quickly moved from a behind-the-scenes adviser to a White House power player. Now she will share the national stage with her father at the Republican National Convention.\n\nWhile her two brothers, Donald Jr and Eric Trump, took control of the family business following the 2016 election, Ms Trump followed her father to Washington.\n\nThe 38-year-old mother-of-three and her husband, Jared Kushner, have both played influential roles in Mr Trump's administration during his first term.\n\nShe joined German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and IMF chief Christine Lagarde, at the G20 women's summit in 2019, sparking criticism. And she has sat in meetings with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping during state visits.\n\nMs Trump was born in New York City in 1981 to Mr Trump and his first wife, Czech model Ivana Trump.\n\nIvanka remained in the public eye throughout her childhood after her parents divorced when she was 10.\n\nShe began a short-lived modelling career in 1997, appearing in Seventeen magazine and on the runway for fashion brands Versace, Marc Bouwer and Thierry Mugler.\n\nShe later attended Georgetown University for two years before transferring to University of Pennsylvania, where she graduated in 2004.\n\nMs Trump and her husband relocated to Washington shortly after the election\n\nMs Trump converted to Judaism after marrying Mr Kushner, the son of a prominent New York property developer, in 2009.\n\nThe pair have three young children: Arabella, Joseph and Theodore.\n\nMr Trump gave his daughter a level of authority in the family business that none of his wives ever had.\n\nShe would rise to become an executive vice-president of development and acquisition along with her two brothers and is said to have handled some of the Trump Organization's biggest deals.\n\nAmerica's other first lady?\n\nJared Kushner: Who is the Trump whisperer?\n\nMs Trump helped expand the Trump Hotel brand abroad, handled interior design of the hotels and oversaw their international real estate brokerage, according to the Trump website.\n\nShe also launched her own eponymous fashion line, which was dropped by several retail chains as part of a Trump brand boycott after the election.\n\nBut the brand's president said the company saw a reported sales surge earlier this year amid the backlash.\n\nMr Trump often cites his daughter as one of his most trusted advisers\n\nShe has released two books including The Trump Card, which was published in 2009, and Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success, which is due out this year.\n\nMs Trump also appeared as a judge on her father's reality television show, The Apprentice.\n\nShe has since stepped down from her role at the Trump Organization, although she will continue to receive fixed payments from the real estate firm.\n\nThe former business executive also handed over control of her fashion line to the company's president and transferred its assets to a trust for oversight.\n\nBut some ethics experts say Ms Trump's unspecified role at the White House has raised questions about whether she is violating conflict-of-interest rules.\n\nMs Trump has increasingly appeared alongside her father at high-level meetings with political, business and world leaders.\n\nShe was given a coveted West Wing office and security clearance before she formally joined the Trump White House as an unpaid special assistant.\n\nThis video can not be played\n\nIvanka Trump treads gingerly into West Wing ethics minefield\n\nBefore her father's inauguration, she told CBS she would not join the administration and would instead focus on being a daughter.  But Ms Trump and her husband have become some of Mr Trump's most visible aides both at home and abroad.\n\nMr Kushner was tasked with brokering peace in the Middle East, reforming the criminal justice system and managing the Office of American Innovation, which tackles reforming the federal government and the opioid epidemic.\n\nBut perhaps his most important job came in 2020 in the coronavirus response team when he was tasked with devising a national testing plan and leading the quest for medical supplies. But testing has been left up to the states and governors were critical early on of the federal efforts to secure PPE.\n\nMs Trump, who appealed to working women throughout her father's presidential campaign, had said she wanted to focus on issues such as equal pay for women and paid parental leave.\n\nShe has frequently defended her father against criticism of his treatment of women, especially after a tape of him making obscene remarks was released during the presidential campaign.\n\nThis video can not be played\n\nJared Kushner prefers the role of silent adviser. What does he do now?\n\nAnd Ms Trump has faced her own criticism for not publicly speaking out against some of her father's more controversial actions.\n\n\"Where I disagree with my father, he knows it,\" she told CBS' This Morning, adding that she voices her opinion \"quietly and directly and candidly\".\n\nMs Trump's roving role means she has popped up in unlikely places.\n\nIn early 2018, she led the US delegation to the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics in South Korea.\n\nA few months later, her father said he was tempted to give her the UN ambassadorship but he resisted because he would be accused of nepotism. A year later she turned down his offer to head the World Bank.\n\nOne of her most controversial episodes came when it emerged she had used her own email account to send hundreds of messages to officials. In 2016, her father Donald Trump accused Hillary Clinton of putting the US \"in danger\" over her use of a private email while secretary of state. It became a huge campaign issue.\n\nCriticism of her appearance at the G20 summit in Osaka deepened when the French president posted a clip of her inserting herself into a conversation , external with other world leaders.\n\nMs Trump also made headlines when she and her father were criticised for endorsing a Hispanic food company on social media. They were responding to calls to boycott the company, Goya Foods, because its head had expressed his support for Mr Trump.\n\nA trip she and her family made from Washington DC to Bedminster in New Jersey during the pandemic lockdown was in contravention of federal guidelines advising Americans to remain at home. The White House defended her travel, saying it was not commercial.\n\nShortly ahead of her trip, Ms Trump had told her Twitter followers: \"Those lucky enough to be in a position to stay at home, please, please do so.\"\n\nPolice to give update after man drives car into Vancouver festival killing nine\n\nImages of Pope Francis's tomb released\n\nGreens call for single-sex guidance to be withdrawn\n\nHow the next Pope is chosen\n\n'Kicking butt' or 'going too fast'?

Was she sending classified information over a private system?\" he added.\n\nPeter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Ms Trump's counsel Abbe Lowell, said in a statement to US media: \"Ms Trump sometimes used her private account, almost always for logistics and scheduling concerning her family.\"\n\nHe added that Ms Trump did not create a private server and never transmitted any classified information.\n\n\"The account was never transferred or housed at Trump Organization, no emails were ever deleted, and the emails have been retained in the official account in conformity with records preservation laws and rules.\"\n\nDuring his presidential campaign in 2016, Donald Trump said that Mrs Clinton's use of a private server to send official emails while in her post as secretary of state in 2009 was a scandal \"bigger than Watergate\".\n\nHe repeatedly criticised her conduct, calling her actions \"illegal\" and a threat to the security of the US.\n\nAt the time of his campaign, Mr Trump frequently encouraged crowds at rallies to chant \"lock her up\" and threatened to imprison Mrs Clinton over the saga.\n\nHe also called on Russia to help locate some 30,000 emails that Mrs Clinton had not turned over to investigators after she, or her lawyers, determined it was unnecessary as they were personal messages.\n\nBefore becoming secretary of state, Mrs Clinton set up an email server at her home in Chappaqua, New York, that she used for all work and personal emails during her four years in office.\n\nShe did not use, or even activate, a state.gov email account, which would have been hosted on servers owned and managed by the US government.\n\nShe said it was for convenience.\n\nAn FBI investigation concluded that Mrs Clinton should not face charges, but said she and her aides had been \"extremely careless\" in their handling of classified information.\n\nIt is not illegal for White House officials to use personal email accounts for government business.\n\nHowever, under the Presidential Records Act and Federal Records Act, government officials must forward any official correspondence to a work account within 20 days for preservation.\n\nIf this is not done reliably, the use of private accounts can put official records beyond the reach of journalists, lawmakers and others who seek publicly available information.\n\nThere are also rules against sharing classified or privileged information on personal email accounts.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Jan. 6 panel has 'firsthand testimony' that Ivanka asked Trump to intervene during riot, Cheney says\n\nThe House panel investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot has testimony that then-President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump asked him to intervene as his supporters ransacked the home of Congress, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said Sunday.\n\n\"We have firsthand testimony now that he was sitting in the dining room next to the Oval Office, watching the attack. The briefing room at the White House is a mere few steps from the Oval Office,\" Cheney, vice chair of the committee, said on ABC News' \"This Week.\"\n\nShe added that at any moment, Trump could have walked to the press briefing room and appeared on television.\n\n\"We know as [Trump] was sitting there in the dining room, next to the Oval Office, members of his staff were pleading with him to go on television to tell people to stop. We know [Republican] Leader [Kevin] McCarthy was pleading with him to do that. We know his daughter - we have firsthand testimony - that his daughter Ivanka went in at least twice to ask him to please stop this violence.\"\n\nRead more from NBC News: Twitter permanently suspends Marjorie Taylor Greene's personal account New laws in 2022 address surprise medical bills, chained pets, cocktails-to-go CDC considering testing guidelines for the asymptomatic, Fauci says\n\nIn a one-minute video released on social media hours after the attack began, Trump repeated false claims about the election he lost while encouraging the rioters, who attacked the Capitol in an attempt to disrupt the electoral vote count formalizing Joe Biden's win before a joint session of Congress, to \"go home in peace.\"\n\n\"Go home. We love you. You're very special,\" Trump said.\n\nAfter the video was shared, he later tweeted, \"These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long.\"\n\nTwitter took action against both messages, and permanently suspended Trump in the days after the riot , citing \"the risk of further incitement of violence.\"\n\nThompson said on NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" that the panel believes Trump made \"several videos\" before releasing the short clip and that it has asked the National Archives for the alleged videos that were never shared.\n\n\"It's about 187 minutes,\" he said in an interview that aired Sunday, in reference to the length of time it took for Trump to publicly urge his supporters to leave the Capitol after the attack began.\n\nRepresentatives for the former president and Ivanka Trump did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nOver the past few months, the Jan. 6 committee has been accelerating its probe into the riot, as well as any actions or inaction by Trump and his allies. The House voted last month to refer former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to the Justice Department for a criminal charge over his refusal to answer the committee's questions.\n\nThe panel also recently asked Reps. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio., and Scott Perry, R-Pa., to provide information about their activities, although committee chair Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said Sunday that the panel's ability to subpoena the lawmakers remains uncertain.\n\nAs the anniversary of Jan. 6 nears, Thompson appeared on three separate Sunday programs to discuss the congressional probe into the deadly event as well as the pro-Trump rally that preceded it. The then-president spoke at the rally and encouraged those there to march to the Capitol, where Congress was engaged in formalizing President Joe Biden's election win.\n\nThompson said the panel has evidence of interactions between House members and rioters on Jan. 6 that may or may not necessarily be of a significant nature. He did not specify which members.\n\n\"Now, 'assisted' means different things,\" he said on NBC News' \"Meet the Press.\" \"Some took pictures with people who came to the 'Stop the Steal' rally. Some, you know, allowed them to come and associate in their offices and other things during that whole rally week. So, there's some participation.\"\n\nThompson also said the panel intends to recommend new legislation to improve U.S. intelligence gathering , which if adopted, hopefully will ensure \"this will never, ever happen again.\"\n\n\"As you know, it was clear that we were not apprised that something would happen. But for the most part that it was the worst-kept secret in America that people were coming into Washington, and the potential for coordination and what we saw was there. So, we want to make sure that never happens again,\" Thompson said on ABC News' \"This Week.\"\n\nA Senate report released in June, which was the result of a joint investigation by the Homeland Security and Rules committees, summed up what it says were profound intelligence and security failures that contributed to one of the worst incidents of domestic terrorism in U.S. history.\n\nThe report found that a key contributing factor to the events of Jan. 6 was the failure of the intelligence community to \"properly analyze, assess, and disseminate information to law enforcement\" regarding the potential for violence and the known threats to the Capitol.\n\nIn the report, one unnamed Capitol police officer was quoted as saying, \"We were ill prepared. We were NOT informed with intelligence. We were betrayed.\"\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the Jan. 6 riot was, \"in part, an intelligence failure that is the failure to see all the evidence that was out there to be seen of the propensity for violence that day,\" on CBS News' \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee will also recommend legislation on how to improve the coordination of resources to protect the Capitol, according to Thompson.\n\n\"There were significant inconsistencies in coordination. The National Guard from the District of Columbia was slow to respond, not on its own but it had to go to the Department of Defense,\" he told \"This Week.\" \"We want to make sure that the line of communication between the Capitol police and the structure of how we make decisions is clear. Right now, it's kind of a hybrid authority and that authority clearly broke down.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Judge orders Ivanka Trump to testify in her father's New York civil fraud trial\n\nThe judge overseeing the $250 million civil trial against Donald Trump and his company ordered the former president's daughter Ivanka Trump to testify in the case.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron said Friday she could not be called as a witness before Nov. 1, giving her time to appeal the ruling if she chooses.\n\nTrump's attorneys had challenged New York Attorney General Letitia James' subpoena to Ivanka Trump, noting an appeals court had ruled earlier this year that she should be dropped as a defendant in the case over statute of limitations issues.\n\nThey contended the New York attorney general's office was trying \"to continue to harass and burden President Trump's daughter long after\" the appeals court \"mandated she be dismissed from the case.\"\n\nThey also contended that the AG waited too long to subpoena her, and argued the office doesn't have jurisdiction over her because she no longer lives in the state.\n\nThe AG's office contended that Ivanka Trump, a former White House official, still has information important to their case.\n\n\"While no longer a Defendant in this action, she indisputably has personal knowledge of facts relevant to the claims against the remaining individual and entity Defendants. But even beyond that, Ms. Trump remains financially and professionally intertwined with the Trump Organization and other Defendants and can be called as a person still under their control,\" the AG contended in a court filing.\n\nMore from NBC News:\n\nThe office said it wanted to ask her questions about Trump's former Washington, D.C. hotel, and noted she profited from the sale.\n\n\"Ms. Trump remains under the control of the Trump Organization, including through her ongoing and substantial business ties to the organization,\" the AG argued, adding that she \"does not seem to be averse to her involvement in the family business when it comes to owning and collecting proceeds from the OPO (hotel) sale, the Trump Organization purchasing insurance for her and her companies, managing her household staff and credit card bills, renting her apartment or even paying her legal fees in this action. It is only when she is tasked with answering for that involvement that she disclaims any connection.\"\n\nIvanka Trump's siblings Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and their father are all expected to testify in the case and have been listed as witnesses by both the AG and the defense.\n\nThe AG is suing Trump for allegedly inflating his assets in financial statements to secure more cost-effective loans and insurance policies. Trump has denied any wrongdoing in the case, which he has called a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Trump turns the White House lawn into a Tesla showroom\n\nIn this article\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday turned the South Lawn of the White House into a temporary Tesla showroom in a conspicuous favor to his adviser Elon Musk , the billionaire CEO of the car company.\n\nTesla delivered five of its vehicles to the White House and parked them on a driveway for Trump to personally inspect, hours after he said in a post on his app Truth Social that he planned to buy a Tesla to demonstrate his support for Musk and for the slumping car company .\n\nWith Musk beside him, Trump declared the vehicles \"beautiful\" and in particular praised the company's unusually designed Cybertruck.\n\n\"As soon as I saw it, I said, 'That is the coolest design,'\" Trump said.\n\nThough Trump frequently attacked electric vehicles during last year's campaign, he told reporters that he'd heard good things about Teslas from his friends. He sat in the driver's seat of a sedan, with Musk seated beside him, and said he planned to buy one.\n\n\"The one I like is that one, and I want the same color,\" he said, pointing to a red Model S. The vehicle is listed on the Tesla website for $73,490, or $88,490 for the all-wheel-drive Model S Plaid.\n\nHe did not take a test drive but said he might \"another time.\"\n\nBecause of ethical restraints it is extremely rare for a senior government official, let alone a sitting president, to endorse a consumer product so explicitly. In 2017, when then-Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway told Americans to buy from Ivanka Trump's clothing line, she received a warning from a government ethics office and promised never to do it again.\n\nBy reviewing the Teslas in public before cameras, Trump ensured that his purchase would receive wide attention. Dan Scavino, a White House deputy chief of staff, livestreamed the event on X, the social media app owned by Musk.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the application of ethics rules.\n\nTrump said he would pay for the vehicle by check.\n\nIn his first weeks in office, Trump has increasingly moved away from the populist policies and messaging of both his first term and his campaigns, instead embracing the interests and agendas of his billionaire backers. Musk, in particular, has led the administration's push to cut thousands of largely middle-class federal jobs, and Americans are seeing their retirement savings tank as the stock market plummets amid uncertainty over Trump's policies. Yet it was Musk that Trump focused on boosting Tuesday.\n\nTesla, meanwhile, has faced an extended global backlash to Musk's increasing role in politics, most notably for his role in slashing government jobs and recent promotion of far-right parties including Germany's AfD . The company's shares have declined every week since Musk went to Washington, and they fell 15% on Monday before rebounding Tuesday. Tesla facilities have faced a wave of both peaceful demonstrations and vandalism, including fires at charging stations.\n\nAsked whether his purchase might help Tesla's stock, Trump said, \"I hope it does.\"\n\nDuring the event, Trump held a piece of paper with notes about Tesla features, according to photos of the notes published by Getty Images. The notes appeared to be something of a sales pitch, including details that Teslas could be purchased for $299 a month and that all vehicles \"have self-driving\" - a reference to the company's suite of driver-assistance features, which cost extra and still require human supervision .\n\nTrump condemned the vandalism and heaped praise on the company.\n\n\"They're harming a great American company,\" he said. Referring to Musk, he said: \"He's built this great company, and he shouldn't be penalized because he's a patriot.\"\n\nMusk, standing next to Trump, said that Tesla planned to double vehicle output in the United States.\n\nMusk is at the center of growing tension within the government about his role as a White House adviser and head of Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. The Trump administration is battling lawsuits that say Musk has exceeded his authority under the law and the Constitution, and members of Trump's Cabinet have privately expressed frustrations about Musk's involvement in their agencies.\n\nMusk was a major financial supporter of Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, spending more than a quarter of a billion dollars and making personal appearances on Trump's behalf in the swing state Pennsylvania. Musk also turned X into a pro-Trump media platform .\n\nIn a post on Truth Social shortly after midnight, early Tuesday morning, Trump was unabashed in his reason for buying a Tesla.\n\n\"I'm going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American,\" he wrote.\n\nIt's not clear when, if ever, Trump would have the chance to drive a car of any kind unless he does so within the White House complex or similarly secure area. Presidents are driven around in a custom limousine with special security features.\n\n\"I haven't bought a new car in a long time,\" Trump said.\n\nRead more NBC News\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Ivanka Trump asks to pause NY fraud trial, says testimony during 'school week' creates 'undue hardship'\n\nIvanka Trump asked a New York appeals court to pause the $250 million fraud trial of her family and its business empire as she appeals a judge 's order requiring her to testify in the case next week.\n\nThe request to stay the entire trial came at the tail end of a Thursday court filing arguing that Ivanka Trump will face \"undue hardship\" if forced to testify - in part because she is scheduled to appear \"in the middle of a school week.\"\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James urged the appeals court to reject that request, calling it a \"drastic\" and baseless move that \"would upend an ongoing trial.\"\n\nIvanka Trump's filing in the First Judicial Department of the New York Supreme Court's Appellate Division mainly sought a temporary stay of the order for her testimony while she pursues an appeal.\n\nOn Wednesday, her attorney filed a notice that she is appealing \"each and every part\" of Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Arthur Engoron's order rejecting her bid to avoid the witness stand.\n\nShe is currently expected to begin testifying next Wednesday, following her father, former President Donald Trump .\n\nHer two adult brothers, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, testified this week .\n\nAll three of Ivanka's family members are named as co-defendants in James' case, alleging a decade-long scheme to falsely inflate Donald Trump Sr.'s net worth in order to get various financial perks, including tax benefits and better loan terms.\n\nIvanka Trump was originally listed as a co-defendant as well, but she was removed earlier this year on statute of limitations grounds by a New York appeals court earlier.\n\nJames' lawsuit described her an executive vice president for development and acquisitions at the Trump Organization until early January 2017, when she became a senior advisor to her father in the White House.\n\nEric and Trump Jr. took over the Trump Organization after their father became president.\n\nIn Thursday's filing to the appeals court, Ivanka's attorney argued that she is \"beyond the jurisdiction\" of Engoron's court and that the judge made \"multiple errors\" when he declined to quash subpoenas for her testimony.\n\nThe lawyer, Bennett Moskowitz, argued the court lacks personal jurisdiction over Ivanka, noting that she lives not in New York but in Florida.\n\nHe also argued that her subpoenas were improperly served. \"Ms. Trump, who resides in Florida with her three minor children, will suffer undue hardship if a stay is denied and she is required to testify at trial in New York in the middle of a school week, in a case she has already been dismissed from, before her appeal is heard,\" Moskowitz wrote.\n\nJames fired back in a court filing later Thursday, calling the arguments about a lack of jurisdiction \"utterly meritless.\" The attorney general noted that Ivanka owns New York property and \"still transacts business in the state.\"\n\n\"Ms. Trump's arguments are based on the false premise that witnesses with relevant, firsthand knowledge may be called to testify only if they are 'a primary actor' in the case,\" James told the appeals court.\n\nIvanka Trump \"has firsthand knowledge of issues that are central to the ongoing trial,\" James wrote. \"And staying her testimony may well serve to delay the fair and orderly resolution of a trial that has now been proceeding for over almost a month, in which OAG is nearing completion of its case in chief.\"\n\nJames added: \"Ms. Trump's mere need to attend trial for a single day to testify truthfully is not itself a serious harm that warrants emergency relief.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Did Family Members of Trump and His Team Cash In on Their Connections?\n\nA viral meme is largely correct on one point but misleading on two others.\n\nA viral post from popular left-wing Facebook account The Other 98% claims that various family members of individuals in former-President Donald Trump's orbit received lucrative government positions.\n\nRudy Giuliani's son, Andrew, did indeed work in the White House's Office of Public Liaison, where he reportedly coordinated visits and events with sports teams and athletes. His initial salary for these duties in 2017 was $77,000, though he received a raise in 2018, seeing his salary increase to $90,700. By 2019, Andrew Giuliani had a salary of $95,000. Assuming he received the same amount of pay in the final year of the Trump administration, Giuliani would have been paid a total of $357,700 over the course of four years.\n\nThe post's other claims, however, are less clear-cut. The claim about Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump is ambiguous. Each had a high-profile job as an adviser in the White House, but neither took a salary for their White House work , as some might think after seeing the post. However, some critics have argued that they stood to benefit financially from their positions given their continued outside business interests. Kushner, for example, had a stake in 666 Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, which saw a number of potential foreign investors during the Trump administration. Ivanka Trump had trademarks for her fashion line fast tracked in China after her father was elected president, though she later closed the line in 2018.\n\nBill Barr's daughter, Mary Daly, did work for the Treasury Department, but she started in this role shortly before Barr was confirmed as attorney general. She and her husband, Tyler McGaughey, had both worked in the Department of Justice before Barr began his tenure. Daly, a former federal prosecutor who had handled many drug cases during her 13-year tenure, had worked as the director of Opioid Enforcement and Prevention Efforts in the deputy attorney general's office until she moved to the Treasury Department's financial crimes unit, and McGaughey moved from the U.S. Attorney's Office to work in the White House. There was some suggestion that the moves were made to avoid any conflict of interest once Barr became attorney general.\n\nWhile The Other 98%'s post is largely correct about Andrew Giuliani's role in the Trump administration, its claim about Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump is potentially misleading and it left out important context surrounding Mary Daly's position in the Treasury Department.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com .

      "text": "Why GOP Voters Are Sticking With Donald Trump\n\nTheir enthusiastic support clashes with that of hesitant elected Republicans\n\nSpend some time talking to voters passionate about Donald Trump. That they're unapologetic in their support of the presumptive Republican nominee is no surprise. What's striking is how earnest many are in their faith that the former president is a genuine \"good guy,\" compared to so many GOP officials who have offered tepid 2024 endorsements through gritted teeth.\n\n\"What is there not to like about him?\" retiree Paula Johnson told The Dispatch in January, departing a Trump campaign event in Manchester, New Hampshire, hosted by New York Rep. Elise Stefanik. \"He loves us; he loves our country. So, that's why we're supporting him.\"\n\n\"He does everything that he says he's going to do; like, the border, and all of that,\" added Richard Hinson, 58, outside of a Nikki Haley campaign rally in Moncks Corner, South Carolina, where he lives and works for a power company. \"He's not a politician, you know? And I can relate more to that even though he's a billionaire or whatever. And it just seems like he's more for the small guy than one of these politicians.\"\n\nTheir explanations for backing Trump over Haley and others in the GOP primary-and over President Joe Biden in November-present a stark contrast to the rationalizations offered by the slew of prominent elected Republicans who rushed to endorse the 45th president once it became clear he was headed for his third consecutive nomination.\n\n\"I am a lifelong Republican, and I will support Donald Trump as our party's nominee for President,\" Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska said in a post on X , formerly Twitter. Bacon, running for reelection in an Omaha-area district that supported Biden over Trump in 2020, added: \"Republican voters across our country have spoken, and it is clear we want to return to the secure borders, strong economy, energy independence, and SCOTUS nominations that President Trump delivered. It is time to defeat Joe Biden.\"\n\n\"To beat Biden, Republicans need to unite around a single candidate, and it's clear that President Trump is Republican voters' choice,\" added Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, also on X . Cornyn, running to replace outgoing Minority Leader Mitch McConnell as the Senate's top Republican, added: \"Four more years of failed domestic policies like the Biden Border Crisis and record-high inflation, and failed foreign policies that have emboldened our adversaries and made the world a more dangerous place, must be stopped.\"\n\nIt makes zero political and professional sense for congressional Republicans to turn their backs on their party's presidential nominee, and it's unrealistic to expect them to support a Democratic incumbent. Stipulated. But the thruline in both the Bacon and Cornyn statements ( and others ) is: \"Republican voters made us do it.\" That explanation also is understandable: Trump over the past eight years has racked up his share of black marks, giving elected Republicans myriad excuses for keeping their distance.\n\nWhere to start.\n\nTrump did not concede defeat to Biden, claiming erroneously that the 2020 election was stolen. Then, on January 6, 2021, Trump fomented a riot in the U.S. Capitol, with his grassroots supporters storming the building in a bid to overturn the election by halting certification of Biden's Electoral College victory. More than two years after leaving office, Trump was indicted by the Justice Department for allegedly mishandling classified documents and obstructing the federal investigation into his refusal to transfer government material to the National Archives.\n\nWhile that may be the most clear-cut criminal case against him, Trump is also under indictment in three additional criminal cases and was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation in two civil cases filed by E. Jean Carroll. He has at times said the Constitution should be suspended ; suggested he wants to rule like a dictator (at least for  day); called political opponents \" vermin ;\" coopted racist tropes to declare illegal immigrants are \" poisoning the blood of our country ;\" and cozied up to authoritarians, including Friday when he hosted Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán at Mar-a-Lago, his winter residence and private social club in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nPolitically, Trump's leadership of the Republican Party has been shoddy.\n\nOn his watch, the GOP lost control of the House (2018); the White House (2020); and the Senate (losing Georgia's seats in a pair of January 5, 2021, special election runoffs.) Democrats retained their Senate majority in the 2022 midterms-even gaining a seat in Pennsylvania-despite Biden's low approval ratings, high inflation, and concerns about crime, as one flawed Trump-endorsed candidate after another suffered defeat amid independent voters' exhaustion with the former president. Ditto the House, where Republicans barely managed to win a four-seat majority.\n\nMeanwhile, on key issues many elected Republicans claim to care about, including fiscal responsibility, reducing the size and scope of government and American global leadership, Trump fell short. The debt and deficit skyrocketed during his presidency, growing from roughly $20 trillion to approximately $28 trillion; he opposes entitlement reform; and he regularly threatens American retreat from diplomatic and military alliances in Asia and Europe. Trump still does, saying recently he would \" encourage \" Russia to invade other North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries if they do not increase defense spending.\n\nAs Trump said during an interview with CNBC Monday: \"I'm not conservative. You know what I am? I'm a man of common sense.\"\n\nGrassroots Trump loyalists often are maligned with accusations that they back the former president despite these flaws-or even because of these flaws. To be sure, those voters are out there; no doubt. But during the several months of the GOP primary, especially this winter in the key early primary states, The Dispatch talked with voters who simply have a different view of the former president than the one that predominates in some Republican and media circles in Washington.\n\n\"He just, he's a good guy-good guy, good man and he's got a great family,\" Steven Steiner, a 63-year-old real estate agent in New Hampshire said on January 23 at Trump's election night celebration in the Granite State. \"Four years ago today I had a chance to meet Ivanka Trump, and I told her my story. My story was simple: I lost my 19 year-old son to oxycontin and I wanted the White House to use the bully pulpit to go after [this issue.] That's what Trump did-went out and used the bully pulpit .\"\n\n\"He listened. He did a good job,\" Steiner added. Steiner is a lifelong Republican, not a former Democrat attracted to the party by Trump and his heterodox views. We asked Steiner to address concerns many voters, right and the left, have about Trump.\n\nFor instance: The former president's flirtation with governing like a dictator? \" He said he's going to be a dictator for one day. He's going to sign an [executive] order for the pipeline going again, and he's going to close the border and start dealing with immigration.\" And, the worry that he will ignore constitutional term limits and attempt to remain in office after his second four years is up? \"That's bulls-t.\"\n\nIs Trump at least partially responsible for a national debt after working hand-in-glove with a Democratic-run House, and a Republican-led Senate, to spend billions of dollars in extra federal cash to mitigate the fallout from the deadly coronavirus pandemic?\n\n\"I don't think so,\" said Douglas Benton, 70, retired from the information technology industry and who we met in late February while he was waving a giant \"Trump 2024\" flag outside of a Haley campaign rally in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. \"He couldn't get anything through the Congress because they had the House and the Senate when he was president and they hold the purse strings.\" (It's unclear if Benton was blaming Democrats, Republicans or both, although Trump's Republican allies controlled the House and Senate during Trump's first two years in office.)\n\nTo Benton's point, Trump is the Republican nominee, yet again, because many supporters see him as a victim-of circumstance, of the media, of the Democratic machine, and of a so-called GOP establishment powerful enough to thwart his presidency even though it was too weak to depose him as titular leader of the party since then, never mind block him from the 2024 nomination, which he clinched this week. This sympathy for Trump is fueled by two critical factors: They believe he did an exceedingly good job as president and do not think he did anything wrong, then or since.\n\nTrump's loyal grassroots following might be wrong about him, but they're not being insincere or politically expedient; they believe the former president's dubious claims.\n\nThey're not holding their nose like Steve Deace, a well known Iowa conservative and BlazeTV host who previously endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Of his decision to back Trump, whom he argues is consumed by \"delusional narcissism\" and is \"nearly impossible to like or admire,\" Deace writes : \"His self-destructive decisions during the COVID hysteria make supporting the former president almost impossible. But the stakes are too high to let the other party win.\"\n\nContrast Deace's comments with what a middle-aged married couple in Moncks Corner told The Dispatch during an extended discussion about why they would rather give Trump another four years, versus nominating a Republican who, if he or she defeated Biden, could run for reelection and if successful deliver eight years of GOP rule in the White House.\n\n\"Like a lot of people, you kind of cringe when you hear some of the things he says,\" said Michael Large, a 63-year-old Air Force veteran. \"But man, after four years, and you just kind of watch everything that he did, that he said he was going to do; and never taking a paycheck while he was in office, donated the money every year, didn't go into political office for monetary gain or self-gain, I believe he really does want to do something good for this country.\"\n\n\"He lost money,\" added Large's wife, Leslie Large, who works for the local water department. She proceeded to raise a point oft-mentioned by many Trump supporters, that the former president \"deserves\" the second term they believe he was denied, or at the very least was unfairly disrupted, citing the federal investigation into allegations he colluded with Russia during the 2016 campaign and their doubts that Biden's victory in 2020 was on the up-and-up.\n\n\"He's a proven candidate,\" Michael Large interjected, \"and I believe he deserves another four years to right the wrongs that have been done to him all this time, even out of office and when he was in office-all the knocks on his family, his business, his integrity.\"\n\nDavid M.

      "text": "The Morning Dispatch: War in Ukraine Creeps Closer\n\n\"We are now at a stage where Russia could, at any point, launch an attack on Ukraine.\"\n\nHappy Friday! We really hope World War III hasn't started by the next time we're in your inbox.\n\nOne day after Democrats' voting reform bills failed to advance in the Senate, a bipartisan group of senators confirmed they are in the early stages of crafting legislation that would shore up the Electoral Count Act. Senate and House Minority Leaders Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy both seemed to endorse the effort on Thursday, as did White House press secretary Jen Psaki-though she maintained it's \"not a substitute\" for larger reforms.\n\nThe Biden administration on Thursday sanctioned two current Ukrainian officials and two former Ukrainian officials for acting as \"pawns\" of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) and participating in a \"global influence campaign to destabilize sovereign countries in support of the Kremlin's political objectives.\"\n\nThe Department of Justice announced Thursday federal prosecutors had charged four Belarusian government officials with conspiracy to commit aircraft piracy for their role in fabricating a bomb threat last spring that forced a RyanAir plane to land in Minsk so local law enforcement could arrest a dissident journalist onboard. The four Belarus-based individuals remain at large and will likely not be tried, but Thursday's charges will severely restrict where they can travel without facing extradition.\n\nPolice in the United Kingdom arrested two men on Thursday in connection with Malik Faisal Akram's hostage-taking at a Dallas-area synagogue last weekend. FBI Director Chris Wray said yesterday the law enforcement agency is treating the incident as an act of terrorism. \"This was not some random occurrence,\" Wray said. \"It was intentional, it was symbolic, and we're not going to tolerate antisemitism in this country.\"\n\nA federal judge ruled on Thursday that the January 6 Select Committee does not have to return or destroy a Trump spokesman's financial records obtained through a subpoena. District Court Judge James Boasberg said he did not have the authority to tell Congress what to do with documents already in its possession, and that, even if he did, the subpoena in question was not overly broad and the committee had a legitimate legislative purpose for issuing it.\n\nThe January 6 Select Committee announced yesterday it is seeking voluntary cooperation from Ivanka Trump in an effort to learn more about her father's attempts to persuade Vice President Mike Pence to participate in his plan to overturn the election and what the former president was doing the afternoon of January 6.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Thursday that union membership in the United States declined to near-record lows in 2021. About 14 million workers-10.3 percent of the labor force-belonged to unions last year, down 0.5 percentage points from 2020. Approximately 34 percent of public-sector workers were unionized, compared to about 6 percent of private-sector workers.\n\nThe Labor Department reported Thursday that initial jobless claims increased by 55,000 week-over-week to 286,000 last week, the highest number since October.\n\nMaura Healey, Massachusetts' Democratic attorney general, announced Thursday she is mounting a gubernatorial bid to succeed Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, who is not running for reelection this year.\n\nMaking use of both carrots and sticks, the United States and its fellow NATO member countries have worked tirelessly over the past few months to patch together an amalgam of sanctions, concessions, and diplomatic promises that, in combination, could convince Russian President Vladimir Putin to back down from his threat to re-invade Ukraine. It's proven difficult, with even the harshest warnings failing to deter the steady buildup of weaponry and troops-127,000, per the latest Ukrainian intelligence -along the countries' shared border.\n\nIt didn't get any easier on Wednesday. \"We've had very frank discussions, Vladimir Putin and I,\" President Joe Biden told reporters when asked about disagreements within the military alliance. \"And the idea that NATO is not going to be united, I don't buy. ... I think what you're going to see is that Russia will be held accountable if it invades. And it depends on what it does. It's one thing if it's a minor incursion and then we end up having a fight about what to do and not do.\"\n\nThe admission-which Biden expounded upon later in the press conference, publicly conceding there are \"differences\" in NATO countries' willingness to stand up to Putin's aggression-set off shockwaves in Washington, Kyiv, and, likely, Moscow. The White House scrambled to clarify Biden's remarks-a Wednesday press release asserted any Russian military movement across the Ukrainian border would be met with \"a swift, severe, and united response from the United States and [its] Allies\" and Biden himself said Thursday morning there is \"no doubt\" Russia will pay a \"heavy price\" for any further aggression-but the damage was done.\n\nIn those Thursday morning comments, Biden made clear that what he meant by \"minor incursions\" from Russia a day earlier were cyberattacks and paramilitary invasions-think the \" little green men \" of 2014's Crimea annexation. But Ukraine is plenty worried about those \"gray-zone\" attacks as well. \"We want to remind the great powers that there are no minor incursions and small nations,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted Thursday . \"Just as there are no minor casualties and little grief from the loss of loved ones.\"\n\nBiden's \"minor incursions\" remark generated the most news, but what came next may have been even more damaging. \"It wasn't only the comment that he made, but the fact that he qualified it by saying that there would be fighting within NATO. He openly acknowledged that NATO is not on the same page,\" Peter Dickinson-the Ukraine-based editor of the Atlantic Council's UkraineAlert-told The Dispatch , describing Biden's comments as \"disastrously revealing.\"\n\nBut whether the president openly copped to their existence or not, NATO's divisions were bound to come to the fore-and they have this week. On Wednesday, French President Emmanuel Macron called on the European Union to \"conduct [its] own dialogue\" with Russia separate from NATO and the United States. And in a joint press conference with Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock dodged a question about her country's willingness to halt the operations of Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline in the event of an invasion, despite the Biden administration repeatedly pointing to the project as leverage with which to shape Russia's behavior.\n\nDickinson explained why Baerbock may be waffling. \"If the worst comes to the worst and the Russians do attack-if they destroy or seriously damage Ukraine's gas transit system-the Germans will be faced with a choice,\" he said. \"Do they accept the Nord Stream 2 pipeline-do they certify, do they allow it to enter into service-or do they freeze? Do they do without gas? There's no third option.\"\n\nBlinken has spent most of this week in Europe, meeting with the Ukrainians on Wednesday and Germans on Thursday. Today, he'll sit down with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Geneva, Switzerland, for what could be one last-ditch effort to find a \" diplomatic off-ramp \" before things start to get truly messy. But Biden admitted Wednesday his \"guess\" is that Putin will move on Ukraine at some point, and experts agreed there's little Blinken can do today to budge him from that course.\n\nDmitri Alperovitch, the Russian-born co-founder of both CrowdStrike and the Silverado Policy Accelerator, told The Dispatch yesterday there is \"very little hope for a breakthrough\" at today's talks. \"I think they've decided in Moscow that, to accomplish all the objectives that they're desiring-which is the end to NATO expansion in the former Soviet Union space, the end to Ukraine's flirtation with NATO and support by NATO, and the resolution to the Donbass-the only way they can get them is through invasion,\" he said.\n\nThe most pertinent questions, then, are starting to begin with a when and not an if . \"[Putin's] got these forces that he's got to do something with,\" said Jim Townsend, former deputy assistant secretary of defense for European and NATO policy. \"They can't stay on high readiness forever. They will begin to deteriorate in terms of their capability.\"\n\nRussian officials announced Tuesday an unspecified number of troops would be deployed to Belarus for \"major war games,\" but the Biden administration isn't buying it. \"This is neither an exercise nor normal troop movement,\" a senior State Department official told reporters this week. \"It is a show of strength designed to cause or give false pretext for a crisis as Russia plans for a possible invasion. And let's be clear: This is extremely dangerous. We are now at a stage where Russia could, at any point, launch an attack on Ukraine.\"\n\nAlperovitch was \"very fearful\" of a Belarus deployment-because he sees the strategy behind it. \"They now have an option to surround Kyiv without having to cross the Dnieper [River],\" he said. \"Even if they don't [go] after Kyiv, they can force the Ukrainians to defend across a 500 kilometer line of engagement; spreading their resources across the east, the west, the south, and the north and making resistance very, very difficult.\"\n\nThe Kremlin continues to deny such plans, with Sergey Nechaev, its ambassador to Berlin, describing the move as \"normal\" preparation for joint military exercises. \"We are reacting to the fact that our Western negotiating partners are flooding Ukraine with weapons,\" he added. \"These weapons are construed by the West as defensive, but they can be turned into offensive ones very quickly.\"\n\nBritish Defense Secretary Ben Wallace announced Monday the United Kingdom had begun supplying Ukraine with \"light, anti-armor defensive weapons systems,\" and Biden said Wednesday the United States has already shipped over $600 million worth of defensive equipment. It'll be enough to make Russia's increasingly likely invasion more costly, but not enough to stop it.\n\n\"The Ukrainians are going to encounter one of the most well-armed militaries on the planet, and one that has enormous capacity to deliver long-range fires,\" Alperovitch said. \"Russians are going to bring down absolute hell on Ukrainian defensive positions-with long-range artillery, with fixed-wing aircraft, with ballistic missiles-and there is nothing in the Ukrainian arsenal to stop any of that.\"\n\nOleksiy Danilov-a senior Ukrainian defense official- told the Wall Street Journal yesterday he believes Russia will ultimately back down from a large-scale military incursion and opt instead to undermine Ukrainian leadership with cyberattacks, economic pressure, and disinformation campaigns. But Ukraine's Defense Ministry announced on Tuesday it was mobilizing 130,000 reservists to bolster its 246,000-troop active duty military. James Heappey, British armed forces minister, said this week he believes tens of thousands of people could die in the conflict.\n\n\"[The Ukrainians] can't physically stop Russia from invading,\" Dickinson said. \"But what they can do-and what they plan to do openly-is fight a prolonged guerrilla campaign, which they are very well-equipped to do. ... They're very motivated because they're fighting in their own country against an enemy who is openly seeking to destroy them, seeking to deny their right to exist as an independent country.\"\n\nIn his Wednesday press conference, President Biden repeatedly blamed Republican obstructionism for his administration's lack of progress on a number of different issues. \"Did any of you think that you'd get to a point where not a single Republican would diverge on a major issue? Not one?\" he asked the press corps. But as Marc Thiessen points out in his latest column , that's not exactly true. Senate Republicans offered to cooperate on a COVID-19 relief bill; Biden rejected their proposal after one meeting. Nearly 20 Senate Republicans-and about a dozen in the House-broke with Donald Trump's wishes and gave Biden a win on infrastructure, which he almost frittered away by tethering the legislation to his much more ambitious Build Back Better Act. Republicans have signaled a willingness to work with Democrats to update the Electoral Count Act, but the White House has thus far dismissed those efforts as insufficient compared to Democrats' more aggressive election reforms.\n\nIn The Atlantic , science writer Ed Yong explains why an idea gaining traction online-denying medical care to unvaccinated people-is an unabashedly terrible one. \"People whose actions endangered themselves, like smokers with lung cancer or drivers who crash while not wearing a seatbelt, still get treated. Those whose actions endangered others, like drunk drivers or terrorists, also get treated,\" he writes. \"'We are all sinners,' Carla Keirns, a professor of medical ethics and palliative medicine at the University of Kansas Medical Center, told me. 'No one has made all the perfect decisions, and any of us could find ourselves in a situation where we are sick.'\"\n\nPolitical and corporate participation in the 2022 Winter Olympics-already morally reprehensible-has grown even more indefensible in recent days, Josh Rogin notes in his latest Washington Post column . \"In a news conference this week, a top Beijing Organizing Committee official said, 'Any behavior or speech that is against the Olympic spirit, especially against the Chinese laws and regulations, are also subject to certain punishment.' On Tuesday, the nonprofit research organization Citizen Lab released a report revealing that the Chinese government has mandated that all Olympics athletes download a 'health monitoring' app that is riddled with security vulnerabilities that puts their data and conversations at risk,\" Rogin writes. \"Corporations don't seem ashamed at all. ... By both action and inaction, they are helping the Chinese government cover up its repression, mainly because it is in their financial interest.\"\n\nThe committee also has a text from Sean Hannity to press secretary Kayleigh McEnany proposing to warn Trump that he risked being removed via the \"25th amendment\" if he persisted in claiming the election was stolen.\n\nMcEnany replied: \"Love that. Thank you. That is the playbook.\" pic.twitter.com/CTQ85fEZ3u\n\n- Christian Vanderbrouk 🇺🇸🇮🇱🇺🇦 (@UrbanAchievr) January 20, 2022\n\nEconomist deputy editor Edward Carr joined Jonah on yesterday's Remnant for a discussion of how the pandemic has affected nations outside the United States.

      "text": "AI Infiltrates the 2024 Race\n\nPlus: IRS whistleblowers testify before Congress on the Hunter Biden probe.\n\nHappy Thursday! Yesterday was National Hot Dog Day, which gave Sen. Mitt Romney more than enough reason to roam the halls of Congress wearing a hot dog hat and holding a hot dog while declaring that \"hot dog is [his] favorite meat.\"\n\nEarlier this week, a Ron DeSantis-aligned super PAC released a 30-second ad in Iowa detailing former President Donald Trump's spat with the state's popular Republican governor, Kim Reynolds. \"I endorsed her, did big rallies, and when she won, now she wants to remain 'neutral,'\" Trump says before a narrator asks why he's fighting with his fellow Republicans. It's a fair hit-several GOP strategists in Iowa think it will cost Trump -but there's just one problem with the ad. Trump never said those words-he Truthed them .\n\nHarnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI), the DeSantis super PAC Never Back Down was able to generate realistic-sounding audio of Trump reading his own written statement aloud. And it wasn't the first time. Last month, the DeSantis campaign released a video going after Trump for his refusal to fire Dr. Anthony Fauci during the pandemic-and the spot included fake, AI-generated images of the former president hugging the famous immunologist. When President Joe Biden announced his reelection campaign in April, the Republican National Committee released an AI-generated video depicting several apocalyptic-looking scenes and warning another Biden term would make them a reality. And lest you think this is a purely Republican phenomenon, an audio deepfake released the day before the Chicago mayoral election earlier this year portrayed the less progressive Democratic candidate in the Chicago Mayoral election as condoning police brutality.\n\nSome days, we're inspired by Congress' example of democracy in action.\n\nOther days, we watch a six-hour hearing about Hunter Biden complete with lewd posters of the first son-which we won't be describing in detail, because our moms read this newsletter. Thank you, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nIRS whistleblower Gary Shapley and his deputy Joseph Ziegler -previously known only as \"whistleblower X\"-testified under oath before the GOP-led House Committee on Oversight and Accountability yesterday that IRS investigators and Department of Justice officials skirted normal procedure to treat Hunter Biden with inappropriate lenience. The hearing elicited little new information, but the whistleblowers' claims of wrongdoing provided Republicans an opportunity to draw attention to their allegations of corruption against the Biden family and lay into Attorney General Merrick Garland.\n\nWe've reported previously on the basic contours of Shapley and Ziegler's accusations. Both claim higher-ups slow-walked the process, tipped off Hunter's legal team to developments, and discouraged the IRS team from investigating the possible involvement of Hunter Biden's family-including Joe Biden and his grandchildren-in the first son's business dealings. \"When the subject's father is somehow related to the finances of the subject, in the normal course of any investigation, we would have to get that information, to properly vet the financial flows of money, and determine what we end up charging,\" Shapley said, claiming that didn't happen because a DOJ official said it would \"get us into hot water.\"\n\nThis alleged obstruction of the investigation has left outstanding questions, the two IRS officials said. For instance, when investigators dug up an alleged text message from Hunter Biden to a Chinese businessman claiming his father was sitting with him and would hold a grudge unless Hunter got paid, the natural next step would be to check location data to verify whether the former vice president was with his son at the time. The IRS officials said they weren't allowed to access the location information needed to vet the story.\n\nHunter reached a deal last month to plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges and enter a diversion program (similar to probation) for a felony firearm offense related to his gun ownership as an active drug user. But Shapley and Ziegler argue Hunter should have faced harsher charges-including felony tax charges, not just misdemeanors, in California and Washington, D.C., in addition to Delaware-and that contrary to Garland's claims, U.S. Attorney David Weiss didn't have freedom to do so. Shapley alleged Weiss said in an October 2022 meeting that he didn't have the power to decide whether to file charges outside his jurisdiction in Delaware, a claim both Garland and Weiss deny.\n\nShapley contested their denials-he claims to have email conversations corroborating his account-but hedged his accusation. \"Although these facts contradict Attorney General Garland's testimony and raise serious questions for you to investigate, I have never claimed to have evidence that Attorney General Garland knowingly lied to Congress,\" he said Wednesday.\n\nZiegler backed Shapley's description. \"It appeared to me, based on what I experienced, that the U.S. attorney in Delaware in our investigation was constantly hamstrung, limited, and marginalized by DOJ officials as well as other U.S. attorneys,\" he told lawmakers. Ziegler also alleged he had collected evidence Hunter improperly claimed business deductions for personal expenses, including college tuition, escorts, and a \"sex club.\"\n\nDemocrats on the committee, meanwhile, suggested Hunter's final plea deal was simply the result of prosecutorial discretion, not wrongdoing. \"A lot of your testimony,\" argued Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, is about \"the traditional tug of war\" between investigators and prosecutors, \"who are more attuned to the rigors of the courtroom.\" Democratic lawmakers also pointed out that Weiss is a Trump appointee-though Trump nominated him on the recommendation of Delaware's two Democratic senators.\n\nRepublicans took special care to burnish the whistleblowers' credibility and criticize Weiss for his repeated statements disputing the whistleblowers' narrative about his role in the charging decisions. \"The Justice Department can't get their story straight,\" said House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan. \"I'll believe these guys. I think they're the ones telling the truth. And that is fundamentally what this comes down to.\" Democrats noted they want to hear Weiss' account of events-he has said he's willing to testify, though Congress and the DOJ are still negotiating a date.\n\nRepublicans used the hours-long hearing to level a number of unrelated accusations against Hunter-Greene at one point accused him of \"making pornography\"-but the GOP lawmakers underlined to the core point that investigators hadn't been permitted to find out if the president was caught up in his son's misdeeds. \"He sold access to his father, the big guy,\" said Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana. \"You Americans out there may have a compromised president in your White House. You should certainly be concerned.\"\n\nBut Democrats also went on the attack during the hearing, questioning whether Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump engaged in the same kind of influence peddling of which Republicans accuse Hunter. And while Republicans repeated that Shapley and Ziegler are \"credible,\" Democrats reminded them of Gal Luft, a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen who alleged Hunter had a mole inside the FBI and that the Biden family received payments from Chinese nationals with intelligence ties-before himself being indicted on charges of lobbying without registration, violating sanctions, and brokering arms deals with Iran and China.\n\nEven if Republican lawmakers can't find enough evidence against Joe Biden to win their game of pin-the-crime-on-the-president, some seem eager to pursue another target: Garland. \"Weiss must provide answers to the House Judiciary Committee,\" House Speaker Kevin McCarthy tweeted Sunday. \"If the whistleblowers' allegations are true, this will be a significant part of a larger impeachment inquiry into Merrick Garland's weaponization of DOJ.\"\n\nPolitico : New Jersey Man Commuted by Trump Charged in New Fraud Scheme\n\nAfter learning about Shapley and Ziegler's testimonies before lawmakers, do you find their allegations surrounding the Hunter Biden case more or less credible?\n\nDeclan Garvey is the executive editor at the Dispatch and is based in Washington, D.C.

      "text": "How to Think About Party Dissolution\n\nRealignment is a more likely outcome than a major party imploding.\n\nWhen we talk about America's political parties today, there seem to be just two: Democrats and Republicans. This is all the more amazing given widespread dissatisfaction among voters, a majority of whom don't want to see a Trump-Biden rematch in 2024. Yet most analysts still claim that a third-party run is simply impossible and that Americans are destined to be held hostage by the two feuding parties.\n\nBut this is a narrow view of U.S. history. In fact, over the past 225 years, there have been a host of parties (and third parties), including: the Federalists, the Whigs, the Greenback Party, the Know-Nothing Party, the Liberty Party, the Free-Soil Party, the Anti-Masonic Party, the Bull Moose/Progressive Party, the Independent Party, and the National Republican Party. Some have had brief tenures, some longer, but the fact that we have had so many speaks to the possibility that America might not be a Republican or Democrat duopoly forever.\n\nParties fall because of internal contradictions that prevent them from confronting external events. The Federalists were never able to build support outside the Northeast in the aftermath of the War of 1812. The Whigs, in contrast, could not reconcile the conflict between Northern and Southern party members over slavery. In other words, the Whigs could not sustain being a national party with internal contradictions, while the Federalists could not overcome being a regional party.\n\nOther parties rose to tackle a national issue that had been insufficiently addressed by the other two parties. The Know Nothings were anti-immigration, for example; the Anti-Masonic Party was, as the name suggests, anti-Mason; and Ross Perot secured 19 percent of the popular vote, but zero electoral votes, with his message about our unsustainable debt-about $4 trillion at the time, roughly an eighth of what it is today.\n\nWhat might this history mean for Democrats and Republicans today? We've certainly had our share of national tumult in the short two decades of the 21st century, starting with the 9/11 attacks, continuing with the 2008 financial collapse, and most recently the COVID pandemic. And we also face the threat of other potential external shake-ups, be it war with increasingly belligerent adversaries or a financial collapse based on our massive and growing debt.\n\nWhile there is a possibility of these external events shaking up our parties, it is not a certainty. The parties have survived the tumultuous 21st century thus far, albeit in a weakened state. This weakening has multiple causes, including the McCain-Feingold financing rules that diminished their fundraising power and the rise of social media platforms that allowed individual politicians to develop their own communications apparatuses outside of the parties' superstructures.\n\nIn a duopoly, though, even weak parties are hard to supplant. What is far more common, and probably more likely, is continued realignment. The truth is that the Democrats and Republicans do change regularly, both in position and in the nature of their supporters. Black voters, for example, were solid Republicans for almost a century after the Civil War, but they have been solid Democrats for the half-century since. Southern whites moved as well. When Lyndon Johnson passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, he told aide Bill Moyers, \"Well, I think we may have lost the South for your lifetime-and mine.\"\n\nSouthern GOP dominance has gone on for even longer than Johnson predicted. However, we are now seeing cracks in that foundation, with North Carolina and Georgia becoming increasingly purple in recent elections.\n\nThe Catholic vote was once seen as something that politicians could win or lose, but now Catholics pretty much vote as the country does. Democrats were once the pro-Israel party. Now, Republicans are seen as more pro-Israel. As the demographics of the party shift, so does their issue mix.\n\nThe biggest disruptions within the parties take place as a result of the quadrennial presidential primary process. Whoever takes over the party by winning the primaries puts his or her stamp on it. If they win the general election, the stamp gets darker and deeper. If they win reelection, they can define their party for a decade or even a generation. We have seen this phenomenon take place multiple times over the last century. Franklin Delano Roosevelt created an unwieldy but powerful coalition of rural whites, labor, urban ethnics, and enough blacks to win the presidency four times. Dwight Eisenhower did well with both blacks and upper-class whites. John F. Kennedy wrested the black vote from the Republicans in part by calling Martin Luther King's wife while King was languishing in prison. Ronald Reagan's coalition brought formerly Democratic urban ethnics over to the Republicans with an issue mix that included tax cuts, a strong stance on crime, and opposition to the Soviet Union. Republicans successfully wielded those issues for a generation, but those issues lost their resonance in the 1990s-and since then Republicans have won the popular vote for the presidency only once.\n\nToday, both parties struggle with unpopular standard bearers who nevertheless appear likely to win their respective nominations once again. Republican struggles with Trump have been quite clear through four consecutive election defeats-the 2018 midterms, the 2020 presidential election, the 2020 Georgia Senate sweep, and the disappointing 2022 midterms. Trump has indeed brought a different demographic look to the Republican Party, attracting high percentages of rural and lower-educated whites as well as Hispanics, while driving college-educated voters into the arms of the Democratic Party. In addition, his issue mix is not always clear, as it seems so dependent on his own particular whims and preferences of the time. One of the reasons his White House was so fractious was that there were three groups that could all plausibly claim to be representing the true Trump: the MAGA-ites like Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller; the traditional Republicans like Larry Kudlow and Reince Priebus; and the globalists, like Gary Cohn, Jared Kushner, and Ivanka Trump.\n\nTrump was well aware of these fault lines. That's why in 2020 he did not allow an official GOP platform, so that he and the party could not be pinned down on specific issues. Although the Republican Party does still seem to favor Trump, it's quite clear that his bundle of issues may change again-and it is entirely possible he will alter course on an issue that fragments his supporters. What's inarguable is that when he exits the stage, the GOP will have to reestablish what principles will guide its policies in the future.\n\nAs for the Democrats, they may have even greater challenges ahead after Biden leaves national politics. He successfully held the Democratic coalition together in 2020, running mainly as an anti-Trump candidate. Going forward, though, the Democrats face a host of serious internal contradictions that will be made more apparent once Trump is no longer their bete noire . Do they want to be the party of the woke, which drives away middle America and non-elite voters, or do they want to do a Bill Clinton and engage moderate voters, thereby risking denunciation by the loud woke voices in the party and the media?\n\nWhen I served in the George W. Bush administration, his constant refrain was that he was fighting against the forces of nativism, isolationism, and protectionism. Trump-supporting Republicans certainly do not speak that way today, but it was only 15 years ago that Bush was the party head and largely popular with Republican voters. These things can change rapidly, especially in the aftermath of a contested primary in which a new face or voice emerges as the party head. All the people who are talking about a new party emerging are correct in this way: The parties are likely to change a great deal in the course of the 2020s. It's just that their names will most likely still be the Democratic and Republican parties.\n\nTevi Troy is a senior fellow at the Ronald Reagan Institute, a senior scholar at Yeshiva University's Straus Center, and a former deputy secretary of HHS and senior White House aide.

(AP) - Donors are pushing Kansas' higher education board to fire Wichita State University's president after he canceled a virtual speech by Ivanka Trump for its technical school's graduation .\n\nThe Kansas Board of Regents scheduled a special meeting Wednesday to discuss what it called \"personnel matters.\" Its staff did not say more, but the meeting comes only two days after a former board member from Wichita said the regents should ask for President Jay Golden's resignation.\n\nGolden canceled Trump's speech after students and faculty protested . Students staged an impromptu rally Wednesday to support him.\n\nCOLLEGE BOARD SUSPENDS SAT REGISTRATION OUTSIDE NORTH AMERICA, CITES 'BOT' ACTIVITY\n\nSteve Clark, the former regent seeking Golden's ouster, sent a letter Monday to board members saying Golden's decision to cancel the speech by President Donald Trump's daughter threatens a multimillion-dollar relationship with Koch Industries, the vast conglomerate led by billionaire and conservative political donor Charles Koch, The Wichita Eagle reports. A Koch Industries spokeswoman said Wednesday that financial commitments to the university are being honored and, while it opposes canceling speakers, it doesn't tie funding to university employment actions.\n\nClark is the chairman and CEO of a Wichita investment firm who served as chairman of search committees for both Golden and his predecessor, John Bardo. Golden became president in January, after Bardo died in March 2019.\n\nClark told the regents that officials from Koch Industries and several longtime donors and supporters are \"very upset and quite vocal in their decisions to disavow any further support.\" He said canceling Trump's speech damaged the school's reputation with high-profile donors.\n\n\"These relationships can only be restored by Dr. Golden's departure,\" he wrote the regents. \"I would strongly encourage you not to let this linger.\"\n\nSteve Feilmeier, Koch Industries' executive vice president and chief financial officer, said he's been asked to serve on the Wichita State Foundation board and how the speech controversy is resolved will \"weigh heavily\" on his decision.\n\nGRADUATIONS, CAMPUS CLASSES CANCELED BY CORONAVIRUS SHOCK COLLEGE-TOWN ECONOMY\n\nThe university has said Koch Industries and its associated foundations have spent or pledged to spend more than $15 million there in the past seven years. Company spokeswoman Jessica Koehn said it respects \"the university's independence\" in making employment decisions.\n\nBut she also said Koch Industries believes canceling speakers \"cuts off the chance to engage, debate, and criticize.\"\n\nWichita State has 14,000 students, including some 3,000 at its technical school and is home to a national institute on aviation research. Parts of Wichita and its suburbs are politically conservative, and Donald Trump carried the county in 2016 by 18 percentage points. Ivanka Trump visited WSU Tech last fall to promote its training programs.\n\nThe university announced Thursday that she would give a virtual speech for WSU Tech's graduation and canceled it hours later after a professor's open letter of protest garnered nearly 500 signatures.\n\nDays earlier, police under federal command in Washington used tear gas to force back a peaceful protests of George Floyd's death in Minneapolis while detained by police. The police action allowed the president to walk to a church near the White House and pose with a Bible, accompanied by his daughter. The president also threatened to use the military to quell violence.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nWSU Tech President Sheree Utash later apologized, calling the timing of the announcement of Ivanka Trump's speech \"insensitive.\" Golden has said the university is committed to diversity and that he canceled the speech to avoid a distraction from celebrating the students.\n\nIvanka Trump responded by tweeting a link to her remarks and saying universities should be \"bastions of free speech.\"\n\n\"Cancel culture and viewpoint discrimination are antithetical to academia,\" she said.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a former Wichita-area congressman, called the cancellation \"shameful,\" adding in a statement: \"The losers here are freedom of thought, the students, and the central idea of universities as places of tolerance and learning.\"\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nIvanka Trump is gathering governors, business leaders and administration officials in the White House on Thursday to push for action on an issue she hopes both sides of the aisle can come together on: paid parental leave.\n\nTrump, whose official title is Senior Advisor to the President, described the summit as an avenue for \"substantive discussion.\"\n\nAFL-CIO ENDORSES USMCA AS 'VAST IMPROVEMENT' OVER NAFTA\n\n\"Tomorrow will mark a key moment within the Trump administration where private, public and community leaders will come together to discuss a key issue in our country - how best to support working families,\" Trump told FOX Business in a statement. \"This has been a priority of the administration's since the early days of the campaign and the President has delivered on one promise after another. Under his leadership, American working families have never had a brighter future.\"\n\nPresident Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar will be Ivanka Trump's co-hosts for the event. The administration touts that the president has spoken about guaranteeing paid family leave nationwide as far back as his February 2017 speech to a joint session of Congress .\n\nWhite House adviser Ivanka Trump speaks on Oct. 3, 2019, in Dallas, Texas, after Google announced it is committing to a White House initiative designed to get private companies to expand job training. (Photo by Ron Jenkins/Getty Images)\n\nIvanka Trump has praised legislation that will give more than two million federal workers access to 12 weeks of paid leave after they give birth, as well as foster or adopt a child. The bill, spearheaded by Rep. Carolyn Maloney , D-N.Y., is expected to pass attached to the National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nHeritage Foundation researcher Rachel Greszler is set to attend the summit after testifying before Congress on the issue Tuesday. She told FOX Business it could be difficult to drum up Republican support for the kind of national policy Ivanka Trump is pushing for.\n\n\"One of the most important questions for any federal paid family leave proposal - one that's too often overlooked - is would this proposal actually benefit the people policymakers are trying to help?\" Greszler said.\n\n\"A one-size-fits-all federal program will leave workers worse off with unintended consequences, such as hiring discrimination against, and lower pay and promotions for women,\" Greszler said. \"Policymakers should work toward solutions that will increase access to paid family leave without enacting a new national entitlement unsuited to meet the real needs of workers.\"\n\nHowever, Ivanka Trump has seen fruit from her meeting with Republican Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Joni Ernst of Iowa, Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah in February.\n\nRubio, along with Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Mo., introduced legislation in March allowing parents to pull forward up to three months of those retirement benefits to use for leave following the birth or adoption of a child. The bill is an updated version of legislation he introduced in 2018.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nWhite House adviser Ivanka Trump and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will present the inaugural Pledge to America's Workers Presidential Awards to companies including Volkswagen Group of America and Lockheed Martin at the White House on Wednesday.\n\n\"Through the White House's Pledge to America's Workers, the Trump administration challenged the private sector to make a major investment in the education and training of their workers to ensure Americans have the skills necessary to remain the best in the world,\" Ivanka Trump said in a statement. \"On behalf of the President, I am honored to award nine extraordinary organizations the Pledge to America's Workers Award for their commitment to the exceptionalism of the American worker and for their steadfast resolve to equip their employees with the tools to succeed in the jobs of today and tomorrow.\"\n\nIVANKA TRUMP, GM'S MARY BARRA VISIT AUTOMAKER'S MICHIGAN TECHNICAL TRAINING FACILITY\n\nThe seven other companies being recognized range from the hospitality industry to aerospace defense . They are the American Hotel & Lodging Association, Associated Builders and Contractors, the National Retail Federation, Northrop Grumman, Oberg Industries, Textron and Zurich North America.\n\n\"We are honored to receive the Pledge to America's Workers Presidential Award during a time when supporting our workforce has never been more critical,\" Chip Rogers, head of the American Hotel & Lodging Association, said in a statement. \"Our industry is doing all we can to survive, and yet, we are resilient and committed to advancing our workforce by expanding the work of the AHLA Foundation, our career development programs, and scholarship grants to help our employees get one step ahead once travel resumes.\"\n\nMost of the recipients have pledged to offer thousands or hundreds of thousands of training opportunities. For example, Lockheed Martin pledged $100 million over five years to employee training and education after signing the Pledge to America's Workers in 2018.\n\nThe administration is also touting the Associated Builders and Contractors, which pledged to educate at least 500,000 construction workers starting in 2018, for overshooting its goal and investing $1.5 billion to educate more than 1.1 million course attendees.\n\nDaughter and adviser of President Donald Trump, Ivanka Trump waves to the crowd as she arrives to participate in the Phoenix Business Roundtable with Arizona Gov.

In addition, the Associated Builders and Contractors' Chicago-focused Community Builders Program specializes in preparing students with no prior experience to get jobs as skilled craftsmen.\n\nLockheed Martin Executive Chairman Marillyn Hewson and IBM Executive Chairman Ginni Rometty are expected to attend the White House event. IBM is not one of the nine award recipients, but Rometty has worked closely with Trump on the White House's Workforce Policy Advisory Board. IBM is expected to share more about its use of blockchain technology to create a digital credentialing system for workers, which Rometty detailed in a FOX Business op-ed earlier in September.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe administration conceived its jobs pledge long before the coronavirus pandemic and has pushed jobseekers to rethink the four-year degree pathway by emphasizing skills over degrees. However, the White House's American Workforce Policy Advisory Board took heat for its \" Find Something New \" job training campaign that launched in July amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe administration's \"Pledge to America's Workers\" encourages businesses and groups to create opportunities for workers, including apprenticeships, continuing education, on-the-job-training and retraining. More than 440 companies have signed the pledge, which the administration says translates to more than 16 million job training opportunities.\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

And my highest, most core value is family.\"\n\nIt comes after her sister-in-law, Lara Trump, recently addressed Ivanka's planned absence during Trump's second administration, telling The Post the first White House stint was tough on their young family.\n\n\"Jared and Ivanka obviously were very, very much involved during the first term and it was really tough on them,\" Lara, wife of Eric Trump, said.\n\n\"You know, every time we saw them, that was the constant - it was tough on them. It was tough on their family,\" she added.\n\n\"I think they actually did some really incredible things, things for which they may never get credit, but they definitely deserve some.\"\n\nElsewhere in the wide-ranging interview, Ivanka described her past experience in the White House as a \"very emotional time.\"\n\n\"You become a little bit calloused,\" she said.\n\nStill, Ivanka said her time in the White House was a time of \"extraordinary personal growth for me and learning.\"\n\n\"In retrospect I was able to break free of a bubble that I didn't even know that I was in of the sort of Upper East Side of New York,\" she said.\n\n\"I went through years of craziness, and I've never become cynical about I think the fundamental goodness of people,\" Ivanka added.\n\n\"Hopefully I'll live a life that continues to be impactful, regardless of where I do it.\"\n\nAdvertisement"

And unfortunately, the two are not separable,\" Ivanka, 43, said, adding it is a \"very dark, negative business.\"\n\n\"There is a darkness to that world that I don't really want to welcome into mine,\" she continued.\n\n\"To some degree, I'm at the center of the storm because my father is about to be president, but it's a very dark, negative business. And some people love the gladiator aspect of it - the fight. That was never me.\"\n\nIvanka - who relocated to Florida with her husband , Jared Kushner, and their three kids after Trump's 2020 election loss - said she still plans to \"show up\" for her dad as he makes his return next week.\n\n\"I think I'm most looking forward to just being able to show up for him as a daughter and be there for him to take his mind off things, to watch a movie with him, or watch a sports game,\" she said.\n\n\"To know that he can be with me, and be himself and just relax and for me to be able to provide that for him in a very loving way as his daughter.\"\n\n\"It's the world's loneliest position - the enormity of the decisions you're making on a daily basis, how transactional everyone is with you,\" she added.\n\nTrump's daughter, who was a constant presence by her dad's side during his first administration, insisted she \"did love the impact\" of her White House adviser role - but her decision not to return was rooted in making her family a priority.\n\n\"The main reason I am not going back to serve now is I know the cost, and it's a price that I'm not willing to make my kids bear,\" she said.\n\n\"My primary goals were just to like, be the best freaking mom,\" the former first daughter said elsewhere in the interview. \"It's hard. I mean, I did the best I could - and I think I was there for all the really critical moments - but you don't want to miss the small ones either.\"\n\n\"Every time I had to miss something, I'm like, 'I will never let this happen again in the minute I leave the White House'.\"\n\nAsked if she's received pushback for opting not to rejoin her dad's incoming administration, Ivanka said: \"It really feels like it's very easy to make a decision when it aligns around your core values. And my highest, most core value is family.\"\n\nIt comes after her sister-in-law, Lara Trump, recently addressed Ivanka's planned absence during Trump's second administration, telling The Post the first White House stint was tough on their young family.\n\n\"Jared and Ivanka obviously were very, very much involved during the first term and it was really tough on them,\" Lara, wife of Eric Trump, said.\n\n\"You know, every time we saw them, that was the constant - it was tough on them. It was tough on their family,\" she added.\n\n\"I think they actually did some really incredible things, things for which they may never get credit, but they definitely deserve some.\"\n\nElsewhere in the wide-ranging interview, Ivanka described her past experience in the White House as a \"very emotional time.\"\n\n\"You become a little bit calloused,\" she said.\n\nStill, Ivanka said her time in the White House was a time of \"extraordinary personal growth for me and learning.\"\n\n\"In retrospect I was able to break free of a bubble that I didn't even know that I was in of the sort of Upper East Side of New York,\" she said.\n\n\"I went through years of craziness, and I've never become cynical about I think the fundamental goodness of people,\" Ivanka added.\n\n\"Hopefully I'll live a life that continues to be impactful, regardless of where I do it.\"\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Jared Kushner says 'zero' chance of seeing Ivanka Trump on father's campaign trail\n\nJared Kushner said there is a \"zero\" chance he and his wife, Ivanka Trump , will join his father-in-law, former President Donald Trump , on the campaign trail less than a week before Election Day.\n\nKushner, who runs a $3 billion private equity fund partnering with the governments of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar, said he and his wife will continue to be removed from politics if the former president is elected.\n\n\"We're rooting for him - obviously, we're proud of him,\" Kushner told the New York Times . \"But, you know, either way, our life will just continue to move forward.\"\n\nAside from attending the Republican National Convention this summer, Ivanka Trump was absent from her father's campaign trail this election. She also didn't make an appearance at his hush money trial in New York, where he was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business.\n\nThis is a stark contrast to her previous involvement in her father's past two campaigns and even landing a position in his administration, which forced her to relinquish her holdings in several of her clothing and jewelry lines that, eventually, were dropped by retail stores.\n\nIn 2022, right after her father's campaign announcement, Ivanka Trump said she had no plans to be involved in politics.\n\nKushner served as a senior adviser to Trump from 2017 to 2021, but he has also said he would not be returning for a second Trump administration.\n\nWhile Ivanka Trump has attended birthday parties for celebrities, such as Kim Kardashian, and Miami Formula One Race events, her sister-in-law, Lara Trump, has taken up the torch of leading women voters to the former president.\n\nAppointed Republican National Committee co-chairwoman earlier this year, Lara Trump has been at her father-in-law's side at rallies and town hall events and going to bat for him on major network TV interviews.\n\nHowever, Susan Del Percio, a Republican political strategist, shared with the New York Times that Ivanka Trump and former first lady Melania Trump's absence from the former president's side has remained telling to voters, who've wrestled with his sexual assault allegation and abortion stances. Melania Trump shared in her recently published memoir that she supports abortion access.\n\n\"The positives that she could make on the trail is marginal, but the fact that she and Melania are not on the trail could be significant,\" Del Percio said."

      "text": "Lara Trump doesn't 'blame' Ivanka and Jared Kushner for political step back\n\nEXCLUSIVE - Republican National Committee Co-chairwoman Lara Trump is adamant her family remains behind former President Donald Trump as she and husband Eric step up, becoming more prominent in national politics, while sister-in-law Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner , take a step back.\n\n\"We're all one big team,\" Lara Trump told the Washington Examiner from the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. \"Just because Ivanka and Jared are not fully out front right now does not reflect in any way any less support. We are all 100% behind him.\"\n\n\"They're going to be at the convention later this week,\" she said of her sister- and brother-in-law. \"You will see them here. It's just everybody, I think, has different seasons in life. I know that Jared and Ivanka are really proud of their time working in the White House . I think they made some amazing things happen during my father-in-law's administration. But it was tough. It was really tough on them. It was really tough on their family. I don't blame them at all for taking a bit of a backseat role at this point. I guess it's my turn to step up and do some things.\"\n\nLara Trump, herself a mother of two young children, was elected co-chairwoman of the RNC in March, alongside former North Carolina Republican Party Chairman Michael Whatley. A onetime television producer, Lara Trump has consistently expressed her support for the former president but, unlike Ivanka and Kushner, did so from a political, not official, capacity. Meanwhile, Eric Trump, her husband of 10 years, has focused on the old family business, the Trump Organization . Eric Trump, like his wife, has become a mainstay on television this week during the convention, appearing on more liberal-leaning outlets compared to his brother Donald Trump Jr.\n\nBut with the new family business being politics, the former president's adult children have become more concerned with securing their father's legacy, regardless of whether he secures a second term in November.\n\nLara Trump described the former president as upending politics and the Republican Party since he announced his 2016 campaign, contending \"he's welcomed so many people into our tent,\" particularly people who \"maybe never saw themselves as Republicans.\" By picking Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) as his vice presidential nominee, for example, her father-in-law tapped somebody who \"shares his same vision for this country,\" she said.\n\n\"They have a lot of similarities,\" the amateur recording artist said. \"But I think that J.D. is a good balance for him in a lot of ways. ... He started out very poor, obviously had substance abuse issues in his family. He can relate to a lot of the things that people in this country are struggling with right now. I think he brings that to this ticket as well.\"\n\n\"He wanted somebody who could carry on, maybe it's a legacy, but I really think it's just his vision for the future of this country, putting America first,\" she added. \"J.D. certainly is going to be the best person for that.\"\n\nTrump Jr. advocated publicly and privately for the former president to choose Vance as his running mate instead of a compromise selection, such as Gov. Doug Burgum (R-ND) or Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), as he and other advisers help position Donald Trump for the 2024 bid and post-presidency. Appeals to more establishment Republicans have been muted during the convention, with ex-U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley receiving a mixed reception.\n\nBoth Lara Trump and Trump Jr. have been rumored to be considering their own political careers, with Wyoming Republicans encouraging Trump Jr. to contest their state's Senate seat in 2020 before the Pennsylvania GOP did the same for their commonwealth's Senate seat in 2022. North Carolina Republicans made similar overtures to Lara Trump for their Senate seat that cycle too.\n\nMost recently, Barron Trump , his father's youngest and only child with third wife, former first lady Melania Trump , has become politically active, the crowd welcoming him to his first rally last week in Florida with a standing ovation.\n\n\"Man, they make it all so nice for us in politics. Why wouldn't we want to get more involved?\" Lara Trump joked. \"My father-in-law, I think, knew whenever he decided to come down that escalator in 2015 and announce he was running for president, this was so much bigger than him. He sat down actually with all of us as a family, and he said, 'Listen, I'm going to do this, but it's not just going to be about me. It's going to be about all of us.'\"\n\n\"I don't think any of us in those moments actually knew what that would look like,\" she said. \"For those of us in our family, it was really about getting out and pushing back on some of the character attacks on him. And here we are today. It's been sort of a natural, you know, ascent for so many of us in the family. I think that we are so proud to be by his side in this fight.\"\n\nDonald Trump closed the second night of the Republican convention on Tuesday by providing delegates on the floor and potential GOP voters watching at home with personal testimony about the former president, a previous responsibility of Ivanka Trump.\n\n\"When I look at Donald Trump, I see a wonderful father, father-in-law, and, of course, grandfather to my two young children, Luke and Carolina,\" Lara Trump said. \"It's through that lens that we sometimes wish more people could see this is a man who has sacrificed for his family and a man who has truly sacrificed for his country.\"\n\n\"I have seen this man dragged through hell and back,\" she continued, adding, \"Yet he has never backed down\" to chants of \"We love Trump.\" \"So tonight, to my father-in-law, I want to say thank you for your resilience, thank you for continuing on, thank you for raising wonderful kids, thank you for being an amazing grandfather, thank you for never giving up on me, and thank you for never giving up on our country.\""

      "text": "Ivanka Trump denies awareness of decade-old financial details in father's New York civil trial\n\nNEW YORK - Ivanka Trump testified repeatedly that she could not recall documents and emails related to the Trump Organization when the state attorney general's office confronted her about them during her father's civil fraud trial in a lower Manhattan courtroom on Wednesday.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's eldest daughter spent hours on the witness stand, where she denied knowledge of \"granular\" financial details contained in the documents while undergoing both direct questioning from Attorney General Letitia James's team and cross-examination from her father's defense counsel.\n\nBIDEN CAMPAIGN TAKES VICTORY LAP ON DEMOCRATIC WINS AFTER POOR POLLING\n\nHer consistently measured responses stood in contrast to Donald Trump's contentious testimony from Monday when Judge Arthur Engoron scolded the former president for giving political \"speeches\" instead of answering questions directly.\n\nIvanka Trump's appearance comes after James alleged in a sweeping complaint last year that Donald Trump, three of his adult children, and two business partners conspired to overstate his net worth by billions of dollars over several years to secure better interest rates on loans and other favorable financial terms.\n\nIvanka Trump, an executive vice president at the Trump Organization until 2017, successfully had her name dropped from the case in June after arguing her narrow role in managing two redevelopment projects, the Doral resort in Miami and the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., occurred outside the statute of limitations.\n\nA New York appeals court found in the June decision that the six-year statute of limitations ruled out any alleged wrongdoing in the case before February 2016. Engoron has decided that based on that ruling, James could use evidence from before that time if it involved future business activity that extended beyond 2016.\n\nThe attorney general still called Ivanka Trump to testify for the day as a witness to her father's business operation despite failing to pin her as a defendant.\n\nIn September, Engoron found Donald Trump, his sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., and two Trump Organization executives liable for business fraud, and the trial is now largely intended to assess their penalties. James seeks $250 million in damages and aims to ban Trump from conducting business in New York, where a concentration of the Trump Organization's premier properties are located.\n\nJames's attorney Louis Solomon showed evidence on Wednesday that Ivanka Trump in 2011 was part of email exchanges referencing discussions about loan interest rates. The loans, obtained through private lender Deutsche Bank, were contingent upon Donald Trump serving as a guarantor so long as he maintained a certain minimum net worth that excluded his brand value.\n\n\"I don't remember having these conversations other than very high level,\" Ivanka Trump said.\n\nSolomon became frustrated and even incredulous at times as the former president's daughter continuously said she could not recall specific information.\n\nIvanka Trump was, for instance, asked about whether Donald Trump discussed his financial statements and net worth at a meeting they both attended in 2011 regarding the Old Post Office, later known as the Trump International Hotel. She said she did not remember that but that she instead remembered how she presented a \"vision\" and how she used the \"iconic Plaza Hotel\" to illustrate her family's redevelopment abilities to the General Services Administration, which owned the asset.\n\n\"She just spent three minutes describing the Plaza Hotel, how it's similar to this!\" Solomon yelled. \"But she has no recollection when I ask her a question?\"\n\nJesus Suarez led the cross-examination, which marked the beginning of Trump's defense team's portion of the trial and the conclusion of James's. The trial began on Oct. 2, and Trump attorney Chris Kise estimated this week that his team would conclude their side of the case by Dec. 15.\n\nSuarez aggressively zeroed in on Deutsche Bank's desire to maintain the Trumps as a client.\n\nHe highlighted how Deutsche Bank would sometimes offer the Trumps new banking opportunities and how its executives sought to showcase the bank's relationship with the Trumps publicly, signaling how much the bank valued the Trumps as a client.\n\nSuarez displayed several emails underscoring his point. In one email, Deutsche Bank's Rosemary Vrablic wrote to Ivanka Trump asking her to participate in an apparent public relations video for the bank. In another, Vrablic expressed warm sentiments about how she found Ivanka Trump's accomplishments at Doral \"very impressive\" after personally visiting and touring the property.\n\nIvanka Trump became more candid and sentimental as she recalled how she focused on the physical aspects of her two Trump Organization acquisitions, indicating her memory was more vivid in that arena.\n\nFor Doral, Ivanka Trump said her father was responsible for the redevelopment of the golf course while she focused on the rest of the resort's renovations.\n\n\"My father has a particular affinity for golf and a particular vision for that,\" Ivanka Trump said with a smile, noting the former president \"loved\" the property and wanted to see it reach its full physical and operational potential.\n\nDeutsche Bank was \"quite excited\" by Donald Trump's vision for the Doral property, she said, adding that the bank sent teams of people down to tour it amid the Trump Organization's acquisition of it.\n\nWhile no witnesses are scheduled for Thursday, Donald Trump's defense team is expected to file motions this week, including a mistrial motion, before fully diving into their side of the case next week."

James is seeking $250 million from the former president for allegedly inflating his own net worth to garner more favorable loan terms.\n\nDonald Trump and his sons deny any wrongdoing in the case, with Donald Trump Jr. showing an unbothered approach during his court testimony and Eric Trump seeking to distance himself from his father's financial statements in the case."

      "text": "The Long Sordid Career Of Creepy Joe Biden\n\nAuthored by Donald Jeffries via substack,\n\nI get complaints from people that I concentrate too much on Donald Trump. Basically, the message is, \"But what about Biden?\" I do write more about Trump, because he's the face of the perceived opposition. The only Emmanuel Goldstein in town. I assume everyone reading me understands just who and what Joe Biden is.\n\nBut people might not remember quite everything about Joe Biden's lengthy career as a beloved resident of the Washington, D.C. swamp that Trump promised to drain. Biden was first elected as a U.S. Senator from Delaware in 1973. Even I was very young then. In 1981, the great \"liberal\" senator strongly supported the Intelligence Identities Protection Act, passed in the wake of CIA whistleblower Philip Agee's disclosures about the Agency is his best-selling book Inside the Company. Biden declared that \"I do not think anybody has any doubt about Mr. Agee. We should lock him away in my opinion.\" The good senator really liked locking people up, it seems. As a strong supporter of the 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act, he took credit for a draconian provision that mandated a five year sentence for possessing small amounts of crack cocaine.\n\nLittle did Biden know that, decades later his own troubled son Hunter would be caught with enough crack cocaine to garner a long prison sentence under the original 1986 Act, which was softened a bit in 2010. With every ounce of \"liberal\" ardor that he could muster, Biden bragged at the time, \"If you have a piece of crack cocaine no bigger than this quarter that I'm holding in my hand, one quarter of one dollar, we passed a law - with leadership of Sen. Thurmond and myself and others - a law that says: you're caught with that, you go to jail for five years. You get no probation, you get nothing, other than five years in jail. Judge doesn't have a choice.\" Senator Biden also authored the horrendous 1994 crime bill which featured \"three strike you're out\" and mandatory sentencing, significantly increasing the prison population.\n\nA JFK assassination researcher attended a Joe Biden seminar in 2005. He was able to briefly question Biden about the assassination. As recounted on a discussion forum, this was the short conversation: \"Senator Biden, do you believe JFK was killed as a result of a conspiracy?\" Answer:  \"No.\" \"So do you believe that Lee Harvey Oswald, alone and unaided, killed President Kennedy?\" Answer:  \"Yes.\" This is hardly surprising, of course, but reflects Biden's ironclad establishment mindset. In 2019, the American Prospect published a piece headlined, \"Joe Biden's Love Affair With the CIA.\" Biden was very helpful to Reagan's CIA Director William Casey, who praised him in a classified early 1980s memo to his intelligence staff. Biden would state, in a speech at Stanford, that the intelligence community had been compromised by leaks.\n\nSo Joe Biden was never one of the Democratic Party politicians I admired back in my misguided youth. He wasn't going to expose the abuses of the intelligence agencies, like a Frank Church. He wasn't interested in any \"sunshine\" laws that would make it easier for the People to be informed about their government. His concern then about \"leaks\" would evolve into concern over whistleblowers like Edward Snowden and Julian Assange. In a January, 2023 tweet, Snowden would comment on Biden's classified documents scandal, accusing the Department of Justice of suppressing the story until after the election, and declared, \"Worth noting that the President seems to have absconded with more classified documents than many whistleblowers.\" Biden is on the record as saying that Snowden should \"face the consequences of his actions.\"\n\nFollowing Julian Assange's release from exile last week, some assumed that the Biden administration had been responsible for it, given Biden's recent statements that he was \"considering\" dropping the charges against the Wikileaks founder. However, the White House would issue a statement maintaining that they had not played a role in Assange's plea deal. A deal which, incidentally, made the disappearance of all those troubling DNC emails a prerequisite for his release. So if you're tempted to think that perhaps, after over fifty years of serving the interests of the corrupt Deep State, Joe Biden finally did something good, you'd be wrong. Why spoil a perfect record? Even Barack Obama commuted Bradley/Chelsea Manning's sentence.\n\nSo we get to the Joe Biden we've come to know and love.\n\nApparently beset with relatively early dementia, he has bumbled, mumbled, and stumbled his way through an embarrassing series of verbal and physical gaffes. He has also avoided being held accountable for some pretty blatant criminality. As far back as when Hunter and his late brother Beau were little boys, Daddy Joe had a disturbing habit of \"crashing\" into vacant mansions that were on the market. They literally sometimes entered through unlocked windows. As a long time realtor, I can tell you that it's pretty simple to make a call and schedule an appointment to see a property, especially a vacant one. It is unknown why the then United States Senator engaged in such bizarre behavior, but it speaks to some kind of odd personality flaw.\n\nHunter wasn't the only Biden offspring to become addicted to the drugs the young senator wanted to crack down on (pun intended). Biden's daughter Ashley wrote openly about the \"inappropriate\" showers her father took with her when she was a young girl in her journal. This triggered an unfortunate promiscuity in her, as well as an addiction to illegal drugs. We only know about this journal, because Ashley left it behind at a drug rehab center, and the woman who found it sold it to Truth Veritas. Being as we are living in America 2.0, and not some vaunted \"democracy,\" the woman was prosecuted and served thirty days in jail. Joe Biden remains unscathed by what should be a very serious scandal. It's not like he bounced his daughter on his knee, like Donald Trump and every other father has.\n\nLeft free to his own devices, Creepy Joe resumed his long history of inappropriately touching little girls, much of it documented on videotape. Our beloved president has a rarely known perverse kink for sniffing their hair. Again, this is all clearly shown on film. If only the Washington Generals were an actual opposition party, they might want to use those damning film clips in their campaign ads. I don't know what kind of evidence existed against any pedophiles who were given long prison sentences, but how much more incriminating can you get than an adult grabbing the undeveloped chests of minor girls, while their facial expressions register their discomfort? Sure, there is supposedly the filmed rape of a ten year old girl by Hunter Biden on his laptop, but that's been sent down the memory hole along with those DNC emails.\n\nMen have been prosecuted and given lengthy prison sentences for less clear evidence of child abuse than what can be seen freely online, in numerous past instances, from our current president. Either this is the heinous crime most of us think it is, or it's no big deal. So release all the pedophiles. Unless you have video of them actually raping children. Like the alleged rape of a child on Hunter Biden's laptop. Or the still never seen videos of our glorious troops raping Iraqi boys while their mothers scream. Seymour Hersh claims to have seen them. Some pedophiles are more equal than others. Just keep repeating, \"grab 'em by the pussy\" and click your heels three times. Creepy Joe's rather sensual kissing of his own granddaughter was also notable. Maybe he forgot it was his granddaughter. Or he was hoping to shower with her.\n\nBiden was caught, again, on videotape , boasting about getting a Ukrainian prosecutor fired. Who was looking into his son's (and his) financial improprieties in that wonderful democracy presided over by a former actor, who has a legendary proficiency for penis piano playing. That's pretty damning evidence. But no, it was Donald Trump instead, who was impeached because of a \"perfect\" telephone conversation to the very same crisis actor/comedian Volodymyr Zelenskyy. For asking the astute pianist to look into any possible corruption by the Bidens. I think there's an obvious message there. But that's what happens when you play for the Washington Generals. It's a Harlem Globetrotters thing, you wouldn't understand.\n\nI have written many articles over the years for the American Free Press, detailing Hunter Biden's financial shenanigans in Ukraine. They are intermingled with the \"Big Guy,\" the same timeless statesman who has sniffed more girlish hair than any other political leader in the history of the formerly free world. Hunter Biden's emails reveal that the \"Big Guy\"- his loving father- always got a cut of the booty, no matter what. Just like court historian hero William Sherman, who always got a cut of all the personal property his Union troops stole from southern civilians. As my new book American Memory Hole will show, this theft is a grand American tradition going back at least to the Mexican-American War. The Bidens obviously know their history.\n\nJoe Biden, when he has been comprehensible, has said some remarkable things during his terrifying presidency. How many times has he claimed that \"White Supremacy\" represents \"the greatest danger to democracy?\" Now, keep in mind this is the corrupt elite's definition of democracy, not any form of government the ancient Greeks would recognize. That speech he made, with the bright red backdrop and sinister lighting, was perhaps the worst speech any U.S. president has ever made, when factoring in the background. All that was missing was the hammer and sickle, or a Lenin-style goatee on Creepy Joe's chin. The Stupid Party objected a bit to that speech, in their weak, customary manner, but it should have offended every American. If only the sane remaining among us were allowed to be offended in America 2.0.\n\nOn occasion, Creepy Joe's attention is distracted from the hair and undeveloped chests of little girls, onto adult women. Dr. Jill was an adult (I think) after all, when she started babysitting the Biden children. Maybe he loved her shampoo. But then there was Tara Reade. Reade accused then Senator Biden of doing something remarkably similar to what E. Jean Carroll would accuse Donald Trump of. Only Tara could recall the year it happened, unlike Carroll. And she has never been videotaped writhing around on the floor like a lunatic, unlike Carroll. I seriously doubt she has a dog named Tits or paints her trees blue, like Carroll does. Reade was ridiculed by the same state controlled press and feminists who believed Carroll. A ridiculous jury awarded Carroll millions of dollars. Reade fled to Russia for her own safety.\n\nHollywood and the kept media make fun of Trump's sons. There are inferences about Eric being \"special.\" Riding the short bus. Those distasteful remarks are just fine, as long as they're made against the \"right\" people. They are free to joke all they want about young Barron Trump, for instance, regarding whether he's on the autistic spectrum. You know, the spectrum that didn't exist until about thirty years ago. You'll lose your medical license if you suggest there's a connection there to all the massive increases in vaccines doled out to our children. But no comedian jokes about Ashley Biden's numerous brushes with the law. Or the unmentioned Biden, Creepy Joe's brother Frank, who has a crime record the sainted George Floyd would have envied. The \"Big Guy\" has a niece, Caroline, who also has had several run-ins with the law.\n\nHave you heard anyone, including Fox News, Breitbart, or other conservative outlets, talk about the Biden crime family? Remember poor Billy Carter? He was ridiculed and considered a real embarrassment to the still living former peanut farmer. He never wracked up all the DUIs that Frank Biden has. But Billy Beer was pretty putrid, for those of you old enough to remember it. Even young Amy Carter and young Chelsea Clinton had their looks cruelly mocked by comedians. No comedian is about to mock Hunter Biden, famously photographed asleep with a crack pipe in his mouth, let alone Ashley Biden. Can you imagine what the hysterical shrews on The View would say if Ivanka Trump had written about inappropriate showers with her father?\n\nNow, all Biden's greatest crimes appear to have been committed before he developed dementia, Alzheimer's, or whatever it is that he has. I doubt if Hunter or anyone else is even giving him his ten percent cut nowadays. Over the course of his presidency, Biden has been caught on film uttering inanities that often sound alien in nature. Maybe it's the Reptile in him coming out. How many times have we seen him wandering off, like a misguided toddler. He did this recently at an international gathering, and despite the fact that the president of Italy was captured on film grabbing him by the arm, and leading him back to safety, Biden's ridiculous DEI press secretary insisted that the video had been altered. His doddering was termed a \"cheap fake,\" or \"deep fake,\" depending on the source. Who can argue with that?\n\nJoe Biden, in fact, has been so absurd in his role as president that many suggest he is a cheap or deep fake. Some say the real Biden died a while back, and has been replaced by a clone or robot. Boy, you'd think they could make a more realistic and competent clone or robot than that. It makes one cringe to watch him try to express himself. He reminds me very much of the Peter Sellers character in the film Being There. Although Biden is not known to have been mentally challenged during his life, and nothing he's said as president could ever be mistaken for profundity, as was the case with the Sellers' character. He is also prone to making his key points in a menacing whisper. No, his stutter isn't a lifelong thing, as his old filmed speeches demonstrate. It is unknown at what age he began inappropriately touching little girls.\n\nBiden has issued more racist comments than Donald Trump could ever dream up. He has stated that those Blacks who don't vote for him are not really Black. He called inner city schools \"jungles.\" He compared poor students to White students. Senator Joe Biden helped put untold numbers of nonviolent Black crack cocaine addicts in prison. He simply makes up stories about his past, depending on his audience. He obviously didn't go to a historically Black college, as he told a Black audience. He wasn't practically raised in a synagogue, as he bragged to a Jewish audience. At least the \"Corn Pop was a bad dude\" story was funny. Fictional, but funny. Funnier than the millions of illegals he has opened the border to, flown around the country, and deposited in five star hotels. While our own homeless citizens crap in the streets.\n\nJoe Biden's \"performance\" in the presidential debate the other night exposed the serious problems he has with his faculties at this point. He was filmed after the debate, struggling, with the help of someone on each side, to navigate one step down off the stage. Dr. Jill, who is essentially his handler, was recorded congratulating him for \"answering all the questions,\" in the manner a mother would praise a preschooler for using the potty by himself. It is unclear if Joe Biden is potty trained now. Rumors persist that he has publicly pooped his pants, with the latest incident being at a Normandy commemoration ceremony. Those with TDS insist that Trump has done this as well, and wears adult diapers. Maybe neither of them is potty trained. No one can say that the American people aren't offered the best and the brightest choices.\n\nExactly what record would Joe Biden run on? The billions given to Ukraine? Anyone who buys gas or shops at a grocery store knows that inflation is now worse than it has ever been in our lives. And yet Creepy Joe just cites phony statistics to claim otherwise. His administration is peopled with politically correct, sideshow circus freaks. While there is no known sword swallower, there was the bald, red dressed high ranking official who kept stealing women's luggage at airports. And then there is our health czar Rachel Levine, who I suppose somehow \"identifies\" as a healthy person. The other day, the Queer Eye for the Straight Guy gender fluids visited the White House. Vice presidential cackler Kamala Harris actually answered the door. You know George Washington and Thomas Jefferson would be proud.\n\nI don't know what they're planning to do with Biden.\n\nThe day after the debate, he sounded suspiciously more lucid. He's done that before. Dementia doesn't usually work that way. Maybe presidential dementia is different.\n\nPerhaps we'll get Gruesome Newsom. Or Hillary could stage a Brett Favre-like comeback. The sensational rumors about Michelle Obama actually being Big Mike, would cover all the DEI bases. It would represent a national \"Woke\" orgasm. They could have the \"big reveal\" in the Rose Garden. Or they could just opt to install Biden again. It's not like he could be much less capable of the job than he's been since his initial selection. He'll have all the fawning press coverage he needs. His absurd persona will be off-limits to the late night comedians.

      "text": "Ivanka Is the Business-Savvy Feminist We Need in the White House\n\nD uring a panel with other female global leaders in Germany last week, Ivanka Trump responded with poise as she discussed the controversy surrounding her defense of her father regarding his comments on women. \"I grew up in a house where there was no barrier to what I could accomplish beyond my own perseverance and tenacity,\" she said. \"That's not an easy thing to do; he provided that for us.\"\n\nU.S. media reports unfairly focused on how the European audience booed Ivanka Trump, but the video of the incident reveals a lot more. Yes, there were a few isolated boos and hisses, but they followed extraordinarily harsh and nasty questions from the moderator Miriam Meckel, editor-in-chief of the weekly business news magazine WirtschaftsWoche . Even Democratic Party defender Hilary Rosen commented on her Facebook page that the opening question to Ivanka was unfair.\n\nWhy does the anti-Trump media delight so much in attacking the president's oldest daughter? Some have argued she is hypocritical in ignoring her father's inappropriate words and actions toward women. But this assumption seems shallow. How do we know Ivanka didn't feel hurt by Trump's comments or attempt to handle her pain privately? At the end of the day, she is his daughter, and her focus on empowering women is the most powerful antidote to aspersions on the family name.\n\nHer father's position may have helped her career, but Ivanka has proven herself effective in both business and politics. She made her mark on Celebrity Apprentice . She built her own successful enterprise. She spoke effectively and passionately on women's issues at the Republican National Convention. She serves in the White House as an unpaid presidential adviser and is highly influential with the president. And she is doing her job in a fishbowl while raising three young children in a new city.\n\nMost importantly, she is focused on a significant global problem: the challenges women face to raise the money they need to start businesses. Even in Silicon Valley, women often deal with discrimination from the overwhelmingly male group of investors and decision-makers. As humans, we naturally trust and invest in the people we think are most like us, which means that men mostly invest in men.\n\nIn his book The Big Idea , Donald Trump advocates for major transformational business concepts. While her father is trying to apply the \"big idea\" concept to policy, Ivanka is working with leaders around the world to create a fund to invest in woman-owned businesses. This is Ivanka's own big idea - female entrepreneurship may be highly effective in growing economies and moving families out of poverty.\n\nIvanka's convention speech was stirring. Almost all of it could have been given at the Democratic National Convention and would have received a standing ovation. An issue rests with her justifiable desire for pay equity for women - she doesn't appear to realize that the law already requires equal pay for equal jobs. The resistance to the proposal for equal pay for \"comparable\" jobs comes from businesses concerned about the vast litigation that would result in courts deciding which jobs are \"comparable.\" In any case, Ivanka's sincere, passionate and effective approach in her arguments and actions focusing on greater pay and empowerment for women is resonating.\n\nOthers argue her success is only the result of her father's wealth. This may be partly true, but her obvious intelligence, empathy, confidence and judgment are not because of her wealth. Ivanka and her siblings are businessmen and women, but they are also fathers and mothers, husbands and wives. Indeed, many of the Trump voters I have spoken with say they voted for him in part because his children seem so well-adjusted.\n\nIvanka is in a position of power, and as a feminist, she is using that position to fight for women. Attacks by those who think that anything connected to President Trump is entirely evil or unfair run counter - and ultimately are harmful - to the very cause of equality the attackers claim to support.\n\nDiminishing Ivanka undercuts opportunity for all women. This does not mean she should be immune from criticism, the criticism should be fair, factual, and focused on her own work - not the coincidence of her birth.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

Hudson's Bay adds to the laundry list of companies dropping Ivanka's products including Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, and T.J. Maxx.\n\nHudson's Bay cites \"weak performance\" as their rationale for the move. The drop in sales is spurred by the wave of boycotts against Trump products, as emphasized by some less-than-friendly tweets:\n\nBREAKING: Ivanka Trump is shutting down her fashion brand. Americans don't like traitors who import cheap clothes that look terrible. Go figure.\n\n- Scott Dworkin (@funder) July 24, 2018\n\nBREAKING: Ivanka Trump is closing down her fashion line.\n\nI'm sure she will claim it's because she wants to concentrate on her work for the country.\n\nThe actual reason... IT'S FAILING!!\n\nWOMP WOMP @IvankaTrump\n\n- Brian Krassenstein (@krassenstein) July 24, 2018\n\nMany criticized Ivanka and her father for the President's supposed \"exemption\" of Ivanka's clothing line from the billions of dollars of tariffs against China. Upon further inspection, it was discovered that no clothing line, not even one , had been included in the tariff list, making this claim difficult to prove at best.\n\nThis leads to a chicken-egg scenario. Were sales slowing because the products were truly lackluster or because of the mounting pressure from the Left to boycott Ivanka products? Ivanka herself mentioned neither in her decision to step back from the brand, instead stating that she is simply too busy to oversee the business.\n\nA spokesperson said , \"The decision has nothing to do with the performance of the brand and is based solely on Ivanka's decision to remain in Washington indefinitely\".\n\nAs President Trump's close confidant and advisor on all things business and political, Ivanka is busy in Washington . Politics isn't enriching the Trump family, as some have suggested, but cost Ivanka, at least, dearly.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "Open Letter to Ivanka Trump: Serve Your Father by Relying on Scientists, Not Celebrities Who Push Climate Calamity\n\nN OTE: The following is a letter Heartland Institute President Joseph Bast sent to Ivanka Trump, top advisor to president Donald Trump. As of today, he has received no response.\n\nDear Ms. Trump,\n\nRecent news stories report your interest in the climate change issue. I share your deep concern over the future of our planet - it's an unbelievably beautiful and precious thing, something we must cherish and protect for all of Earth's creatures and for future generations.\n\nI am writing to urge you to proceed carefully as you explore this subject, because those who claim climate change requires \"immediate action\" to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, or even \"transforming the world's economic system,\" have often misrepresented the science and economics of this issue.\n\nMy organization, The Heartland Institute , is a national nonprofit organization that has been making the case for conservative and libertarian ideas since its founding in 1984. Many members of the Trump transition team are familiar with our work on climate change and other topics.\n\nThe Heartland Institute is \"the world's most prominent think tank supporting skepticism of man-made climate change\" (according to The Economist ) . We have published more books, policy studies, and commentaries on the topic than any other free-market think tank in the world (according to the scientific journal Global Environmental Change ). We are one of the top ten free-market think tanks in the world (according to TheBestSchools.org).\n\nThe truth is that climate change does not require that we reduce energy consumption or replace fossil fuels with alternative energies.\n\nYour father is right when he questions whether global warming is a genuine \"crisis\" or a product of hype and exaggeration by various interest groups. He is also right to suggest that the issue is being used to extort money from the United States, handicap American businesses, and undermine our economic growth and prosperity.\n\nClaims That Global Warming Is Already Happening\n\nThe popular \"evidence\" that man-made global warming is already happening and is harmful consists mostly of images of melting ice, heat waves, hurricanes, and rising tides. These images appeared in Al Gore's movie, An Inconvenient Truth, and more recently in Leonardo DiCaprio's movie Before the Flood.\n\nPoliticians and celebrities sometimes travel to the Arctic and come back saying they have \"seen global warming,\" that \"it is real and already happening.\" But these images and claims are highly misleading. You can't see man-made climate change. Climate is \"average weather\" over the course of at least 30 years. Extreme weather is always occurring sometime around the world, and always has and always will.\n\nObserving extreme weather events can't tell us whether the climate is changing, or what might be causing changes in weather or climate. For that, we need to view long-term trends, and even then we need to control for known climate cycles and natural variability.\n\nSimply put, there simply is no hard scientific evidence that potentially harmful warming is happening. Dr. Benjamin Zycher, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote in 2014 a short and accurate summary of research on long-term trends in extreme weather:\n\nThere has been no temperature trend over the last 15 years , notwithstanding the predictions of the models.\n\nThe past two years have set a record for the fewest tornadoes ever in a similar period, and there has been no trend in the frequency of strong (F3 to F5) tornadoes in the United States since 1950.\n\nThe number of wildfires is in a long-term decline.\n\nIt has been eight years since a Category 3 or higher hurricane landed on a U.S. coast; that long a period devoid of an intense hurricane landfall has not been observed since 1900. The 2013 Atlantic hurricane season was the least active in 40 years, with zero major hurricanes.\n\nThere has been no trend in the frequency or intensity of tropical cyclones, and tropical cyclone energy is near its lowest level since reliable measurements began by satellite in the 1970s.\n\nThere is no long-term trend in sea-level increases. The record of changes in the size of the Arctic ice cover is far more ambiguous than often asserted, because the satellite measurements began at the outset of the warming period from roughly 1980 through 1998.\n\nThe Palmer Drought Severity Index shows no trend since 1895. Flooding in the United States over the last century has not been correlatedwith increases in greenhouse gas concentrations.\n\nZycher's summary is supported by the sources he cites as well as four hefty volumes in the Climate Change Reconsidered series produced by the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC) and published by The Heartland Institute. The NIPCC series is credible: It has been cited in more than 100 peer-reviewed articles. The Chinese Academy of Sciences thought so highly of it that it translated the first two volumes into Mandarin Chinese and published a condensed edition in 2013.\n\nSo no, there simply is no hard evidence that man-made climate change is already occurring or that it is bad. You should immediately suspect the credibility (or sincerity) of anyone who claims otherwise. They are using scare tactics to get you to think a certain way.\n\nAppeals to Authority\n\nThose who say global warming is a crisis ask you to believe the opinions of \"experts\" who, upon closer inspection, are unqualified, speaking outside their areas of expertise, or biased. For example, Al Gore, Leonardo DiCaprio, Bill McKibben, Bill Gates, and Naomi Orestes are not scientists. Senator Gore was flunking undergraduate physics at Harvard when he dropped out of that class.\n\nPresident Obama's claim in 2014 that \"97% of scientists agree: climate change is real, man-made and dangerous\" is not supported by any credible survey or science literature review. NASA, on its website, cites four sources for this claim: two are essays written by college students, one literature review by a socialist historian, and the fourth one a literature review by an Australian blogger.\n\nSee Why Scientists Disagree about Global Warming for a full critique of each of these sources, and a summary of more reliable surveys and literature reviews that find extensive disagreement. A copy of that book is enclosed.\n\nAlarmists often cite the reports of the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IIPCC), but this is a political, not a scientific, organization. It conducts no original climate research. Its reports are not subject to traditional peer review, and they have become compilations of anecdotal evidence in support of a pre-ordained conclusion. That is not science. See the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change's testimony to the British Parliament critiquing the latest IPCC report.\n\nFinally, those who say global warming is a crisis often claim that those who disagree with them are either \"paid shills of the oil industry\" or part of a \"vast right-wing conspiracy\" that puts economic growth and profits ahead of protecting the environment. Both claims are false.\n\nAl Gore created the myth that global warming skeptics are paid by industry to \"sow doubt,\" although he falsely claims it was discovered by a former reporter named Ross Gelbspan. There is no evidence of any \"skeptic\" ever being paid to lie about climate science or its impacts. See Russell Cook's excellent report on this myth titled Merchants of Smear .\n\nOnce you look at the underlying science - the same sort of number crunching you would perform for a complicated business transaction - you will discover there is no scientific case for reducing our use of fossil fuels.\n\nThe Science, by the Numbers\n\nHere are the key numbers you need to know to understand the climate change issue:\n\n0.04% The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, that's about 400 parts per million. In the past century it has only gone up by 0.01 percentage point. Carbon dioxide concentrations have risen and fallen before, in pre-industrial eras, without causing climate to change.\n\n1.0 - 1.5C Climate sensitivity, the change in global temperature likely to result from a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from pre-industrial levels. We are already half-way to such a doubling, so the warming in the coming century even assuming the alarmists in the debate are right and are not exaggerating, is likely to be too small be to noticeable against natural climate cycles and variability.\n\n1 - 2 mm The long-term annual rise in sea level, since the end of the last Ice Age, which has not increased in the 21 st century. This is too small to merit efforts to slow or stop global warming. Claims that sea level is rising faster are based on cherry-picked data sets and fail to take into account land subsidence in some coastal areas.\n\n0.06C The reduction in global temperature that would be achieved by the year 2100 if the U.S. reduced its emissions by 40%, just six one-hundredths of one degree. This is too little to warrant the enormous cost - trillions of dollars - of replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy.\n\n$3,900 The annual per-family cost of Obama's global warming policies, according to a study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n$27 billon How much federal agencies plan to spend on global warming-related programs in 2017.\n\nWhat Should We Do?\n\nWe should all do our share to protect the environment. But the campaign to reduce energy use or to switch from fossil fuels to solar and wind power is not about protecting the environment. It's about something else.\n\nSince climate is always changing due to natural causes, we should invest in resiliency (hardening infrastructure) and adaptation. Trying to stop global warming from occurring is not necessary, nor is it the best way to protect the environment.\n\nClimate change is a small and remote threat, at best. We probably cannot slow or stop it even if we try. And the cost of ending our primary reliance on fossil fuels is astronomical.\n\nMy organization, The Heartland Institute, recommends your father's administration take the following steps regarding climate change:\n\nPlease don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. While not a scientist myself, I have had the privilege of working with the Nongovernmental  International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC), an international team of independent climate scientists whose research supports the various statements made above, and who are willing to pitch in and help your father set a new course for climate policy in the years ahead.\n\nThank you for your concern and for your openness to differing opinions on this important issue.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJoseph L.

      "text": "The Left's Anti-Trump Boycott Appears To Be Backfiring On The Left\n\nA s the Left continues its extreme hatred for everything related to President Donald Trump, some of the Left's tactics may actually be helping to increase the billionaire's family business.\n\nTake, for example, the Left's boycott of first-daughter Ivanka Trump's products.\n\nAccording to Fortune.com , Ivanka Trump's perfumes \"have taken over the top two best-selling spots on Amazon.com's beauty section.\"\n\nAs of early Saturday, Ivanka Trump Eu de Parfum Spray for Women and Ivanka Trump for Women Roller Ball are the No. 1 and No.2 best sellers, respectively, on Amazon. They retail between $15 to $46.50 on the website. For the most part, boycotts today are more about making political statements than causing actual economic harm to the boycott's targets.\n\nAlthough the goal of a boycott is to \"stop buying or using the goods or services of a certain company or country as a protest,\" with rare exceptions , most economic boycotts today are just not that successful.\n\nIn some cases, economic boycotts can actually have the reverse effect and actually cause the targeted business to actually flourish, as a result.\n\nOne may recall when the gay community called for a Chick-fil-A boycott in 2012 due to the company's CEO stating he opposed gay marriage.\n\nInstead of hurting Chick-fil-A, sales actually increased a whopping 12% that year.\n\nFollowing the Left's call to boycott LL Bean (and Trump's tweet supporting the company), there has been an \"uptick\" in business, according to Nathan Clark, the vice chairman of the L.L. Bean board.\n\nIn the case of the Left's anything-related-to-Trump anti-Trump boycotts, not only is Ivanka Trump's perfume sales surging, so too is Trump's wine, according to the Richmond Times Dispatch.\n\nA boycott of Trump Winery products at Wegmans has caused just the opposite effect: Five of the wine varieties have sold out at the two Richmond-area Wegmans stores.\n\n\"Both Midlothian and Short Pump (stores) have sold out all five of the Trump wines we carry,\" said Jo Natale, vice president of media relations for Wegmans. \"They will be replenished when they are available, possibly three to four weeks.\"\n\nThe grocery retailer's eight other stores in Virginia also either have sold out of all or have sold out of some Trump Winery varieties, she said.\n\nThere is little doubt that the Left will continue trying to hurt the President and his family's business for the next for years (and beyond).\n\nHowever, ironically, through its efforts to do so, the Left may actually be helping the billionaire's businesses.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "Standing Tall on the Platform\n\nT he Talmud ( Yoma 22b-23a) poses a challenge to the man of virtue, fighting for noble causes, who is belittled by obstructionist forces. On the one hand, if he does not avenge the honor of his mission \"like a snake,\" he will be trodden underfoot, unworthy of serious consideration as a visionary. On the other hand, the Bible does not permit acts specifically motivated by personal revenge. How to solve this dilemma?\n\nTwo conditions are imposed. One, he should let his surrogates prosecute the grievance, rather than doing it himself. Two, the method employed should not be vicious or hurtful.\n\nIt becomes clear upon closer examination that the most valid form of avenging the honor of the cause is by promoting that very honor in a way that shows up the pettiness of that sullying skeptic.\n\nIndeed the Hasidic tradition sees the roots of this notion in the phrase (Psalms 94:1): \"God of Vengeance, appear!\" The founder of Hasidism, Israel Baal-Shemtov, explained that God's ideal form of vengeance for His honor is not through punishment but through revelation, by \"appearing,\" demonstrating His honor until the one who doubted Him is ashamed.\n\nThis week we witnessed this approach artfully practiced by Donald J. Trump against AIPAC (American Israel Political Action Committee), the powerful lobby ostensibly dedicated to supporting the State of Israel. When Trump spoke at AIPAC's annual gathering in Washington, D.C. earlier this year, his message backing Israel and condemning Palestinian incitement roused the crowd of sixteen thousand to their feet. He concluded by proudly announcing that his third \"beautiful\" Jewish grandchild was expected any day.\n\n(Both Presidential candidates have daughters who married Jews. Ivanka Trump converted to Judaism and is a practicing Orthodox Jew who keeps a kosher home and observes the Sabbath and holidays. Chelsea Clinton, by contrast, was married in a multidenominational ceremony amid a muddled mishmash of symbols that managed to simultaneously cheapen both Judaism and Christianity.)\n\nSo what's not to like?\n\nNope, the AIPAC machers were miffed. Trump had included a throwaway line to the effect that it was a relief for Israel that Obama would soon be out of office - \"Yay!\" - eliciting lusty applause from the crowd. Intolerable! So the very next day AIPAC repudiated its own guest and disavowed Trump's remarks. The organization apologized to Obama for providing a platform for such effrontery. Fortunately Trump came by plane so their attempt to throw him under the bus failed. But much as we try to ignore stupidity, it still smarts.\n\nFast forward to this week in Cleveland, where Republicans have hied to crown Donald Trump. The main activities for delegates are to spot LeBron James and to avoid John Kasich. While awaiting the main event next week, they are hammering together the planks of the party's platform. The last two elections the platforms were fitted with trap doors to turn them into gallows, but this time there is an effort afoot to review some of those stands and see if we can build a reviewing stand instead.\n\nMister Trump took an especial interest in the plank about Israel. He sent his two closest advisers on Israel, attorneys Jason Greenblatt and David Friedman. They were determined to avoid the weasely language AIPAC had foisted on the hapless 2012 team, calling for a \"two-state solution.\" After all, the first Republican to accept the two-state solution was George W. Bush on June 24, 2002, and he had predicated his stance on several preconditions which he outlined in a letter .\n\nPalestinians must undertake an immediate cessation of armed activity and all acts of violence against Israelis anywhere, and all official Palestinian institutions must end incitement against Israel. The Palestinian leadership must act decisively against terror, including sustained, targeted, and effective operations to stop terrorism and dismantle terrorist capabilities and infrastructure. Palestinians must undertake a comprehensive and fundamental political reform that includes a strong parliamentary democracy...\n\nFourteen years later we have none of the above.\n\nSo Trump's people teamed up with the great Republican lovers of Israel, and instituted language crafted in consultation with Iron Dome Coalition, headed by Jeffrey Ballabon, a contributor to The American Spectator . Gone is any mention of a two-state solution. The BDS movement is identified as anti-Semitic. Support for Israel is deemed an expression of Americanism. As Ballabon points out, this was a large dose of truth, so naturally politicians will not enjoy swallowing it down. But this is what distinguishes the Trump candidacy. Politics is becoming more reality, less show.\n\nAIPAC prefers to maintain the fiction that Democrats are as supportive of Israel as Republicans. This creates a perverse incentive to hold back the Republicans less they show a greater enthusiasm than Democrats. But we all know that the left wing around the world has feted the Palestinians while roasting the Israelis, and American Democrats will never stray too far from the leftist herd. It is time to force Democrats to meet a higher bar rather than engage in the unseemly exercise of Jews trying to cool the Republican ardor for Israel.\n\nAnd so Trump has his revenge, in exactly the appropriate manner. No blustery putdowns, no petulant pejoratives. He took revenge on AIPAC by showing Israel that it will be safer relying on the grandfather of Theodore James Kushner.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

(Photo by KARIM SAHIB / AFP) (Photo by KARIM SAHIB/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nBut in a visit to a mosque, a holy site, diplomatic protocol typically requires adherence to custom and decorum - as is the case for the holy sites of other faiths, such as the Western Wall in Jerusalem, where men of all faiths are expected to wear kip pot or yarmulkes in accordance with Jewish tradition. At the Vatican, both Melania and Ivanka Trump covered their heads when meeting with Pope Francis.\n\nIn the Jewish faith, which Ivanka Trump shares, many married religious women also cover their heads out of modesty, especially in religious settings, though there is no Jewish equivalent of the Islamic veil.\n\nIn that context, Ivanka Trump's visit to the mosque was also significant, as she is among the first Jewish people to be an honored guest of a kingdom that has been, until recently, cold toward Israel and Jews.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates has, until recently, barred Israelis from entering the country, in a policy that has been described as antisemitic. However, relations are warming and those restrictions are being eased.\n\nIvanka Trump praised the United Arab Emirates for recent reforms that granted more freedom to women in the country, the AP reported .\n\nJoel B.

      "text": "Seven Times Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump Have Stood in the Way of the Trump MAGA Agenda\n\nArguably one of President Trump's most destructive moves in the wake of his historic victory a year ago was to install his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner as key advisors in the West Wing.\n\nThe apparently different worldview has clashed with that of Trump's base on a number of occasions, as well as a number of stumbles by the pair who are reportedly known within the West Wing as \"the royal family.\"\n\nWith Kushner's influence reportedly waning , these seven will make you thankful \"Javanka\" are falling, not rising in influence in the Trump White House.\n\nHere are some of their worst moments:\n\nJared Urges Trump to Fire FBI Director James Comey\n\nKushner, who carries the title of \"senior adviser,\" was reportedly one of the key voices in pushing for Trump to fire FBI Director James Comey in May. While Comey was no friend of the Trump administration and was known for his showboating and love of the spotlight, Comey's firing led to the appointment of former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel for the investigation into alleged Russian interference.\n\nBreitbart News Executive Chairman and former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon called it the biggest mistake in modern political history.\n\nMueller, in turn, has taken a broad interpretation of his mandate for the investigation, and negative headlines have dogged the administration for months. Last month three former Trump aides were indicted , including former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\n\nIvanka and Jared \"Blindsided\" by Trump's Transgender Ban\n\nSocial conservatives cheered when President Trump announced in July that he was banning transgender-identifying individuals from serving in the military. But Kushner and Ivanka, two socially-liberal Manhattanites were reportedly \"blindsided\" by the move, according to Politico.\n\nThe outlet reported that Ms. Trump was \"surprised\" and first learned of the news when she read it on her cell phone. It was not clear how the inner thoughts of Ms. Trump found their way onto the website of the left-wing outlet.\n\nIvanka Fails to Shift Trump on Paris\n\nThe liberal first daughter was believed to be a staunch supporter of the Obama-era Paris climate change agreement and fought to keep the U.S. in the job-killing deal. According to Politico, Ivanka brought Democrat climate-change peddler Al Gore into Trump Tower to talk it out with her dad and met with former Hollywood heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio to get his opinion on the topic.\n\nDespite telling friends that she was choosing that issue to push her father on, she failed and Trump announced his intention to ditch the deal. Neither Ivanka nor Jared were present at the announcement.\n\n'Sources' Gripe to New York Times About Trump's Stance on Virginia\n\nAfter violent protests in August by white nationalists and neo-Nazis, as well as counter-protests from so-called \"anti-fascists\", in Charlottesville, Virginia, Trump condemned both sides of the protests.\n\nApparently, Trump's stance upset not only the left-wing media but Jared and Ivanka. It didn't take long before the New York Times' Glenn Thrush cited \"sources\" that said Jared and Ivanka had called on Trump \"to more forcefully denounce\" the white nationalists. Seen as the latest in a long line of media leaks that cited either anonymous sources of \"sources close to Jared and Ivanka,\" it was quickly mocked as a clumsy leak by the \"royal family\" to distance themselves from the president.\n\nJared Gets Upset When Trump 'Undermines' Him in Mexico\n\nWhen Trump canceled a meeting with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto in January over Nieto's refusal to pay for the border wall, it somehow leaked to the media that Kushner was \"furious\" that his efforts were being \"undermined.\"\n\n\"Kushner was fucking furious,\" an anonymous source told Vanity Fair . \"I'd never once heard him say he was angry throughout the entire campaign. But he was furious.\"\n\nJared Encourages Trump to back Luther Strange in Alabama\n\nWhen the establishment-backed Sen. Luther Strange (R-AL) went up against the outsider, \"America First\" Judge Roy Moore, one may have expected Trump to back Moore. Instead, he backed the doomed candidate backed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).\n\nBut according to Politico, it was Kushner who made the push to persuade Trump to back him. \"Trump was encouraged to pick Strange before the August primary by son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner as well as other aides,\" the outlet reported.\n\nTrump had seemed to recognize he had made a bad decision even before a ballot was cast, telling a crowd in Huntsville: \"I might have made a mistake\" in endorsing Strange. He also promised to campaign for Moore if he won.\n\nJared and Ivanka Work to Kill LGBT Rights Order\n\nIn February, Politico (an outlet who regularly snags the inner machinations of the Kushner/Ivanka machine) reported that the pair helped kill off an order that would have overturned a 2014 Obama-era executive order preventing LGBT discrimination in the workplace.\n\nOnce again, \"sources close to Kushner and Ivanka Trump\" were cited for the information indicating their preference for a \"clear statement\" upholding the Obama-era order.\n\nAdam Shaw is a Breitbart News politics reporter based in New York.

(Mr. Tucker is also the stepson of Joe Lieberman, the first Jewish candidate to run on a major party ticket in the U.S.) \"I don't think people generally honor people they feel were accomplices to politics and policies they abhor,\" Mr. Tucker said.\n\nThe article also appears to blame the growth of the Lubavitch Chabad movement for the divisions in the Jewish community: \"The growth of Chabad correlates with fierce divisions about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and a small but growing contingent of American Jews who prioritize Israel above any other political or social issue.\"\n\nIt is not clear why the authors associate Chabad with divisions over Israel, as the movement has been growing rapidly for several decades, long before the advent of J Street and other left-wing Jewish organizations that oppose the Israeli government.\n\nIronically, the leader of chabad.org , the late Lubavitcher Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson , emphasized accepting all Jews, regardless of their political beliefs or their level of religious observance.\n\nThe article cites Kushner's role in U.S. policy toward Israel, including the opening of the U.S. embassy in Israel, something every president since Bill Clinton had promised but failed to deliver - until President Donald Trump.\n\n\"That embrace [of Israel] has only exacerbated tensions with secular Jews who overwhelmingly vote Democratic and oppose Mr. Trump,\" the authors write, inadvertently revealing the primary source of division in the community.\n\nThe article also cites left-wing Jews who allege that the president's daughter - who converted Orthodox - and her Jewish son-in-law are a mere \"fig leaf\" for the antisemites who support the administration.\n\nJoel B.

We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.\n\nNow that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate  media and \n\t\t\t\t\tjoining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes \n\t\t\t\t\tto marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; \n\t\t\t\t\tsenators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want \n\t\t\t\t\tto limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our \n\t\t\t\t\tindependence.\n\nWe don't complain -- we can't stand complainers --  but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our \n\t\t\t\t\thands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.\n\nWe're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. \n\t\t\t\t\tOur original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates \n\t\t\t\t\tthem -- because we won't bend the knee to political correctness.\n\nOne reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of \n\t\t\t\t\tour being, and we think she's worth saving from today's craziness.\n\nHelp us save her.\n\nA second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train.  We have \n\t\t\t\t\ttrained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political \n\t\t\t\t\tspectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There's a good chance they were trained at Daily \n\t\t\t\t\tCaller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, \n\t\t\t\t\tNewsmax, Daily Wire and many others.\n\nSimply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a \n\t\t\t\t\tfair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.\n\nSince 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. \n\t\t\t\t\tAnd we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible \n\t\t\t\t\tto ignore.\n\nWe can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can't do it unless you - \n\t\t\t\t\tthe everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment - have our back.\n\nPlease consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, \n\t\t\t\t\tcorporations and other leaders accountable.

      "text": "Donald J. Trump is a real estate mogul and television personality who in 2016 pulled off a historic political upset over the \" inevitable \" Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Trump was born in Queens, New York, on June 14, 1946 and received his bachelor's from Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He has been married three times, first to Ivana Trump (1977-1992), then to Marla Maples (1993-1999), and finally to Slovenia-born fashion model Melania Trump in 2005. From those marriages have sprung Trump's children: Donald Jr., Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron.\n\nTrump's Business Empire: Over the decades Trump built a global business empire, largely based on his real estate ventures, which include luxury hotels, resorts, and golf clubs. He owns or is stakeholder in properties in several states, including in California, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, and Virginia. He has started several businesses, some of which have flourished and others which have folded, like the for-profit Trump University, which during the 2016 campaign was beset by multiple lawsuits claiming fraud that were settled for $25 million soon after he became president in 2017. In addition to his properties, Trump sells or has sold ties, wine, steaks, and a wide range of other products. In February 2017, Forbes estimated Trump's net worth at around $3.5 billion . However, Trump estimates his own net worth at around three times that number - \"in excess of $10 billion dollars\" - among other things, citing his personal brand as being far more valuable than Forbes maintains.\n\nThe 2016 Election: From the start, Trump's unorthodox campaign was marked by controversy, in large part because of his refusal to obey the strictures of political correctness. Among the controversies, was his comment that many of those crossing the border illegally are \"rapists\" (a reference to reports that a large percentage of unaccompanied minors from Central and South America are raped on the journey to the U.S.). He also called for a temporary \"Muslim ban,\" arguing for a halt on admission of immigrants and refugees from the terrorism-plagued countries in the Middle East until better vetting procedures are installed. Trump's personal attacks on his opponents, both on the left and right, likewise earned him criticism. The result of the unprecedented campaign was widespread dismissal of Trump's chances by political insiders, pundits, and pollsters alike.\n\nDonald Trump became the 45th President of the United States on January 20, 2017. His defeat of Clinton on November 8, 2016, in which he garnered 306 electoral votes compared to Clinton's 232, is arguably the biggest upset in the history of the U.S. presidential election. Though polling groups and the national media had almost uniformly projected Clinton to defeat Trump rather easily, by a little after 9 p.m. EST on election night, The New York Times ' projection of the winner flipped on its head. By the end of the night, Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" campaign won over most of the Rust Belt and the key swing states, including Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nHow old is Donald Trump? Donald Trump was born on June 14, 1946.\n\nHow much is Donald Trump's net worth? According to Forbes, Donald Trump's net-worth was $3.5 billion in 2017. Around the same time, Donald Trump estimated his own net worth at over $10 billion.\n\nHow did Donald Trump make his money? Donald Trump made his money primarily through various real estate ventures, including luxury hotels, resorts, casinos, and golf clubs.\n\nHow many times has Donald Trump been married? Donald Trump has been married three times: to Ivana Trump (1977-1992), then to Mara Maples (1993-1999), and finally to Slovenia-born fashion model Melania Trump in 2005.\n\nWho are Donald Trump's children? Donald Trump has five children: Donald Trump Jr. (b. 1977), Ivanka Trump (b. 1981), Eric Trump (b. 1984), Tiffany Trump (b. 1993), and Barron Trump (b. 2006)."

Not to mention their popular home good lines with Food Network star names like Paula Deen and Ree Drummond, the Pioneer Woman.\n\nEach of these big moves, to buy and sell higher-end brands or popular online brands, are part of Walmart and Target's race to keep up with Amazon. The discount retailers may be well-known for catering to lower- and middle-income consumers, but their dependency on an expansive e-commerce portfolio is becoming evident.\n\nAfter Ivanka stepped down from her company to move to the White House, she retained the business through an independent trust, citing the importance of protecting the Trump name. \"Had I sold the business, an independent third party would be able to go around the globe today licensing and leveraging the name of the 45 th president of the United States of America-completely unfettered,\" she said in an interview with \" CBS This Morning .\"\n\nThe Trumps are protective of the family name, as it's what gives otherwise mediocre products and real estate more value.

      "text": "Art Exhibit Invites People To Throw Trash At Vacuuming Ivanka Trump Lookalike\n\nThe irony, of course, is that the exhibit reflects every stereotype feminists claim to stand against, oversexualizing Ivanka's body and ignoring her hard work.\n\n\"Ivanka Vacuuming\" is now a thing in the nation's capital. Because art, or something.\n\nThe exhibit, on display at CulturalDC's former Flashpoint Gallery in Washington, D.C., is a piece of \"performance art\" where an Ivanka Trump lookalike wearing a pink dress with bows and stiletto shoes vacuums crumbs off a plush, pink carpet. To make the spectacle interactive, onlookers are encouraged to take crumbs from a pedestal and throw them at her to vacuum up.\n\n\"Inspired by a figure whose public persona incorporates an almost comically wide range of feminine identities - daughter, wife, mother, sister, model, working woman, blonde - Ivanka Vacuuming is simultaneously a visual celebration of a contemporary feminine icon; a portrait of our own relationship to that figure; and a questioning of our complicity in her role-playing,\" a press release on the project reads. \"The public is invited to throw crumbs onto the carpet, watching as Ivanka elegantly vacuums up the mess, her smile never wavering. This process repeats itself for the entire duration of the performance.\"\n\nThe irony, of course, is that the exhibit reflects every stereotype feminists claim to stand against, oversexualizing Ivanka's body and ignoring her hard work. (One can only imagine the feminist rage if it were, say, Michelle Obama on display.)\n\nIn addition to mocking Ivanka for her looks, the exhibit demeans the First Daughter's success as a business woman and White House advisor to that of a woman with a vacuum-as if something's wrong with that, too. Worse, in the process of shaming stay-at-home mothers, \"Ivanka Vacuuming\" encourages onlookers to throw trash at her. Again, because \"art,\" or something.\n\nTherein lies the only interesting insight offered by artist Jennifer Rubell, who is of course female because no male could get away with such sexism masked as art.\n\n\"Here is what's complicated: we enjoy throwing the crumbs for Ivanka to vacuum. That is the icky truth at the center of the work. It's funny, it's pleasurable, it makes us feel powerful, and we want to do it more,\" Rubell said. \"We like having the power to elicit a specific and certain response. Also, we know she'll keep vacuuming whether we do it or not, so it's not really our fault, right?\"\n\nRubell is right that under President Donald Trump, Americans get a rise out of insulting the first daughter or anyone who dares to wear a MAGA hat. Therein lies the truth of this exhibit: There's far more wrong with the person who revels in hurling trash at others than there is with the person who's willing to pick it up.\n\nAnyone who cares enough to go see \"Ivanka Vacuuming\" or watch the spectacle on its livestream is likely too blinded by his own hate to realize the joke of the whole thing is actually on them. It's not Ivanka's vacuuming that's the problem, but the heart of the person who feels pleasure from bullying and humiliating others.\n\nIt's more than \"icky\" to feel this way. It's immoral. That is why, for \"Ivanka Vacuuming,\" the real exhibit worth going to see is the people throwing the crumbs, not the person picking them up.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

Get a life.\n\nThe New York Times is not happy that Ivanka Trump wore Indian-inspired garb during her diplomatic visit to India this week.\n\n\"While on the one hand it is nice to see someone in the Trump administration make an effort to leverage the possibilities of tactical dress, the interpretation was largely through the lens of the outsider looking in,\" Vanessa Friedman writes. \"The selections had echoes of orientalism and ornamentation. . . Instead of wearing work by a designer that spoke to the nuances of the country (a tactic adopted often by Michelle Obama, for example), Ms. Trump opted, at least initially, for the most obvious: clothes by outsiders who dipped into their fantasy of India as opposed to its reality.\"\n\nA post shared by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) on Nov 28, 2017 at 7:58am PST\n\nFriedman's outrage is rooted in a column by Bandana Tewari, an editor at Vogue India , who wrote: \"We would rather see her wear a hand-woven sari made in our country or a handmade gown made in her own country. But to hybridize the two, in an era of unfiltered diversity, is a superfluous nod to half-acceptance.\"\n\nThe article went on to compare Ivanka's look to that of former first lady Michelle Obama, whom both Vogue India and The New York Times say was so much better at wearing clothes that did not appropriate other cultures (something they assume is inherently evil). It seems these ladies forget that Michelle Obama's outfits caused controversy during overseas visits. Remember when she ruffled feathers by foregoing a headscarf in Saudi Arabia? As fashionable and classy as she was, Michelle O's outfits were the subject of equally dumb controversies.\n\nNot all, or even many, Indians seemed all that bothered by Ivanka's wardrobe, either. Let's take a look at a few other articles from Indian news sources, who praised Ivanka's look.\n\n\"During her visit to Hyderabad, Ivanka Trump was seen sporting elegant ensembles,\" an item at The Indian Express reads . \"From a beautiful red floral dress to a white ethnic dress, the US first daughter is a true fashionista.\"\n\nA post shared by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) on Nov 29, 2017 at 8:35am PST\n\nIn an India Today article, which Friedman cited in her piece for the Times , Ivanka was praised as an \"Indian Barbie doll\" - a pretty hard compliment to top.\n\nIvanka isn't the first dignitary to wear an Indian-style patterned dress by a western designer in India, either. As Michelle Honig at Forward points out, Kate Middleton wore a red Kashmiri-patterned dress by Alexander McQueen to a wreath-laying ceremony at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel last April. Middleton's similar look was not controversial. The Times chronicled the duchess of Cambridge's look in a slideshow with not as much as a raised eyebrow. It seems the Ivanka's outfit \"debacle\" has more to do with her last name than with what she actually wore.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

Yes, this is a self-described feminist telling another woman to initiate incestuous behavior in order to accomplish another woman's bidding.\n\n\"Put on something tight and low and tell your father to f-cking stop it. Tell him it was an Obama thing and see how to goes.\"\n\nBee, who identifies as a feminist, is just playing by the feminist rulebook, which has different standards of what is and isn't sexist to say about a woman depending entirely upon that woman's political leanings. She knows that casting blame on a woman for a man's actions is completely fine when the woman is (God forbid) related to a Republican. And telling her to wear something \"tight and low\" to get a man's attention (even when the man in question is her father) is totally fine  - so long as the targeted woman is conservative. It's also totally acceptable to attack a woman based on her looks , but only if that woman works for a Republican.\n\nBee's show was honored by the Television Academy this week for leveraging \"the dynamic power of television to inspire social change.\" See, even Hollywood knows she's a really good feminist! After all, this is the town that only took 40 years to expel Roman Polanski after he was convicted of raping a child.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

DOJ's grant recipients are on the frontlines of this fight, ensuring that survivors across our country are afforded safe and stable housing and empowered with the support and resources they need to rebuild their lives,\" said Ivanka Trump, adviser to the president.\n\nAmid recent government-mandated lockdowns and stay-at-home orders, many victims are living in quarantine with their traffickers, a senior White House official said.\n\n\"We're still in the data-gathering stage with our federal agencies, but the anecdotal stories that we're hearing are horrific,\" they said. \"Our NGO providers are doing more than ever before, and we are so grateful that they are answering the call to ensure that victims and survivors not only have housing, but have employment and have tangible resources such as food and transportation.\"\n\nOrganizations receiving grant money include nonprofits such as Camillus House in Miami, Alternatives for Girls in Detroit, and Jordan Community Resource Center in Shaker Heights, Ohio.\n\nIvanka Trump has made human trafficking one of her areas of focus, leading to President Donald Trump's appointment of a special adviser to combat human trafficking and an executive order issued in January expanding the federal government's investigating and prosecuting of human trafficking.\n\nAn estimated 12,400 sex trafficking transactions take place in Atlanta each month. Today I visited City of Refuge and Wellspring Living, 2 transformative organizations that protect the most vulnerable and provide transformative care through spiritual nurturing, therapeutic services, education, life skills and personal and professional development. These Atlanta safe havens provide women with the opportunity for rescue, restoration, and a chance to start a new life. The stories shared with us by survivors of human trafficking today were incredibly powerful. These women warriors represent resilience and strength on a level few of us will ever know. The entire Trump Administration is committed to combating this evil.\n\nA post shared by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) on Jan 14, 2020 at 6:34pm PST\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

And that's what infuriated me more than anything.\"\n\n\"I think it's a very sexist representation of a woman...\" @IvankaTrump to @HuntsmanAbby on a controversial art exhibit inviting people to throw crumbs at a model look-a-like of her. https://t.co/7De0ILNSwT pic.twitter.com/7YaBQBrU5c\n\n- Good Morning America (@GMA) February 8, 2019\n\nThe exhibit, livestreamed for everyone's viewing pleasure, is a piece of \"performance art\" where an Ivanka Trump lookalike wearing a pink dress with bows and stiletto shoes vacuums crumbs off a plush, pink carpet. To make the \"art\" interactive, onlookers are encouraged to take crumbs from a pedestal and throw them at her to vacuum up.\n\nWhen Ivanka first caught wind of the exhibit, she tweeted , \"Women can choose to knock each other down or build each other up. I choose the latter.\"\n\nWomen can choose to knock each other down or build each other up. I choose the latter. https://t.co/MFri4xKhNI\n\n- Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) February 5, 2019\n\nIn directing her ire towards the use of the 16-year-old model, Ivanka is practicing precisely what she preaches. Rather than criticizing the \"art\" and the artist herself (which is plenty easy to do), Ivanka is standing up for the teenager who's getting paid to have crumbs thrown at her. Even though she's playing a role, the job is still dehumanizing.\n\nArtist Jennifer Rubell, daughter of mega-collectors Mera and Don Rubell, responded to Ivanka's tweet with an invitation to see the charade in person. Because why wouldn't Ivanka, who's a mother, a wife, a business woman, and a White House senior advisor, want to spend her free time viewing \"art\" intended to bully and make fun of her?\n\nAs part of the invitation, Rubell made the bizarre claim that the exhibit is \"not knocking anyone down\"-as if it's empowering in some way.\n\n\"Ivanka, I would encourage you to see the piece and form your own direct response,\" Rubell tweeted . \"I would be happy to arrange for you to do it alone with none of the media circus that has formed around it. Not knocking anyone down. Exploring complicated subjects we all care about.\"\n\nIn an interview with Refinery29 , Rubell further attempted to defend herself from the obvious criticism that her work reflects every stereotype feminists claim to stand against. The exhibit, she said, is \"open to interpretation.\" (As if anyone thinks \"Ivanka Vacuuming\" was flattering in some way.)\n\n\"First of all, people aren't throwing crumbs at her,\" Rubell told Refinery29. \"She's vacuuming them up from the carpet. You're participating in this act of subjugation, that's true, but the piece is not 'Ivanka vacuuming,' it's a combination of that and the participating viewer. ... It puts the viewer in a very complicated position. And I'm most interested in the complications of the viewer; how they decide to engage with this feminine figure. What does it mean to either throw crumbs, or stand there watching other people throwing crumbs?\"\n\nIt's true that viewers are participating in the Ivanka model's subjugation, which is why I was quick to point out the real exhibit worth going to see is the people throwing the crumbs, not the person picking them up.\n\nBut that doesn't make the exhibit itself, or the job of the 16-year-old model, any less demeaning. And it doesn't erase the double standard once again demonstrated by the Left.\n\nIt's obvious that \"Ivanka Vacuuming\" is nothing more than another attempt to slight the president and his supporters. But it's curious why, despite all the men who surround President Trump, a self-proclaimed feminist would pick on a woman to make her political statement. I guess \"Jared Vacuuming,\" just didn't ring.\n\nThe good news is, as a senior White House advisor, Ivanka Trump has far more influence over young women than Rubell ever will. And instead of knocking them down, she's focusing on building up non-employed and working women alike.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "Trump makes a play for the female vote at women's-only town hall in battleground Georgia, vows to make communities safer to raise families\n\nThe all-female audience seemed to agree on one thing: they were better off when Trump was president.\n\nThe all-female audience seemed to agree on one thing: they were better off when Trump was president.\n\nThe Republican nominee spent the evening fielding questions from single moms, grandmothers, and immigrants, clarifying his positions on women's rights and issues such as the economy, child care, public safety, immigration, abortion, and men competing in women's sports. Mainstream media pundits and Democratic politicians have long painted Trump as anti-women , but those who attended the event appeared to have a different view of the president. Chants of \"Fight! Fight! Fight!\" echoed off the wooden panels as Trump entered the barnyard. It wasn't long before a single mom of two kids walked behind the podium to discuss the hardships her family has endured under the Biden-Harris economy, particularly when it comes to child care. The mother from Milton told Trump that her child tax credit has decreased by nearly 80 percent over the last three years, and the lowest cost of daycare for one child is $1,400 per month. She stated that she could no longer afford to keep up with the costs due to inflation and other economic concerns, and asked the GOP nominee to explain what adjustments he would make so parents could more easily afford to have kids in today's society. President Donald Trump sat down for a women's-only Town Hall hosted by Fox News' Harris Faulkner. Courtesy: David Avant President Trump considered affordable child care to be a top priority, explaining that he doubled the child tax credit with the help of his more liberal daughter, Ivanka Trump, under his presidency. Trump asserted that he supports another generous child tax credit, saying, \"It's something we have to get done.\" Both Trump and his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, have proposed child tax credits on the campaign trail. Trump's child tax credits would provide $5,000 per child to all families, regardless of income, whereas Harris proposed $3,600 per child for low-income families only, a former Biden-Harris administration policy she said she wants to restore. The 45th president, an ex-Democrat who has more moderate views, reiterated his pro-abortion stance to the crowd, despite mainstream media and Democratic lawmakers falsely accusing Trump of having the goal to impose a national abortion ban. He said the decision is now up to the states, saying that he believes some Republican-run states have enacted laws that are \"too tough\" on abortion and indicated they would likely be redone. Trump said the topic of abortion \"has torn apart our country for 52 years.\" When it comes to another issue important to women, Trump told a mother of three who struggled with infertility that he wholeheartedly supports IVF treatments and is outwardly against any state that would attempt to ban them. The GOP nominee has at least one child who was conceived through IVF and said Republicans are \"totally in favor\" of the treatments, explaining that conservatives are pro-family and want to increase the number of children they have. While on the campaign trail last month, Trump vowed to have IVF treatments covered by either taxpayers or through insurance. Women gathered outside the Reid Barn in Cumming, Georgia, to hear President Trump address women's issues. Courtesy: Katie Daviscourt/The Post Millennial The women in the audience were also concerned about public safety, particularly the rise in violent crime following the defund the police movement in 2020 and illegal immigration. Trump viewed restoring public safety to be a primary goal of his presidency, claiming that he is the law and order candidate who has the full support of law enforcement agencies across the United States. The candidate said he wants parents to be able to raise their children in safe communities. A mother of a college student who attended the same university as Laken Riley , a 22-year-old woman who was brutally murdered by an illegal immigrant while going out for a run near campus earlier this year, asked President Trump how quickly he could remove the migrant criminals from the United States so Americans could feel safe in their communities again. Trump vowed to end Democrat-run sanctuary cities through the help of both local and federal law enforcement, telling the mother that when he was president \"the border was the safest it ever was in the history of our country.\" But perhaps the most simple policy answer Trump gave pertained to concerns about trans-identified biological men competing in women's sports, which he vowed to ban, explaining, \"You just ban it. The president bans it, and it gets banned.\" The exclusive Town Hall was hosted by Fox News' Harris Faulkner, which brought hundreds of American women to the little town just northeast of Atlanta. Women make up the largest group of active and registered voters in the United States, and the intimate setting gave the 45th president the opportunity to try to win their vote, just weeks ahead of the election. Faulkner served as a moderator while women from all different backgrounds addressed the former president one by one, vying to gain a better understanding of why women should vote for Trump instead of his female challenger, Kamala Harris. President Trump made a play for the female vote in battleground Georgia. Courtesy: David Avant While Kamala Harris has the possibility to become the first female US president, it was obvious throughout the evening that not all women are seduced by identity politics, with some opposing Harris' candidacy despite her gender. However, data shows that women are presently driving Vice President Harris' slim 3-point edge over Trump. But, Trump has a commanding lead among male voters, a demographic in which Harris has struggled to gain traction. The Trump campaign has mostly appealed to male voters, therefore increasing Trump's appeal to women is vital for a Trump-Vance victory.\n\nPowered by The Post Millennial CMSTM Comments\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.

Full Frontal 's low ratings were highlighted in 2021 and 2022 when Gutfield ! on Fox News began consistently beating its late night competition.

Weitz had been Bee's defender over the past several years.\n\nDeadline wrote that Bee's cancellation \"is a blow for diversity in the late-night space\"\n\nAccording to Variety , Bee brought an \"aggressive and saucy voice\" to late night and was \"one of the few programs led by a female point-of-view.\"\n\nIn 2018 Samantha Bee called Ivanka Trump a \"feckless c*nt\" for not pressuring her father, then President Donald Trump, to govern the way Bee wanted .\n\nTBS said in a statement, \"As we continue to shape our new programming strategy, we've made some difficult, business-based decisions.

In June, Miner posted a mask selfie that boldly emblazoned an American-designed skull donning President Donald Trump's signature blonde hairstyle. \"The sole redeeming aspect of the oppressive mandate to wear a mask is the great number of times a day I pull it off and appreciate the smell of freedom.\" In addition, a photoshopped image of Trump's head on a rockstar brands the owner's Facebook profile picture.\n\nThen in April, Miner called liberalism and the victim mentality \"mental disorders\" in accordance with a Land O' Lakes meme that criticized \"how American\" it is that leftists \"got rid of the Indian and kept the land.\"\n\nThe week of the expose, Miner wrote \"hard pass\" to climate change mitigations in his daily life. Days later, Miner sent his quarterly taxes to the \"commie government\" with a post-it note attached: \"Please direct all funds to the police so I can stop being burgled!\"\n\n\"Get your booze elsewhere. F**k D*nald Tr*mp,\" the anti-fascist 86 the Abuse captioned the smear campaign of Miner.\n\nHollywood Beverage NE Sandy. Get your booze elsewhere.

Burglars called theft \"reparations,\" while hard-working residents feared for their livelihoods dismantled by the mob.\n\nStill over the summer, protesters in Kenosha set \"much of the black business district\" ablaze when rioters rampaged over the white-on-black police shooting of Jacob Blake .\n\nDuring the first and only vice presidential debate Wednesday night, Vice President Mike Pence named his guest, the owner of a Minneapolis hair salon shop that was destroyed amid the Minneapolis riots. In the wake of George Floyd's death, her shop was torched even though \"Black owned\" was spray painted on the exterior.\n\nFlora Westbrook, the owner of Flora's Hair Design, showed the wreckage to Pence and Ivanka Trump while on their last month trip to promote Trump's law-and-order message in Minnesota.\n\n\"Just a few weeks ago, I stood at what used to be her salon that was burned to the ground by rioters and looters. And Flora is still trying to put her life back together,\" Pence explained.\n\nThis comes as Yelp-a crowd-sourced platform for reviews-released a new consumer alert system \"against racism\" on Friday. \"In the last few months, we've seen that there is a clear need to warn consumers about businesses associated with egregious, racially-charged actions to help people make more informed spending decisions.\"\n\nToday, we're announcing a new consumer alert to stand against racism.
