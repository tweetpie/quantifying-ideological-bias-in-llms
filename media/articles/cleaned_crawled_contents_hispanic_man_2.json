      "text": "The Truth About \"Macho\" Men\n\nLatinos and other men from traditionally \"sexist cultures\" don't have a monopoly on machismo, so why is it that they're so often scapegoated for backwards attitudes when it comes to gender? How can entire continents and counties be compromised of completely chauvinistic men? And where does this \"macho\" the media insists on perpetuating come from?\n\nCelia Falicov, PhD, author of Latino Families in Therapy, points to the work of Matthew Gutmann , who traced the rise of this figure to the Golden Era of Mexican cinema in the 1950s. These movies, Falicov says, glorified certain macho qualities, such as gun slinging and objectifying women. According to Falicov, although these movies showed both the negative and positive qualities of machismo, the negative traits were the ones that were glorified and have really endured. Many still continue to permeate the media's representation of Latino men.\n\nMachismo, Falicov says, is the greatest representation of patriarchy while sexism is the milder representation of male dominance. In her article Changing Constructions of Machismo for Latino Men in Therapy: ''The Devil Never Sleeps , she writes: \"the better man is the one who can drink the most, sire the most sons, defend himself the most, dominate his wife, and command the absolute respect of his children. It is also part of the configuration to have strong sexual drives and seek variety in sexual relationships, while being possessive and jealous toward the faithful wife.\"\n\nThere is no denying that machismo is detrimental and often deadly for women, and failing to understanding the origins, nuances, and contexts is a disservice to everyone. Falicov and other mental health experts feel there needs to be a more comprehensive and less stereotypical definition.\n\nDr. Yobany Pardo, lead researcher of the study Machismo and Marital Satisfaction in Mexican American Couples , says that the traditional definition of a macho is a domineering, controlling, chauvinistic type of male, but he's \"arguing for a less stereotyped definition, one more congruent with real characteristics.\" He believes that we should be looking at specific behaviors in specific scenarios for a newer, more accurate definition, one that is both social-cultural driven and contextual.\n\nHis study, for instance, found that wives' endorsement of positive machismo beliefs was associated with higher levels of their own marital satisfaction, while moderate levels of positive machismo were associated with higher levels of marital satisfaction for husbands.\n\nPardo believes that his study's findings demonstrate \"a more nuanced understanding of positive and negative machismo and challenge stereotypical notions of machismo still prevalent in popular culture and research as intrinsically pathological.\" Part of the problem may be that the effects of machismo on the marital satisfaction has not been studied sufficiently. According to Pardo's study, the field of marriage and family research with Latinos in the U.S. was completely underdeveloped in the 80s and 90s.\n\nPardo and Falicov believe that caballerismo, which consists of positive aspects and traits, is a often overlooked when addressing machismo. Pardo points out that protectiveness, leadership, and participating in the education, for instance are all part of caballerismo . \"It involves caring for partner and family and feeling that it's honorable,\" he says.\n\nAccording to Pardo's study, extreme dominance and lack of gentlemanly traits reduce the satisfaction that husbands and wives experience in a relationship. Contrary to the common one-dimensional portrayal, Pardo found that in Mexican families, \"ideologies of honor have been found to simultaneously protect women from spousal abuse and at the same time empower men to act violently.\"\n\nHe also points out that sometimes positive and negative views can conflict in the same person. \"In extreme cases you will have couples who can't deal with conflict because there's no compromise,\" he says. \"Usually, I'll ask them to recognize the challenges in maintaining that status. It's taxing. It may work for him, but not the system. If a man endorses a lot of positive attributes, it's important to help him recognize and appreciate those traits. I don't think there's a man who only has negative attributes.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the issue of machismo, much of the discourse is justifiably centered on the ways it affects women; however, by ignoring the negative influence of these attitudes on men, it's difficult to effectively dismantle these damaging ideologies. If men are the often the perpetrators of violence and oppression, it makes sense to examine how machismo can also wound their psyches.\n\nOswaldo Neri, who grew up in a strict Catholic home, says that his father's machismo created a severe distance between them. Even as an adult, his relationship with his father continues to be strained. \"I feel like they [his parents] didn't give me the tools to deal with emotions or sex,\" he says. \"I had to navigate my way alone as a Hispanic man.\" Neri believes that because he was not equipped to compromise or to be vulnerable, he prematurely abandoned many of his relationships.\n\nNeri says the media also plays a big role in perpetuating unhealthy attitudes about men. \"It's promoting the idea that you're incomplete with out material things and a pretty girl.\" While women are grossly objectified, of course, men are victims, too, he says. If men are not successful, handsome, and posses the right cars, clothes, and phone, for instance, they are seen as failures, \"Your humanity is reduced to that of a consumer. Without your 'manhood,' you're nobody,\" he says.\n\n\"It's an act to fool others,\" says Joe Putignano, model and author of Acrobaddict: A Contortionist's Heroin Romance . \"People who are doing it are extremely detached emotionally.\" Putignano says his relationship with his absent alcoholic father had a profound affect on his romantic relationships with men.\n\n\"We're trying to mimic straight relationships because that's all we have,\" he says. \"There hasn't been enough time to establish or define what two men bring.\" Putignano gives the example of one of his previous partners who was sexually aggressive because he felt he was \"supposed to be a man.\" As a result, Putignano says he was not in tune with his needs. \"Two people are instruments and they're there to make music,\" he says.\n\nWhen it comes to the media, he says, \"That's a beast that probably will never change, but my hope is that people are waking up.\"\n\n\"Men are silent sufferers,\" agrees Robert de Leon. \"Men have to live up to this standard portrayed in the media, the idea of being 'a real man.' We definitely don't want this label for men. We're all going to have different characteristics.\"\n\nde Leon witnessed a dangerous form of machismo while growing up. His father was so physically abusive towards his mother that she often feared for her life. \"I grew up with this feeling that I never wanted to be like my dad,\" he says. \"I didn't want to relive the things I saw and have my kids one day see that.\"\n\nBut de LeÃ3n says he could not completely escape that macho mentality. While he was never physically abusive, he describes his former self as a \"typical guy\" who felt a sense of ownership over the women he dated.\n\nBecause de Leon was eventually able to transform his notions of masculinity, he founded Bromodels to share this knowledge with other young men. The program is dedicated to \"engaging and mobilizing men and boys to prevent violence before it starts\" and de Leon and his friends offer free workshops in schools and in the community.\n\n\"The program is a chance to express who they really are,\" he says. \"It's a life-changing and life -saving experience.\" de Leon hopes to receive funding to expand their programming and reach more young men. \"Liberation, that's what I feel when I share this love with other men,\" he says. \"These actions should not be multigenerational because we have the choice. We need to stop the cycle of abuse.\"\n\nFalicov has also noticed that attitudes are rapidly shifting, partly, she says, due to women's liberation and laws against domestic violence. She believes machismo is becoming increasingly less acceptable both in the US and other other counties. Most of her male clients, Falicov adds, are also willing to participate in therapy if they know it will benefit their families.\n\n\"You cannot have a whole continent of men classified this way without understanding deeply what's going on,\" she says"

      "text": "After Almost Three Violent Decades of Racism, Movement Leader Explains Why She's Calling It Quits\n\nBarely into her teens, Lynette Sonya Avrin was drawn into the skinhead movement in the early 1980s in Denver, which at the time was a real hotbed of racist activism. An angry young woman who felt that her parents essentially abandoned her, Avrin witnessed an enormous amount of violence and experienced a good deal of it herself. She also knew some of the most infamous activists of the era. But after she had two children and a long series of bad experiences with her supposed friends, she began to have doubts about her ideology and lifestyle. The turning point, she says, came in 2009, when a confrontation with a neo-Nazi boyfriend landed her in the hospital and terrified her then-10-year-old son. Today, she is raising that son in Colorado. Avrin, now 45, contacted the Intelligence Report after spotting an article about women on the radical right, \"Secrets of the Sisterhood,\" that mentioned her in the Report's Spring 2013 issue. She wanted to tell her story and to explain how completely she now rejects the racist movement. In the following interview, Avrin discusses how she came to join the movement, what it was like, and why she finally left.\n\nLynette, can you start by describing your early life in the Denver area?\n\nMy parents got a divorce when I was 4, and I remember it. That was the point in life where I think I basically started getting angry. My mom had custody of us but we were pretty much brought up by nannies and housekeepers or my brothers. She was never around. She was out dating men or whatever she was doing. I remember her bringing home a man who she dated for years. I really liked him, but he had a cake in one hand and a kitty in the other, and I'm thinking, \"Who is this guy and why is he trying to bribe us? You're not my dad, you know.\"\n\nI was a pretty wild child. I was one of those kids who was brought home by the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Department - even at age 4, I would run away. I usually just went to a neighbor's house to play, but I didn't tell anyone.\n\nMy dad got custody of us finally when I was around 10, and then he told us, \"Hey, I've got a new girlfriend.\" It was my mother's ex-best friend.\n\nThey had housekeepers take care of us, too, because if they weren't working, then they were traveling to Europe. So we had another set of parents that weren't really around. And here comes my dad telling me what to do and I'm like, \"Where have you been?\"\n\nWhat was your dad like?\n\nHe was a physicist and a scientist, a very smart man. He built an instrument called a nephelometer that measured the surface of Jupiter. He's retired now, and my stepmother passed away about a month ago. I haven't really spoken to him in probably 15 years.\n\nWe didn't have the best relationship. He would tell me, \"You're grounded,\" and I basically would say F you, and I was gone. I wouldn't listen to him. At around 12 or 13, I got into the whole punk rock scene in downtown Denver. I had the Mohawk and all that stuff and then I started to get interested in the skinhead thing. That's when they were pretty big in Denver.\n\nEventually, he was like, \"I give up. Do whatever you want.\" That's not what I wanted to hear, but I decided to do what the hell I wanted and I did.\n\nWere either of your parents racists?\n\nNo, not at all. There was no racism in our house. I think I was just so full of hate for other reasons that I thought, \"These skinheads are totally right.\"\n\nOnce, when we were at a restaurant, there was a black guy and a white girl and my mom said, \"I'm sure her parents must be thrilled.\" But that was the only time I heard anything like that. My parents told me as I got older, \"You don't have to take on the Jewish religion - just respect our religion. You can be whatever you want.\"\n\nWhat was attractive about the skinheads?\n\nI didn't feel like I had any control in my life. But as a skinhead, people were afraid of me. I mean, I was all of 4-foot-9, and people were afraid of me. It made me feel like I was in control, like I had some power.\n\nI thought this is my family and these guys are going to take care of me forever. It was just like creating another family. I really didn't feel like I had a family because I was adopted, and I felt at the time that they just didn't like me very much.\n\nI didn't get a lot of the ideology stuff, but we did get a lot of the violence. I'd hear, \"Negroes cause all this crime, Mexicans are all coming over here to our country.\" They'd say, \"Jews are taking over the whole country,\" and I'd think to myself, \"But my parents are Jewish and they don't act like that at all.\" I was like, \"I don't understand,\" but of course I was young, so I was like, \"Okay. I get it, yeah.\"\n\nThey didn't really educate us as to why they felt that way. It was all about violence, \"Let's go see who we can beat up tonight.\"\n\nI don't really think in my heart that I truly hated anybody. I just think I got involved and they kind of brainwashed me and it went on like that.\n\nWhat kind of violence did you experience then?\n\nWhen I was young, skinheads would beat up other, newbie skinheads. You had to prove you were really a skinhead. I remember a huge skinhead girl who had a much smaller one on the ground, saying, \"Lick my boots.\" I didn't want to get in the middle because I liked them both. But I should have stood up for my smaller friend. When it was over, she said, \"Thanks,\" and she never really talked to me again.\n\nThere were what people called \"boot parties.\" They'd take somebody and five or six skinheads would just kick the crap out of them, kick them in the face. Once up in Boulder, there was an Asian girl with a white guy and a bunch of people I was with just beat the crap out of them. They had the guy against a car and were just punching him in the face with brass knuckles. They got away with it, too.\n\nYou left Denver after high school, right?\n\nYes, right after high school. I moved out to Grandview, Mo., with a skinhead guy. The scene out there was different. They had SHARPs [Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice] and \"straight-edge\" skinheads [straight-edgers, who can be racist or non-racist, oppose all drug use], and we all kind of meshed. We used to go see shows down in North Kansas and drink beer and stuff. But we never went out and beat people up and there wasn't much discussion of race. It was kind of a neat little group that we had.\n\nAfter Missouri, I went back to Colorado for a while and was back hanging out with the Denver Skins. I used to hang out with one notorious skin there in particular. We'd drink beer on the front porch, and these little black kids would be running around laughing at us, and we'd chase them with a fire extinguisher. \"Let's see if we can paint them white,\" you know. We didn't actually catch up with any of them. But we had rocks thrown through our window, we had Crips checking out our house and following us home.\n\nWhat happened next?\n\nA bunch of us got the idea in our heads to move to Florida because some skinheads came up from there. It was like, \"You know, there's nothing here in Denver, this scene is kind of shot.\" I ended up staying down there for a year. It was a pretty violent scene. We would go out and look for anti-racist skinheads and beat them up.\n\nI remember driving down the street and one of my friends was like, \"Hey, look at that fag over there. He looked at me funny.\" They beat him up so badly that he couldn't identify any of the people there. It was a bad scene.\n\nI was in Florida for about a year and then accidentally ended up in Albuquerque, N.M. We were in Nashville, Tenn., going to beat up the lead singer of a band - I don't even remember why we didn't like him - and our car broke down. Here comes this van with Mark Kowalski waving at us. [Editor's note: About a year later, in July 1993, Kowalski led a racist terror gang that bombed an NAACP office in Tacoma, Wash., as part of a plot to start a race war. He was sentenced to almost 12 years in prison.] We ended up with them driving across the country, getting stopped every chance a cop had.\n\nMark is an extremely violent psychopath. Everywhere we went, if someone was playing their music loudly in a car, he would smash the window and beat him up with a crowbar.\n\nYou had some rough times in Albuquerque.\n\nThe worst thing happened there when we went to a 7-Eleven on a Sunday. We wanted some beer, and Mark smashed the case and we all grabbed beer and took off. We were drinking and, the next thing I know, there were these two Native American guys, and one had a gun. I don't know what started the fight but the next thing I know one of our friends was on the back of a Native American man beating him in the head with a ball-peen hammer. Then they beat the guy with his own gun. We were all dragged down to the homicide unit, but they let us go. It was so bad, the violence was starting to get to me at that point.\n\nAnother time, we went to a show and Mark had a knife in his flight jacket that I had no idea about. There were a lot of SHARPs there, and Mark got up and grabbed the microphone and said, \"I'm a white nationalist skinhead. Anybody got a problem with that?\" Of course, they did. I was outside with a girl drinking, and he's inside stabbing people. The entire club started emptying out and somebody punched Mark in the head. We jumped in a friend's car and, like in a movie, the car died in the middle of the crowd. We had about 100 angry skins jumping on the car.\n\nThe police came and took Mark off to jail. I went to Arizona for a little while, but ended up going to back to Albuquerque, where I met my daughter's father. I lived there for about 10 years. I grew my hair out and stayed away from the whole skinhead scene. My daughter was born there in 1993, but went to stay with her grandparents for a really long time. My son was also born in Albuquerque, when I was 27. It was when he was a baby that we got our first computer. I got hooked on Stormfront [the world's largest racist Web forum], White Aryan Resistance [another racist website]. I wasn't really doing anything between 1999 and 2008 except posting on Stormfront. That's where I got my \"education\" - they throw these statistics [about race] at you.\n\nEventually, we moved back to Colorado. Unfortunately, my husband was an alcoholic and that's what caused our divorce. Through Stormfront, I met this guy, Jeromy Drumm, who was in California. I thought he was this great guy. [Editor's note: Drumm was a member of the neo-Nazi National Alliance.] In 2009, my mother passed away and I decided to move out to California to live with this guy. My son and I brought our cats out and everything. My daughter was living with her father.\n\nThe Alliance was the first group you formally joined, isn't that right?\n\nYes. We used to have a monthly meeting at a secret place, some restaurant. We'd go to gun shows and pass out literature, talk about getting white nationalists to run for congressman or something. I met Jim Ring [the Alliance's Sacramento unit leader] and also got to know Erich Gliebe [the Alliance's national leader].\n\nWhat was Gliebe like?\n\nI spoke to him on the phone a few times and that guy is really slimy. He finds these women and sends them text messages about how pretty they are, then asks them out on dates. He kind of reminds me of Lurch. He was more interested in seeing how quickly he could get me into his bed than anything else.\n\n[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_large\",\"fid\":\"576477\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"height\":\"320\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\",\"width\":\"480\"}}]]\n\nAnd how did it go with Drumm?\n\nJer's mother abandoned him when he was three and he has a deep hatred for women. But he can be very charming.\n\nIt started with little things. He tried to blame these little marks on our wooden floor on my son. One day the butcher knife disappeared. Then my cats started disappearing. It took me a while to recognize how crazy he was. I think he was planning to do something to me and my son.\n\nOne day, I was talking to a friend on Facebook and I called him \"sweetheart.\" Jeromy went insane. He had already basically taken $6,000 my mother left me. He said, \"You need to leave,\" and I said, \"I think we will.\" But I told him I needed like four days because I had no money and was waiting on child support.\n\nThe night before I was supposed to leave, I was on the back porch smoking and he said, \"You know what? When your daughter turns 18, I'm going to have her come live with me.\" I spit in his face. He was basically telling me he was going to bring my daughter to his home and do things to her.\n\nHe pushed me so hard I flew probably three feet. Now, Jeromy is six feet, maybe a little taller, and about 215 pounds, and I'm 125 pounds and 5-foot-2. He grabbed me and was carrying me sideways through the house, smashing me along the walls. He threw me in the bathroom and tried to lock me in there. I stuck my hand through the door and he slams this metal door on my arm probably 10 times. I had this huge contusion, and told my son, who was 10, \"Call the police right now.\" He comes out and sees my arm and, oh, Lord, it was bad. It was horrible.\n\nAnd what happened?\n\nWhile we were waiting, Jer is videotaping me and calling the police himself and telling them that he had been assaulted, because he banged his head on a door and had these two little scratches on his forehead. Later, he went on Facebook and basically said I was a drunk, I was horrible to my child, I'm the one that beat him up, and that I was a \"cop caller.\" And all these people who had been my friends for all these years believed him.\n\nWhen the police arrived, their basic thing was, \"Well, hey, you're leaving, you're going back to Colorado, so we aren't going to press any charges.\" They took me to the hospital. When I got out about four in the morning, my son and I took a cab back and Jer had my Jeep all nice and packed for me.\n\nWe ended up in a domestic violence shelter in Colorado and then in transitional housing for a few years.\n\nSo how did your break with white nationalism finally happen?\n\nI realized that nobody I knew really cared. I thought I had this family all these years. That's obviously a complete lie, because they don't care. They'll turn their backs on you in a split second. They'll stab you in the back.\n\nThey claim that \"we love our race,\" that it has nothing to do with hate. But it has everything to do with hate. I was realizing that I don't want my children to grow up this way. I saw my friends teaching this to their children at age three. What does a child know about hate? Their parents think it's okay to teach them that, and I don't think it's okay at all. Even when I was a skinhead, I always told my son, \"You be friends with whoever you want.\" I didn't push my beliefs on him.\n\nHe never wanted anything to do with it. And he's a great kid. He just started a new school and he's in ROTC. He's got not one hateful bone in his body. I mean nothing. He's got Hispanic friends. He's got black friends. He's got Jewish friends. And my daughter was married to a Hispanic man, a very, very nice guy.\n\nThere are other reasons. These white nationalists glorified it when Trayvon Martin was killed. [Editor's note: Martin was shot to death in 2012 by a white Florida man who claimed he felt threatened by the unarmed, black 17-year-old.] It was huge. I actually went on Stormfront and said, \"How dare you celebrate the death of a child?\"\n\nI said, \"You know what, I don't need this because I don't believe in it any more.\" That was the end of it and I was done.\n\nLynette, what would you say to young people flirting with white nationalism?\n\nI would tell them, \"Don't do it. It's so stupid, why would you want to do this?\" But when I think about it, when people would say things like that to me, I was like, \"F you. I'm going to do whatever I want.\" It's sad, but maybe they have to find out on their own. If they can't find a positive mentor in life, then they may be stuck on that same road that I was on for years no matter what people said to me.\n\nI honestly wonder, would people listen to me if I went to a school and said, \"You know, I used to be a skinhead\"? It's hard to say what I would say to them. You can try and say really honestly that this isn't a smart path to go down. I could tell them that half the people I knew are dead or in prison. I don't know what I could say. I did it the hard way. I had to find out for myself.\n\nIt amazes me now that we're in 2014 and prejudice and racism still has not gone away. With gay marriages and other things, it should be gone. I tell my son I don't care if somebody is gay. So they are gay. Let them be married.\n\nIt's been a really long road, but now I'm done with it. Carrying around hate your whole life is just not healthy. It can make you sick. How can somebody claim to love themselves if they hate people? You need to just look at people as people. That took me a long time to figure out, but I'm pretty glad I did."

      "text": "The Anti-Immigrant Paranoia That Drives Shawna Forde to 'Patrol' the American Border\n\nThe following is an excerpt from David Neiwert's new book \" And Hell Followed with Her: Crossing the Dark Side of the American Border \" (Perseus Books, 2013), an inside look at the paranoid and  anti-immigrant extremists known as the \"Minutemen\" and the terrifying story and psychology of movement leader Shawna Forde.\n\nShawna and the Belgian documentary maker have been talking music. Grunge rock, specifically. Nirvana, even more specifically. Shawna has been telling him how she knew Kurt Cobain personally. As he films her, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" comes up on the CD player in Shawna's Honda Element. They are sitting out in the Arizona desert. He asks her to name her favorite Nirvana song.\n\n\"I like a lot of them, but I love 'Teen Spirit,'\" she says. \"I really do. I love 'Teen Spirit.' That was like his first hit. His big one, you know?\"\n\nShe pauses briefly, thinking. \"I like all of 'em. Because if you listen to the words behind it-and he always talks about killing himself or shooting himself-because he was always really infatuated with death. But he never thought he would kill himself. I don't think he ever thought he was going to kill himself. But I think everyone knew he would eventually.\"\n\nSebastien Wielemans had written to Shawna several weeks before organizing the trip from Brussels to Arizona. He was employed by a Canadian broadcaster making short documentaries and was intrigued by the idea of a border project. He arrived at Shawna's camp south of Three Points in mid-October 2008.\n\nAs with the Nirvana talk, much of what Shawna says on the resulting video is pure bullshit, intended to impress her international audience. Shawna emphasizes her concern for rape victims and the women crossing the border, and she talks about how all the Minutemen want to do is \"save the country.\"\n\nThere is a rare glimpse of honesty from Shawna, however, when she talks about why she goes out on border watches: \"It's an adrenaline rush. You get addicted to it. It's an addiction. I'm an addict. I'm an adrenaline junkie.\" She giggles at that, then turns serious.\n\n\"So, you know, what do you say? I mean seriously. I think once you've lived certain ways, it's really hard to go and be humdrum. OK, I'm just going to sit at home, or I'm just going to work my nine to five Monday through Friday and have my weekends off, and in the evening I'll watch my favorite TV show and I'll go to bed by ten p.m. I mean, who-I'll never live that way. I'd rather die. I'd rather die. Put a bullet in my head. Because-forget it. Because to me, that would be death to me too.\"\n\nAs it happened, her husband, John Forde, agreed. He had just filed for divorce from her that week.\n\nAfter Shawna's jaunts down to the desert in August 2007, John Forde had pretty much had his fill of his absentee marriage. He gave Shawna an ultimatum: either she started acting like a wife and contributing to their household instead of running off to the desert, or he would divorce her. Forde says he wanted to stay married, but it was up to Shawna to change things. And for awhile, she did; for much of the late part of 2007, she backed out of Minuteman activities.\n\nIn the meantime, she continued her pattern of getting into trouble and then claiming victimhood. \"Every single time it was always somebody else's fault,\" John recalls. \"It was never Shawna's fault.\"\n\nShawna worked for awhile at the Sears hair salon at the mall in Lynnwood. During that time, she kept coming home with Sears goods, including a large painting and various tools and gewgaws. John asked where she was getting it all, and she claimed it was all on the square.\n\nThen one day she came home and grabbed everything she had brought home from Sears and put it in the car and had John drive her to the mall. She now explained that it really was all stuff that she'd purchased using her friend's employee discount, and that she wasn't going to let her friend get into trouble. She said that she'd worked it all out with the security people and everything was taken care of.\n\nJohn, naturally, knew better than to believe her: \"I kept saying, Shawna, everything is drama here.\"\n\nEven more dismaying to John was the transformation in his wife since she had joined the Minutemen. He attended a couple of their gatherings, including an MCDC event in Yakima and the Immigration Summit at the Elks Lodge. He walked out of that one after about an hour: \"It just wasn't my scene.\"\n\nThe vitriol the movement promoted bothered him the most. \"It just is disgusting, the anger,\" he says. \"I wanted to help her, but it is not my cup of tea to run around and do battle and be angry.\"\n\nIt obviously was Shawna's. Gradually there was an increase in Shawna's venom: \"She began to get filled with hate and using the n-word,\" he says. It got to the point that he told her, \"You aren't the person I knew.\"\n\nShe was giving voice to these sentiments on her blog-titled \"Shawna's Corner\" and written in her inimitably semi-illiterate style-at the MAD website. \"See, there is a new white girl in town ... this one is not afraid and will not tolerate this, not while I'm on post,\" she wrote. \"We can all live in fear or we stand strong and tall and look the criminals in the eye and say 'No more.' I did not get involved in this movement to be a wallflower and as most of you know me you know I'm a hands on kind of gal. We have to do this so if you have area's that are known to be [drug] traffic area's and full of illegal's make a stand start with local law enforcement, take pictures and build a case file.\"\n\nA vein of ethnic hatred and paranoia emerged as well. She began making offhanded remarks about \"subhuman Mexicans.\" \"After they cross the border,\" she wrote of immigrants, \"they are taking over area's of our cities, neighborhoods, schools with their way of life witch is: 1 Corruption 2 Lie's 3 Drug dealer 4 welfare fraud 5 stealing 6 Filthiness 7 Gang code of ethics 8 violence 9 no respect for existing Americans 10 Hate. I could continue this list I have seen first hand and have been getting to know people in the Hispanic community so that when they say we should respect the plight of these pour people do not be fooled for one moment they think we are weak and stupid plus we don't speak their language so they operate their own life styles under the radar. I would say 90% of all patrons here are illegal some just got her yesterday. These are not proud people they are nothing more than thugs.\"\n\nThe hiatus from the Minutemen ended soon after Jim Gilchrist named Shawna Forde his \"director of border operations\" in February 2008 and she hosted his visit to Ellensburg. He assigned Shawna to lead a Minuteman Project unit down at an April border watch in Campo, California, led by Britt Craig, the Minuteman who, only a few years before, had defiantly declined to recognize Gilchrist as an organizational leader and had gotten into a tussle on the street with the local MMP leader.\n\nIt's unclear whether Shawna actually went down to Campo in April. She did, however, show up there in August. Craig's wife, Deborah, later explained in a statement: \"In August of 2008, Shawna Forde came [to] the border at Campo, CA and contacted Campo Minuteman Britt Craig. She did not make any comments to indicate she was unstable or violent. She had a Minutemen Civil Defense Corps badge so she presumably had been vetted by the group. Minutemen Civil Defense Corps charges a fee and does a background check.\"\n\nThe statement added that Forde and Britt Craig went to their operations center, dubbed Camp Vigilance, in separate vehicles, \"where she was given full access by the caretaker. She purchased a bulletproof vest from the caretaker and indicated she planned to spend the night. She indicated that she primarily did her border watching in AZ, that she had her own group, Minutemen American Defense, and we did not hear [from] her directly again.\"\n\nChris Simcox's MCDC organization in Tombstone also organized a border watch in Arizona that April, held at a private ranch about forty miles south of Three Points called King's Anvil Ranch, right in the middle of the Altar Valley. Lasting only a week, it was part of MCDC's announced strategy of holding more frequent border watches of shorter duration.\n\nThey held another \"muster\" at King's Anvil in mid-June. Reportedly, Shawna Forde showed up there, too, presenting herself as Gilchrist's MMP representative in the field. She was asked to leave, MCDC officials later claimed.\n\n\"They had a military, bad-ass posture about them,\" Chris Simcox later told a reporter. \"She had made a comment at that time that they were going to be stopping any drug dealers that they came into contact with. They were going to be carrying long arms and not be letting people pass.\"\n\nSimcox claimed that MCDC officials kicked Forde out of the camp and contacted the Border Patrol, whose agents \"went out and talked to them. And they B.S.'d them [the agents] as well,\" Simcox said.\n\nBut Shawna was evidently inspired by the Altar Valley ranch watch, because she then set about organizing her own watch in the Altar Valley that fall. This was to be a monthlong affair, headquartered at a desert-ranch RV park about eleven miles south of Three Points called Caballo Loco, which MCDC had also used as a camping facility for its musters.\n\nIn the meantime, with her daughter, Jaszmin, in tow, she returned to Glenn Spencer's ranch outside of Hereford in August and once again took up occupancy in the guest RV. By this time, however, he had gotten wind of Shawna's multiple sexual dalliances during her previous stay, and he asked her to leave after a little while. She asked if she could leave Jaszmin behind at the RV for a few weeks while she did more scouting work for her fall event. He refused and says he instructed his staff not to let her return.\n\nShawna instead returned to Everett and dumped Jaszmin with some friends. She showed up at the Caballo Loco the first week of October in her shiny new copper-colored Honda Element. She had paid $30,000 for it.\n\nShe arrived knowing her marriage with John Forde was finished, obliterated by this latest spate of border-watching travel and absence from their home. Before she left, he told her he was filing for divorce.\n\n\"Are you sure this is what you want?\" she had asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered. \"I want you out of my life. I want this madness to stop.\"\n\nIt was at the Caballo Loco that Shawna Forde won most of her media attention before the murders in Arivaca. Sebastien Wielemans was only one of several European documentarians to shoot footage of Minuteman American Defense's Delta One Operations (as Shawna had taken to calling them) in Arizona. Another crew from Norway also arrived and obtained similar shots of Shawna and her ragtag crew cruising the desert.\n\nShawna explained her philosophy to the filmmakers: \"We're not a Third World country. We're not getting people-scientists and doctors-here, OK? We're getting the poorest of the poor. We're getting Third World values into a first-rate country, which is dropping all of our rates way down.\n\n\"This is my country first. If you want to become an American, there's a process you need to go through, because a lot of people do go through that process. So it's important for us also to secure these borders. I think after 9/11, I think it made us realize what a target we are, and how many people out there want to see us dead. And I'm not sure what part of 'I want to kill you' we don't understand, but I understand it. And because I do understand that, I want to do my part in helping to get these borders secured and educate Americans on the issues of the southern border. And there's a lot of issues down here.\"\n\nThis was also where Chuck Stonex first met Shawna Forde and became part of her organization. You can see Stonex in some of the documentary footage, defending their presence in the desert and decrying illegal immigration.\n\nShawna posted a number of videos from her Altar Valley operations. The handheld clips often focus on the garbage left in the desert by border crossers. One notable video shows Forde claiming to have found a \"rape tree,\" a spot where the illicit coyotes would assault their female clients. The weirdest video, by far, features Shawna claiming that Border Patrol had found bodies of drug mules duped by terrorists into carrying radioactive materials hidden inside their marijuana loads. Forde explained that the smugglers' bodies couldn't be touched because \"the radiation is so heavy [it] will kill you on contact.\"\n\nA Boston-based photographer named Andrew Ong came out to try to document the Minutemen's activities. His shots-which later ran as a gallery at the online magazine Daily Beast-show Shawna stalking through the sand in high heels and tank tops.\n\nOng told Scott North that Forde spent the bulk of her time on the border laboring over emails or posts for the MAD website. Ong photographed Shawna's grand new tattoo: shoulder-to-shoulder ink across her back, the Minuteman American Defense logo-an eagle crest with the legend on its chest \"Rule Of Law\"-demonstrating her final allegiance.\n\nIn an eerily prescient scene, he also captured Shawna wading into a vacant desert home, gun in hand, wearing a dress and high heels, as she and her fellow Minutemen search for illegal immigrants. She was locked and loaded.\n\nOng tagged along on one of Shawna's night patrols, for which Shawna furnished some night-vision equipment. As the patrol stopped to check a brushy area for smugglers, Ong watched Shawna pick up a couple of rocks and heave them over the heads of her Minutemen.\n\nOne of the rocks hit a hard object, producing a sound like a ricocheting bullet. Sure enough, the Minutemen were convinced they were being shot at and scrambled for cover. Forde was back behind them, quietly laughing. She saw the look on Ong's face.\n\n\"Have some fun, Andrew,\" she said, grinning. \"Have some fun.\"\n\nThe next day, Forde ordered the Minutemen to report the incident to the Border Patrol, saying they had been shot at. She also posted a video of the incident on YouTube as evidence of the hazards Minutemen faced while patrolling the nation's borders.\n\nIndeed, Shawna and the Minutemen eagerly regaled the Norwegian film crew with the tale of their harrowing close call a few days later. Stonex, who was one of the Minutemen in the group, described the event from his clearly gullible perspective: \"We got ready to come out, and we spotted some fresh tracks, the driver seen some fresh tracks, and we got out and was investigating the fresh tracks, and probably got twenty-five, thirty yards down this little wash, and all of a sudden there was a gunshot and a ricochet that kind of fell between me and the cameraman. And we never did figure out who it was, but it was close. Some say it was a warning shot. I say it was a bad shot.\"\n\nIt was also an opportunity to tout their own bravery. \"I was out there with a flashlight,\" Stonex added. \"I mean, I was the prime target, I was the one that was fully armed. But that's the risks we take here on this border watch. Right now it's mostly drug cartels out here instead of people looking for a better way of life. It's just these guys trying to destroy somebody's better way of life.\"\n\nStonex said it had been awhile since he had been shot at. \"It was my first experience since I left Vietnam,\" he told the filmmakers. \"So you know, hey look-it's what price are you willing to pay to protect your country? Here you got a problem going on here. You got drugs coming over from Mexico and South America by the truckload. I'm willing to pay whatever price I have to protect my family and my country, you know.\"\n\nShawna made sure the journalists knew what stakes were at play: \"Shootings and deaths occur on a daily basis out here,\" she told them.\n\nThe whole scene left Andrew Ong shaking his head. \"It was very, very bizarre,\" he said. \"It was not at all what I expected.\"\n\nMuch of the reason Shawna got such an adrenaline rush from her life as a Minuteman was that it so closely approximated the kind of tough-guy action movies she loved to watch. She was out on the front lines, stalking the desert with a gun, making headlines, getting media attention. But up until the fall of 2008, all of her talk about investigating drug-cartel activity in the area had been mostly just that-talk.\n\nThen she finally had a breakthrough that October in Arivaca. She made a connection with a drug-cartel figure. They had a little macho showdown at the bar. They shared some cocaine. Then he showed her his stash house. She took pictures. It was all incredibly exhilarating.\n\nAt least, that was the picture she painted in a breathless email she sent to a handful of Minutemen, including Jim Gilchrist, on November 3. She described how she had descended into the murky underworld of drug smuggling in Arivaca, leaving her deeply fearful: \"Everyday I almost expect it to be my last. I have moved Jaszmin 'daughter' to a safe and undisclosed location,\" she explained.\n\nI met my contact in a Catina in Arivaca he had received a call I was in the area with a couple of others so he came to check me out, When this happened I order my guys around in front of him so he recognized that I was a leader \" it's a respect thing\" anyway I knew in my gut he was important but when we made eye contact it was confirmed he had eyes of a killer.\n\nI ordered my guys to leave me there so I could work it out. I wanted a knife so went to car with them and had them give me a knife which was a sorry excuse for one but I took it and put it into my bra, armed with a cell phone a lipstick and now a knife I went back in.\n\nWow as soon as they left it was on I was surrounded by the most dangerous looking group of drug cartel that you see in movies and it was not a flirt session it was \"Who are you, why are you in Arivaca? and they were hitting me hard and fast so I could see the leader sitting and watching me from the side to see how I would respond, I turned to one on my left told him to back off my grill and to go sit the fuck down because he was annoying me.\n\nI seen the leader nod and then he started to laugh and came and sat by me next thing I know I'm in a conversation with him and we had the whole side of the bar to ourselves they all went elsewhere just from a nod. He was testing me so he asked if I wanted to get high I said sure, This is not a place or time to be holier then thou. So we got up went outside in the courtyard and I followed him to the bathroom on our way down my knife fell out of my bra he saw it fall I quickly recovered it and said ohh \"my lipstick\" I did not think he was paying that close attention.\n\nwe get in the bathroom and he takes out his 45 slides it back to cock it and looks me dead in the eye. If I could share with you the feeling in that 8x10 room \"chilling\" then I looked him straight in the eye and say nice gun. He puts it down on the sink we laugh \"nervous laugh\"\n\nAt that point, as Shawna described it, they went back to the bar, and then after a nighttime walk about the town, he took her to his \"stash house.\" At one point, she claimed, he asked to see her knife and laughed at what she produced, then gave her a better-quality switch blade of his own. \"So we connected and were relaxed,\" she reported. \"I am planning on going back today sometime and hang I need to get his address and more pics.\"\n\nShawna attached the photos from the stash house with the email, which was titled: \"Stash house Do not share these!!!!!!!!! it would be my life.\" Naturally, this meant that it was immediately distributed widely among the Minutemen, both in Washington state and elsewhere. As with many of Shawna's emails, it caused a brief sensation in those circles.\n\nIt later emerged, of course, that the \"cartel guy\" with whom she had shared cocaine was none other than Albert Gaxiola. For some reason, she thought he was honcho of some sort, while in reality he was about a third-tier gofer, in charge of other gofers. But she didn't need to know that. He was going to be her connection in Arivaca. If he played his cards right, she was going to be very useful.\n\nShawna was not able to hang out in Arizona for very long after her big breakthrough, however. There was a little problem with money: she didn't have any. There was also the problem of the impending divorce from John Forde. The two were closely related.\n\nJohn knew the divorce was the right thing when all of his family members-including his children, who despised Shawna-started reconnecting with him, now that Shawna was out of the picture. \"The people in my family were like, 'Oh, thank god. Thank God,'\" he says.\n\nIn order to make the divorce possible, John had to take out a second mortgage on their properties. He learned in the course of doing so that Shawna, who always had cash on hand, was living on credit. She'd bought the Element entirely on a line of credit and had not made any payments on it.\n\nHe also discovered that Shawna had just been stuffing all of her bills into a shoe box. So he took them all, created a spreadsheet, got a high-interest loan, and paid them all off, including her jewelry bills; he even got her current on her car payments. So when Shawna returned to Everett in early December, she had her economic house largely in order, thanks to John.\n\nEven so, she kept after him. \"She kept wanting more money,\" John recalls. \"I said, 'Listen, I'm not going to give you more money.'\"\n\nIn the meantime, Shawna had found a new boyfriend. His name was Thomas Wayne Gibler, a slender, six-foot man with tattoos and a rap sheet longer than Shawna's. Gibler in fact had fourteen felony convictions to his name, including a panoply of assault and drug charges as well as a high-speed police chase. The state had designated him a high-risk violent offender and placed him under active supervision. Apparently, he was just what Shawna was looking for; she introduced him to several people in Snohomish County as her boyfriend.\n\nJohn, however, had not met him. At least not yet.\n\nThe divorce was being handled by a legal outfit called Peaceful Separations in Everett. One day, Shawna came in to sign some papers in the divorce and wound up chatting up the paralegal handling the papers. \"She asked the woman, 'What would happen if John died, or something happened?'\"\n\nIn fact, Washington is what is known as a \"community property\" state-that is, a spouse is entitled to all of a decedent's property if that person dies intestate, without a will. As it happened, John was worth close to a half-million dollars at the time. If that fell to Shawna, it would be her biggest haul ever: \"She would have got the most money had I died compared to anything she has done-big time,\" John says.\n\nThe paralegal thought that Shawna's query was odd and brought in the lawyer because of it. The attorneys in turn gave John a heads up that Shawna was floating those kinds of questions and advised him to keep trickling money to her so that he could get out of the situation as quickly and cleanly as possible. So he did-not large sums, but enough, he thought, to keep her at bay.\n\nJohn felt liberated too. It was December, Christmas was approaching, and he was enjoying life for the first time in awhile, going skiing and hanging out with his old friends. Some of them started telling him stories about Shawna, stories they had kept quiet about out of respect for John's marriage. Now that it was over, they were telling him the truth. The more he heard, the more relieved he was to be done with her.\n\nIt had mostly been amicable. The only bump in the proceedings came when John rekeyed the locks to their duplex. Shawna complained bitterly to him, calling from what she said was an attorney's office and insisting that she had a right to be in the home until the divorce was final. She threatened to bring cops if he didn't give her a key. He caved and gave her a key to the back door.\n\nOther than that, the proceedings were going smoothly-almost too smoothly for anything involving Shawna. \"My buddies even said, 'John, something is going on. It is too easy,'\" John recalls.\n\nOn the afternoon of December 22, he got what he thought was a strange call from Shawna. \"She asked if I was going to be home,\" he recalls. \"She was going to pick up some of her stuff.\" She asked him when he was going to be home, something she'd never done before.\n\nThe whole situation felt ominous to John. He had felt twinges of fear and found himself looking out his window irregularly. What he suspected was that if Shawna wanted to hurt him, she would trash one of his Porsche Boxsters, in which he took a great deal of pride.\n\nJohn knocked off work at five p.m. as usual and went home to their duplex. He was still in his work clothes, sitting on the couch, watching the evening news with Charlie, his Jack Russell terrier, snuggled next to him, when the stranger walked in.\n\nThe living room and kitchen were on the second floor of the duplex, so the man-a thin Caucasian of average height, mustachioed, his hands in his pockets-had entered from below, through the back door. At first, having heard nothing until the man suddenly appeared from the stairwell, John thought it was simply someone who had come in the wrong door and into the wrong home.\n\nThen the shooting began. \"He came around the corner, and within seconds he pulled out his right hand and started shooting,\" John recalls. \"It was one second, maybe two. I was ready to say something, and he started to shoot.\"\n\nBeing shot, John says, is not the way it is in the movies. When you're hit by a bullet, he says, you're done; your body gives out, and you can't move. \"You are down for the fucking count, let me tell you,\" he says. And you observe the strangest things.\n\nJohn was looking at the man's clothing. It was cheap clothing but brand new: a tan windbreaker, tan pants, tan ball cap. \"It looked as if he'd picked it all up at JCPenney or Sears in the work-clothes section,\" John recalls. \"The first thing I thought was Shawna got him an outfit to kill me at Sears. She had a card.\"\n\nThe man did not handle the gun professionally, either: he fired from a crooked arm at his waist, like they do in old noir films. That may be why John survived.\n\nThe first shot hit his left arm, then the next shot hit his right arm. One of those rounds passed through the arm and pierced his lungs. The man fired three more rounds into John's torso, with one hitting his lower right abdomen, another hitting his liver and diaphragm, and one more round lodged in his back. Thinking he was done, the man turned and fled back down the stairs.\n\nJohn lay there, stunned, helpless, smelling his own flesh smoldering where the bullets had entered, knowing he was now bleeding, profusely, to death. At first all he could do was wonder: \"All I could think of was 'What did I do? What did I do?'\" But as he realized who the only person who might want him dead might be, he turned angry, and that probably saved him.\n\nJohn had a lifelong dread of being shot. \"I know what bullets do to you. You don't die right away. That's the horror in my mind of being shot. You know you are going to die.\" Lying on the couch, he realized: \"My worst nightmare has come true.\"\n\nAt first he tried making noise to attract his neighbors' attention, but when there was no response, he realized he could reach the phone, since he had not been shot in either leg. He half-walked, half-crawled to where the phone was and, using the remnants of his bloodied hands, dialed 911.\n\nHe was intent on letting them know right away that he knew Shawna was behind it all. \"I just started screaming my name, my address, her name, her address. I'm shot. I'm hit I'm dying. Get somebody here.\"\n\n\"I said her name a hundred times: 'I'm getting a divorce. She's trying to kill me. Nobody would do this to me. Shawna Forde is trying to kill me.' \"\n\nHe doesn't remember how long it took for the ambulance to arrive, but it seemed to take forever, especially because they tried entering through his front door and had to jigger the gurney around on his stairs; he recalls that on the way out, they nearly dropped him over the side of the exterior stairs. He finally lost consciousness en route to the hospital and thought he was dying as he did so. He was in excruciating pain and barely able to breathe, and as blackness closed in, he thought he saw the white light so many people with near-death experiences describe.\n\nDoctors went to work immediately, even though they did not give him much of a chance: he had lost too much blood, had suffered too many egregious injuries. Still, John was alive the next morning, and the next, and the next. He remembers none of it, though.\n\nShawna in fact was taken into custody that evening and questioned about the shooting. She denied having anything to do with it and suggested that it was likely the work of drug cartels in Arizona that she had angered. She was released that night and told to stay in town.\n\nShe wasted no time. The next day, she and Tommy Gibler moved into the duplex, ignoring the crime-scene tape. She had John's wallet and credit cards and promptly began using them. She never went up to John's hospital room to visit him or check on him.\n\nIt wasn't until four days after the shooting, the day after Christmas, that John's family learned he had been shot and was in critical condition in the hospital. Shawna hadn't bothered to contact them. They only found out because one of John's commuting buddies had pieced everything together and tracked him down to the hospital. The buddy had then contacted Shawna to get John's computer and cell phone back, but Shawna wouldn't let him have the latter. Still, he was able to get the phone numbers for John's family, and he called them to let them know. They all came to the hospital within the hour, found that John had been registered under a wrong name, and bulled their way up to see him.\n\nJohn was in a medically induced coma at the time. All he remembers is being on a long spiritual journey and seeing the world from a removed state, and then realizing he was still alive and wanted to live. A short time later he woke up.\n\nThe doctors who had worked on him were amazed, and they came by frequently to tell him how lucky he was. \"You are a miracle,\" they told him. \"It is just a miracle you are alive.\"\n\nIndeed: John was out of the hospital in twelve days. He retreated to a safe place out of town and began piecing things back together, while Shawna and Tommy Gibler helped themselves to his old residence. While he was recovering, he discovered that Shawna had forged his name on a check for $3,000 from his credit union and had freely used his debit and credit cards and rung up several thousand dollars' worth there. He also figured out that, prior to her most recent Arizona sojourn, she had obtained a $9,000 loan on their joint account without his knowledge, also using a forged version of his signature.\n\nJohn had long since stopped being amazed at Shawna's audacity. Indeed, she had already moved on to what she liked to call \"the next level.\"\n\nAfter her initial interview with Everett detectives about the murder attempt on John Forde, Shawna began assiduously avoiding any kind of follow-up interview, finding one excuse after another to put police off. \"We've made several attempts to schedule a meeting with Ms. Forde. We've not been successful,\" an Everett police spokesman told Scott North two months later.\n\nExactly a week after John was shot, Shawna called Everett police from the duplex and claimed she had been beaten and raped. Officers arrived to find her on the kitchen floor, her knees to her chest, sobbing and moaning and saying she had been raped. There was a little blood on the shower curtain, but police could find few signs of injuries.\n\nShawna was so groggy-seeming that they wondered if she was on drugs; her eyelids were fluttering, and she appeared to be slipping in and out of consciousness. They loaded her onto a gurney. But just as she was being wheeled out the door, she ordered the crews to stop for a minute. She needed her purse.\n\nOne of the investigating officers noticed that cuts on Forde's forearms and thighs-which she later told investigators were wounds from the knife her attackers used-were in fact oddly superficial and shallow, consistent with the injuries seen when people deliberately hurt themselves. Police call these \"hesitation wounds.\" They had in fact already scabbed over and appeared to be at least a day old.\n\nThe next day, even though she had not yet given a statement to police about her rape, Shawna got on the phone and called Scott North at the Herald, asking if he was going to report on her rape in the Everett paper. \"I was assaulted. I was raped. I was beaten. I was cut with a knife,\" she told him. She knew the rape kit would come back negative, as it eventually did, but that it would be several weeks before anyone would find that out.\n\nNorth made a few phone calls and figured out that there was a deeper problem with Shawna. He is a veteran newsman and had spent at least a portion of his time as a reporter in the 1990s dealing with the outbreak of right-wing extremists-militiamen, tax protesters, and \"constitutionalists\"-who had beset portions of Snohomish County and western Washington generally, so he was aware of their proclivities. Moreover, his news sense, honed by thirty years of experience, told him that there might be a real story there-just not necessarily the one Shawna Forde wanted to tell everyone.\n\nShawna's version, of course, had in short order been blasted out on the MAD website. She posted it the day after she called North, giving her own harrowing account of her vile mistreatment at the hands of likely Latino gang members. It included photos she had taken supposedly showing her bruises, though even an untrained eye could see that these looked suspiciously like makeup jobs.\n\nThe Herald ran a story the next day. Jim Gilchrist's Minuteman Project website picked up and promoted Shawna's version of the story, as did the right-wing blogosphere, which began recounting her tale unquestioningly. (At Sound Politics, the leading right-wing political blog for Washington state politicos, the contributor \"pudge\"-who had posted Shawna's account uncritically-scathingly attacked anyone who questioned her story, or worse yet, suggested she might have had a hand in John's shooting.) A conservative webcast called No Compromise Radio conducted an interview with Shawna in which she described three or four assailants shooting her husband and then a like number coming back to beat and rape her.\n\nShawna had by then gained a large number of enemies among the ranks of Minutemen and other nativists-most notably, Jeff Schwilk of the San Diego Minutemen as well as William Gheen of American Legal Immigration PAC-who castigated Gilchrist for his gullibility. \"Jim!\" shouted one Schwilk missive. \"Don't be a moron!\"\n\nShawna was dismayed that anyone could suggest she had anything to do with John's shooting or that she had faked her rape, calling such notions \"ridiculous.\" She had her defenders, too, including Chuck Stonex, who told the Herald: \"It happened. Absolutely. I have no doubt in my mind that it happened.\"\n\nJim Gilchrist defended her just as vociferously. He told her critics (and his) that what mattered more was her ability to overcome a troubled past. \"She is no whiner,\" he wrote. \"She is a stoic struggler who has chosen to put country, community and a yearning for a civilized society ahead of avarice and self-glorifying ego.\"\n\nWhen detectives finally spoke to her on January 13, Shawna told them she had been feeding snacks to Charlie, John's dog, when a Hispanic man appeared out of nowhere and punched her on the left side of her face, near her eye. \"I just went down immediately,\" she told them. \"Bam! I just remember hitting the, I mean, and then everything was like really dizzy, just starry, you know, like I was seeing stars you know, like they say you see stars? Well, you do.\"\n\nThere were two, maybe three attackers, she said. One of them had on a black ski mask, but she could tell he was Hispanic. The second was a young white male with a scraggly beard and mustache, who used a knife to threaten and subdue her. They were speaking both English and Spanish, saying things like \"chinga la puta\" and \"let's drown the bitch.\" They then proceeded to rape her anally and vaginally, she said, using a miniature souvenir baseball bat. The attack lasted about fifteen or twenty minutes.\n\nInvestigators asked if she knew her attackers. \"No,\" she replied. \"But I do remember hearing like some 'weezie' or 'weasel' or something. ... So, I don't know what this is about.\"\n\nSomeone had written the number thirteen on her kitchen floor in black magic marker. The police asked her why they might have done that.\n\n\"I think that somebody did that just to be a jerk,\" she told them. \"And just maybe to scare me or to make me think it was something else. ... I didn't really make a lot of it to be honest...\"\n\n\"So even now you're not making a big deal out of that?\"\n\n\"No, because after, If you really think about it, and after I've thought about it and talked to people-if it was, I mean there are MS-13 in north Everett, I mean they're out, they are there ...\"\n\n\"But had you had anything to do with them?\"\n\n\"Well, other than going after their cartel operations, no. But you know, I'm not one of their friendliest people. They don't like me, I mean; you know I'm not probably on their top list of favorites.\"\n\n\"Aren't you more concerned with illegals crossing the border; just to come over here to work?\"\n\n\"No. I'm more concerned about the drug cartels.\"\n\nTwo days later, on January 15, Shawna's mother, Rena Caudle, got a strange call at her California home from her daughter. \"She called me that evening, and she says, 'There's somebody following me in a white car,'\" Rena recalls. \"And she says, 'I'm going to duck into this alley here and see if I lost them. And I'll call you back later.'\" Then she hung up.\n\nA little while later, Kathy Dameron got a similar call in Yakima from Shawna in Everett. She said she was walking back from the Eagles lodge, and they started shooting the breeze. The only thing that was odd was that Shawna kept telling her where she was at the moment.\n\nSuddenly, it got tense. \"Oh my God, there is a car following me,\" Shawna told Kathy. Then she said there were two cars-one light, one dark. Shawna said she was ducking into an alleyway and then said she thought she had lost them. Then Shawna cried out: \"Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh shit!\"\n\nKathy Dameron hung up and called the Everett police directly and told them what she had heard and Shawna's location. She called Shawna back immediately.\n\nShawna answered and told Kathy she had been shot in the arm. \"The cops are on the way,\" she told Kathy.\n\nKathy recalls, \"She said one shot had gone past her head; that she was turned sideways, and two went into her arm.\"\n\nPolice arrived and took Shawna to the hospital and gathered witness statements. Nobody had seen the shooting, but some of the neighbors had heard gunfire and had come out to investigate.\n\nJim Gilchrist expressed his surprise at the spate of violence directed at Shawna. \"I don't think this is a hoax. I don't know what to think,\" he said. \"I'm certainly in shock. We have to let law enforcement play it out and see what is going on.\"\n\nThe shooting was the final straw for her brother, Merrill Metzger, who knew that Jaszmin was living with Shawna at the time. He drove up with his son from California the next day to retrieve his niece and bring her down to the family in California, so she could be safer.\n\nShawna had told him that Scott North had written a story about the attempt on John's life that included a police sketch of the gunman, taken from John's description. When he arrived in Everett and they had settled in on the couch at Shawna's place, where she was hanging out with Tommy Gibler, he got curious.\n\n\"So I asked her for that article, and we were both, my son and I, sitting there looking at the drawing,\" Merrill recalls. \"And I looked up, and all of a sudden Shawna looks at me and she said, 'That drawing kind of looks like you.'\n\n\"And I said, 'No, not really.' We were laughing.\n\n\"And I said, 'Actually, it looks like him'\"-he pointed to Gibler-\"the guy that was there with her. Immediately the laughing was over.\"\n\nThey flew home the next day. \"When I got out of Everett, and I was back home with my niece, I called the Everett Police Department, and I told them, 'Hey, that guy that's with Shawna right now fits that description of the shooter to a T.'\"\n\nEverett police, however, have never made an arrest in the attempted murder of John Forde. Even though John eventually made a positive identification to police, and neighbors who saw the gunman climb over John's back fence that night have done so as well, a police department spokesman insists that-short of finding the gun used and the clothes worn-there is not enough physical evidence to bring a case to court.\n\nOn February 5, Shawna Forde came in to the offices of the Herald for a two-hour interview. Scott North had conducted a thorough investigation of her the previous two months and had uncovered all the secrets of her past: her felony conviction at age eleven, her career as a prostitute and petty criminal, her many lies and deceptions.\n\nThe interview was conducted in a special room and was video recorded. What's most remarkable, watching those videos now, is how utterly unflappable Shawna was as North laid out before her the devastating results of his investigation. And at the end, she just smiled confidently and said, \"It's not about the past. It's about what we do today, and trying to secure the borders tomorrow.\"\n\nThe story ran on February 22 on the front page of the Sunday paper. Shortly thereafter, Shawna-who never did give police that follow-up interview for detectives about John's shooting-took off for Arizona again, and this time she did not come back.\n\nExcerpted with permission from \" And Hell Followed with Her: Crossing the Dark Side of the American Border \" by David Neiwert.

      "text": "DEI exposes the myth of white male superiority - and that's why they hate it\n\nA protester holds a sign saying \"Trump wins\" at a rally in support of U.S. President Donald Trump at the Oregon State Capitol in Salem, Oregon, U.S. January 6, 2021.\n\nTrump and his white male supremacist buddies in government and rightwing media have been playing our legacy media and the American people for suckers. And it's working.\n\n\" Big Balls \" and his openly racist buddies at DOGE have been, according to reports in the media, scouring federal agencies for \" illegal DEI \" programs. Meanwhile, rightwing radio hosts are speculating whether the Delta Airlines crash in Toronto this week was the result of a female or Black \"DEI hire\" pilot flying the plane because Delta has refused to kill off its own DEI programs.\n\nThe explicit and implicit message Trump, Musk, and their goon squad have been promoting is that when a woman or Black, disabled, or Hispanic man is hired they are inherently inferior in their intellect and capabilities to the white man from whom that job was taken.\n\nIt's an evil lie.\n\nAnd every time it gets promoted by Trump, Musk, or the media every woman or Black pilot, manager, doctor, or any other position historically filled by white men can feel white people looking at them and wondering if they're an \"inferior\" person hired just because of their gender or the color of their skin.\n\nHow'd we get here?\n\nFor most of my lifetime, white men have enjoyed a \"Mad Men\" privileged status when it comes to employment. Part of it was because - after centuries of legal discrimination - Blacks and women were less likely to own businesses or be in management positions to hire staff.\n\nIt's a natural human instinct to want to surround oneself with people who're consider simpatico; people who look, think, and talk like you do. Thus, white men doing hiring had a built-in bias (sometimes unconscious) to hire other white men. Similarly, many hiring choices are made without even posting job offers because the person doing the hiring \"knows someone\" who'd be able to do the job.\n\nThere's also the reality of conscious and unconscious bias that tends to keep mostly male and white workplaces that way, and the result of that is that most white Americans' default assumption is that white people are generally the most competent. After all, look at all those white people who have all those great jobs!\n\nStepping into this reality, people of good conscience have spent the past half-century trying to work out ways to break up the \"old white boy network\" of hiring and promotions, to allow highly qualified women and Black men (among others) to have equal, merit-based job opportunities.\n\nStarting as the Civil Rights movement, followed by the 1980s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programs, a clear effort to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace took form in the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nIt was never meant to elevate incompetent women and Black people into positions above their ability; instead, it was designed to prevent incompetent white men from getting jobs for which there are more competent women or Black people.\n\nIn other words, by definition \"DEI hires\" are the most qualified people available, regardless of their race or gender. DEI programs are almost universally meritocratic; their goal is to simply open the hiring door to a wider variety of people beyond just white men.\n\nBut you won't hear that from openly racist rightwing media and Republican politicians; they're committed to convincing white men that their jobs suck because women and Black people took the \"good jobs,\" rather than that 45 years of Reaganism/neoliberalism gutted America's manufacturing base and destroyed our unions.\n\nThus, when Musk and Trump and their people talk about DEI, what they're really saying is that women and Black people (among others) are simply inferior to white men, and a giant conspiracy/system - DEI - is handing these inferior people jobs that rightfully belong to white men.\n\nProbably the most disgusting part of this entire charade is how the media goes along with Republicans in this racist, misogynist framing of the issue.\n\nFor example, have you ever heard a media commentator, when discussing DEI and the Trump/Musk apartheid war against it, point out that DEI generally guarantees the most qualified people get the job? Have you ever heard them explain that DEI is really just about opening the pool of job candidates to a wider cross-section of Americans?\n\nI haven't.\n\nI hear them discuss DEI and \"DEI hires\" as if Trump was right when he knew a woman had piloted the helicopter that crashed into a plane over the Potomac and then blamed it on DEI. As if that woman must be less qualified than the white man who wasn't piloting the chopper.\n\nAnd that's a racist, sexist lie. Why can't the media just say that?\n\nThere's no more vivid example of white people and men getting hiring preferences over more highly qualified women or minorities than Trump's cabinet nominees: case in point Pete Hegseth.\n\nOur Secretary of Defense lost no time at stopping the military from recruiting at girls' schools and the Black Engineer of the Year Awards: he only wants white men as incompetent, alcoholic, and into womanizing as himself in his White Men's Military.\n\nThe reality is that Trump and Musk are all about DEI hires, using their twisted definition of the term. Musk's team appears to be entirely white and male, as are most of the people Trump surrounds himself with. One could argue, in that context, that DEI stands for \"Don, Eric, and Ivanka.\"\n\nLet's just tell the truth. Trump's anti-DEI policy is about white and male supremacy. Trump's immigration deportation policy is about white supremacy. And Trump's assertion that he knows \"what the law is\" and is above the law is about white billionaire supremacy.\n\nAs Delta Airlines knows, DEI hiring - by opening wider the gates through which job applicants can come - insures the best and the brightest become Delta pilots, flight attendants, engineers, etc.\n\nRepublicans and rightwing media will complain all day long that air crashes and every other problem are caused by women and Black people being hired into jobs that were historically filled by white men.\n\nBut it's always been a racist, sexist lie and still is today. And the media should have the courage to say so.\n\nPass it on.\n\nNow Read: Experiencing rage and fear? This is for you."

      "text": "Here's the ugly truth behind Miami's supposedly 'progressive' style of criminal justice\n\nT he National District Attorneys Association is the main professional body for American prosecutors, and like the Fraternal Order of Police, it is retrograde when it comes to justice. The organization has fear-mongered about youth use of marijuana skyrocketing in states that have legalized the substance, while pushing for heightened federal crackdowns . The NDAA also aggressively fought a White House report that sharply criticized the use of bogus forensic evidence in criminal courts.\n\nIn short, the NDAA is not a particularly meritorious organization, and amplifies entrenched ways of law enforcement thinking. One of its vehicles for doing so is its magazine, aptly titled The Prosecutor . Generally speaking, to read it, one must be a member of the organization, and membership is only open to \"those working in the prosecution field, as well as individuals seeking justice for communities and working on behalf of victims.\"\n\nBut thanks to someone posting it online, the general public gets to see Miami-Dade County State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle, one of the most conservative top prosecutors under the Democratic Party banner, prop herself up as a progressive.\n\nIn a new 16-page article , Rundle explains her approach, which she dubs \"Miami-Style Smart Justice.\" In the written equivalent of a side-eye, Rundle writes, \"While more and more district attorneys have begun to experiment with what some call 'progressive' solutions, strategic remedial measures that reduce crime, improve lives, and save money are a matter of tradition in Miami-Dade County.\"\n\nThat is certainly one way to put it.\n\nThe average person won't know the history of Rundle's tenure, but it's well worth exploring as an illustration of the glaring gap between a quasi-reformist prosecutor's rhetoric and the realities on the ground. (And while this is about Rundle, it could just as easily be about the district attorneys of places like Brooklyn, Manhattan, and other liberal urban jurisdictions not impacted by the Soros-funded wave of progressive DAs.)\n\nIn her article, Rundle sets herself aside from what she deems the \"Traditional Approach\" of US criminal justice: essentially, lock 'em all up. That may be truer now than it was in the past. Prison admissions have indeed gone down in Miami-Dade County over the years, thanks in part due to changes Rundle has made  In FY 2000-2001 , Miami-Dade County accounted for 9.1 percent of the state's annual prison admissions, but by FY 2015-2016 , it accounted for only 6.8 percent⁠-beaten out by both Hillsborough and Broward Counties. Perhaps a change of heart came sometime after 2007, when Rundle still bragged on her government website about ratcheting up the harshness of punishments, using the same criminal code that she herself helped draft.\n\nRundle has also consulted with some criminal justice reform groups on ways to enact incrementalist reforms in recent years. The Justice Collaborative, the successor organization to a Harvard project that excoriated Rundle's record on the death penalty in 2016, helped her create a modernized bail policy, by which people facing some nonviolent misdemeanor charges-including prostitution and \"driving with license suspended for failure to pay or appear\"-are recommended for release from pretrial jailing without payment. The extent of impact is unclear, though Rundle has started taking donations from the bail bonds industry this campaign cycle.\n\nIt is also worth acknowledging that whatever good came out of the new bail policy would likely be negated by a new $393 million \"megajail\" the mayor and county commission are looking to build. Reflecting her comfort with mass incarceration, Rundle has not expressed her opposition to the plan. In contrast, Rundle's 2020 challenger, Melba Pearson, has .\n\nLike other quasi-progressives, Rundle implemented many \"reforms\" that broadened the criminal justice system's iron grip on vulnerable, non-dangerous people's lives. Rundle is a major supporter of the county's drug court, which was the first in the nation . While drug courts are better than prosecutors simply trying to send all people who use drugs into jails and prisons, they are only marginally so. Compliance is highly difficult. The courts criminalize relapse , even though returning to drug use is part of many people's path to recovery from addiction.\n\nIn Delaware County, Pennsylvania, more people died of overdose in 2017 alone than succeeded in the drug court from 2008 to 2018.\n\nActually treating drug use as a public health issue means removing the matter from the criminal justice system entirely, so health professionals, and not lawyers and judges , can make the right diagnostic calls. Rundle does not get this, or she chooses not to get it, privileging a rigid and simplistic criminological analysis over the ethical practice of medicine.\n\nIn her article, Rundle justifies her approach by pointing to recidivism statistics⁠-68 percent of released prisoners are rearrested at least once within the first three years after release, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics . Rundle then conflates drug and alcohol use with crime by mistaking correlation with causation, remarking that one study found that \"over 84% of state prisoners were alcohol or drug involved\"- whatever that means. This is a widely believed point of view amongst American law enforcement, but not one that a supposedly progressive prosecutor should parrot.\n\nRundle cannot honestly rest her hat on her fidelity to victims' rights, either. Twelve years into her tenure as State Attorney, Rundle's office had no specialized sex crimes unit . Rundle still does not seem to have one today, though she has one for domestic violence. For decades, Rundle had done next to nothing to mitigate the non-testing of over 10,000 rape kits. She waited for other governmental actors to push the issue, unlike some of her peers in other big, liberal cities.\n\nRundle also virtually never prosecutes police shootings of unarmed civilians. Having worked on many prosecutor campaigns across the country, I can say that this decision often has most to do with political cowardice. The police, the hardest law enforcement sector to change, explode at DAs who charge errant cops, and channel their anger into political retaliation. Regardless of personal motives that might include self-preservation, prosecutors like Rundle nuke the criminal justice system's legitimacy every time they fail to charge an appropriate case. That is doubly true in communities of color, where people are much more likely to be killed by cops.\n\nFrom a human rights standpoint, earlier parts of Rundle's tenure were nothing short of heinous. Rundle charged kids as young as 13 as adults; one of her long-term deputies once seriously considered a murder charge against a 5-year-old. From 2006 to 2015, Miami-Dade County had handed down 13 juvenile life sentences without parole-two more than Harris County, Texas (Houston), despite Harris County having almost double Miami-Dade's population.\n\nRundle's administration also obtained more death sentences from 2010 to 2015 than 99 percent of district attorneys across the country, with some tossed out for deliberate, purposeless prosecutorial misconduct . Her own assistant prosecutor, Abraham Laeser, broke national records by obtaining over 30 death sentences himself (many of which were sought after he got caught unzipping his fly in front of a defense attorney and a female jury consultant).\n\nToday, Rundle holds the state of Florida back on big policy debates. As the longest-serving registered Democrat in the highly influential Florida Prosecuting Attorneys Association , she has major sway over how other Florida state attorneys perceive bold reforms (like no longer seeking the death penalty) from progressive prosecutors like Orlando State Attorney Aramis Ayala. Instead of sticking up for Ayala, Rundle chose to denounce Ayala along with the rest of the State Attorneys. Elsewhere, Rundle has defended ugly practices like Florida's direct-filing of kids to adult court via prosecutorial whim, which helps make her state the nation's cruelest on juvenile justice.\n\nThis is not to say that Rundle does not still make awful calls in her main role as prosecutor. Darren Rainey's death immediately comes to mind. Rainey was a middle-aged Black man suffering from schizophrenia, serving two years in a Miami prison for cocaine possession. When three guards threw him into a scalding hot shower, his skin sloughed off and he was effectively boiled alive . To Rundle, this constituted no crime, and she refused to charge them.\n\nIn her NDAA article, Rundle claims to be ahead of the curve on treating people with mental illness with dignity in the criminal justice system. But her handling of Rainey's case led to Rundle's political party calling for her resignation . And after Rundle traveled to New York City to be on a mental health-focused panel at John Jay College's national \"Smart on Crime\" conference, Ed Chung at the Center of American Progress personally apologized for Rundle's attendance on Twitter .\n\nHer poor discretion is not limited to one standout case. In 2015, Rundle sought a charge with a three-year mandatory prison sentence for marijuana. This was not a giant retailer of the plant, either. The defendant, a Black Hispanic man named Ricardo Varona who grew 15 marijuana plants in his home, argued that he did so to help his cancer-stricken wife with pain .\n\nVarona's race matters because the ACLU of Florida recently reported on the extreme racial bias found in Rundle's administration of \"justice.\" Black neighborhoods in her area face higher arrest rates. The charges at arrest, which police set in Florida, are harsher for Black people, who also face the most drug charges. But the inequality is not limited to the cops. Rundle's office gets to decide whether to change the charge set by police.\n\nUltimately, the ACLU unveiled that \"Black Hispanic defendants are convicted at a rate that is over five and half times higher than their share of the county population.\" In addition, \"Black Hispanic defendants serve jail or prison sentences at a rate over six times greater than their share of the county population,\" and Black people who do not identify as Hispanic get the harshest sentences in Miami-Dade on average.\n\nKatherine Fernandez Rundle neglects to address the egregious ways she stands on an island all her own compared with prosecutors in other big, liberal cities. The fact that some criminal justice reform organizations cooperate with her in a limited capacity is not a signal that she is \"progressive,\" but more a recognition that cooperation is for the greater good of a jurisdiction with approximately three million residents.\n\nGiven Rundle's electoral popularity, it is a shame that Miami-Dade may not soon see the sweeping change a true progressive prosecutor candidate, like Philadelphia DA Larry Krasner, can bring.\n\nOn the bright side, Miami's elected prosecutor turns 70 this year, meaning that a change in guard in the somewhat-near future is inevitable. Time is running out for Rundle to demonstrate that her self-rebranding exercise in The Prosecutor contains the merest shred of truth.\n\nThis article was originally published by Filter , a magazine covering drug use, drug policy and human rights.

      "text": "10 Hate Crimes Inspired by Donald Trump's Hateful Rhetoric\n\nIt strikes me as vaguely ironic that Trump supporters, who so badly want to want to Make America Great Again, are relying on the old standbys of this country's recipe for success: racism and violence. Genocide, slavery, Jim Crow and state-sanctioned terrorism against black folks are all a part of what Trump's base considers the best of times-before subtle, sophisticated racism and political correctness came along and ruined white people's good times. And so Trump, a man who fully embraces violence in his personal life , publicly embraces violence for America as well, more outspokenly than any candidate in recent history. His supporters, a fervent bunch, follow suit.\n\nMembership in white supremacist and anti-government groups has steadily climbed. A study by the SPLC found that Trump's rhetoric is creating an \"alarming level of fear and anxiety among children of color\" while emboldening some white students, and is directly tied to \"an increase in bullying, harassment and intimidation of students whose races, religions or nationalities have been... verbal targets.\" Just days ago, a Trump fan posted a video urging compatriots to shoot black women and children. Trump supporters have sent death threats to Jewish reporters on social media. Hate crimes against Muslims are rising precipitously , and now stand at levels higher than just after 9/11.\n\nThere is plenty of violence at Trump rallies against people of color, but that violence spills beyond the rooms where Trump riles his crowds and bleeds into Muslim, African-American and Hispanic lives. This list is a roundup of 10 examples. But please know that not every perpetrator speaks Trump's name aloud, not every hate crime is reported and not every report makes the news. So this is likely just a small fraction of what's happening.\n\n1. Two Boston Trump supporters viciously beat Hispanic man.\n\nRoughly a year ago, Boston brothers Scott and Steve Leader were arrested for brutally attacking a homeless Hispanic man, beating him with a metal pipe, urinating on him and shouting \" anti-immigrant \" statements as they carried out the attack. Arresting officers said the two brothers cited Trump as their inspiration, saying , \"Donald Trump was right. All these illegals need to be deported.\"\n\nTrump's response to learning about the attack? Calling it \"a shame,\" but in the same breath, stating, \"I will say, the people that are following me are very passionate. They love this country, they want this country to be great again.\"\n\n2. Muslim and Hispanic college students attacked in Kansas.\n\nWichita State University study body president Khondoker Usama, a 23-year-old Muslim student from Bangladesh, and a Hispanic friend stopped at a local Kwik Shop late on a Friday in March. In an interview with the Washington Post , Usama says he noticed a white motorcyclist verbally harassing a black man, \"calling him a lazy ass, saying, 'You guys don't work.' He was using racial slurs.\"\n\nHe says when the man took note of Usama and his friend, he began shouting, \"Hey, you brown trash, you better go home.\" Usama's friend insisted, \"It's my country. Who the hell are you to tell me, 'Go home?'\" That's when Usama alleges the violence began. (If you can bear the obnoxious voiceover-maybe just shut off your speakers-video of the incident is here .)\n\n\"He seemed to be looking for a fight,\" Usama told the Post. \"The man started punching my friend. My friend dodged the first punch. I got in the middle of them-I told my friend to get back in the car. [The man] pushed me and he hit me over.\" He began \"kicking [my friend] in the stomach, indiscriminately punching him.\"\n\nUsama called the cops and the motorcyclist took off, but not before endorsing Trump.\n\n\"He was chanting, 'Trump! Trump! Trump!'\" Usama told the Post. \"'Make America great again! You guys are the losers! You guys, we'll throw you over the wall!'\"\n\n\"You know, the usual things you see at a Trump rally.\"\n\n3. African-American woman verbally attacked on subway in New York City.\n\nDressed, perhaps, for a Panama Jack costume contest, an angry white man berated an African-American woman on the L train for-per the New York Daily News -taking the last available seat. (At least he accurately understood Trump's real campaign slogan: \"Make America Great Like it Was Before Rosa Parks Again.\")\n\nThe video shows the unhinged man getting very in the woman's face, and shouting racist and sexist insults: \"Worthless stupid fucking stupid cunt. Donald Trump 2016! Put them back in the fucking fields where they belong,\" he rants.\n\n\"Reveal exactly who you are,\" the woman responds, making her retort one of my new favorite things.\n\n4. Interracial couple stabbed in Washington.\n\nA black man and his white girlfriend were standing in front of an Olympia bar around 8:30 p.m. when a white male bearing a \"weird\" smile approached them, then brandished a knife and lunged at them while spouting racial slurs. In a statement, police said 32-year-old Daniel Rowe was \"unknown to the victims and the attack appears\" to be \"purely racial.\"\n\nDuring the arrest, Olympia police spokesperson Lt. Paul Lower says Rowe told officers, \"'Yeah, I stabbed them. I'm a white supremacist.' He begins talking about Donald Trump rallies and attacking people at the Black Lives Matter protest.\"\n\n5. Elderly African-American man and grandson threatened with knife in Ohio.\n\nIn June, 20-year-old Timothy Stewart was visiting his grandfather when a knife-wielding 54-year-old neighbor named Henry Slapnik allegedly made threats of cutting them. According to news outlet Cleveland.com , arresting officers noted that Slapnik was drunk and rambling, and made \"a profanity-laden statement\" that included this assertion: \"The RNC will take care of them, Donald Trump will fix them because they are scared of Donald Trump.\"\n\n6. White bicyclist threatened with violence, called \"dead man walking.\"\n\nSouthern California motorist Ryan Lewis-who was illegally driving in a bike-share lane-got pissed off when he erroneously thought he'd been cut off by a bicyclist who actually had the right of way. In a video of the incident, Lewis accosts the bicyclist, calling him \"queer\" and a \"punk\" and attempting to bait him by asking, \"What are you gonna do?\"\n\n\"You're a tiny little man, you think you're a big shot,\" Lewis yells in the footage. \"I oughta smack you so fucking good. If there wasn't any witnesses, you know what I'd do to you? I'd pull Trump on ya.\"\n\nLewis, who later said he was \"embarrassed\" (but only after he realized the whole thing was caught on a video that had gone viral) is just one of the many Trumpites who have begun using their candidate's surname as part of a verb phrase that-I'm just guessing here-means \"to do something irrationally violent and worthy of arrest.\"\n\n7. Muslim woman attacked outside a Starbucks in Washington, D.C.\n\nAn African-American Muslim woman was seated on a bench in front of a Starbucks when she was accosted by a random woman screaming Islamophobic epithets. Speaking to WJLA, the woman (who remained anonymous) described the attack, which took place after the woman spotted her wearing a hijab.\n\n\"A Caucasian lady with blond hair walked right past me,\" the woman told the station. \"Then as soon as she sat down, she started talking about me. Saying 'Fucking Muslim. Trash, worthless piece of Muslim trash. You all need to go back to where you came from.'\"\n\nShe managed to pull out her cellphone and capture grainy footage of the verbal harassment, in which you can hear the woman saying, \"You're a terrorist. So stupid.\" She says the woman also told her, \"If Donald Trump wins the nomination, I'm going to vote for him so he can send all of you all back to where you came from.\"\n\nFrightened, the woman called the cops, who showed up but told her that police \"can't do anything about words.\" When the officer left the scene, the woman's harassment allegedly turned physical.\n\n\"She came around and took out a water bottle and poured the contents over my head and all over me... It didn't burn my skin or anything, but it had a strange smell to it.\"\n\nThe incident occurred in April. D.C. police posted surveillance video indicating the woman is a \"person of interest,\" but no arrests have yet been made.\n\n8. Two Muslim women verbally attacked on subway in New York City.\n\nThis time, the awful Trump supporter at the center of this story was riding the F train. Amaira Farheen Hasan was on her way to work one morning this June, when the asshole in question got on the train and started insulting two hijabi Muslim women. In a viral Facebook post about the incident, Hasan says the man began by \"insist[ing] that the two women go back home and take their bombs with them.\" She told the New York Daily News that he went on to note that \"'Donald Trump is right' and railed against the welfare system and undocumented immigrants.\"\n\nHasan says other passengers-\"a black man, a Romanian, a gay man, a bunch of Asians, and a score of others\"-defended the women and essentially told the guy to stuff it. One man, Hasan's Facebook post notes, said, \"This is New York City. The most diverse place in the world. And in New York, we protect our own and we don't give a fuck what anyone looks like or who they love, or any of those things. It's time for you to leave these women alone, sir.\"\n\nShe wrote that when the antagonist got off at his stop, the car erupted in cheers.\n\n[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_large\",\"fid\":\"615653\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"height\":\"480\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\",\"width\":\"457\"}}]]\n\n9. African-American father verbally and physically assaulted in North Carolina.\n\nIsaiah Baskins is a father of three. His youngest daughter, just two months old in April, at the time of the incident, has a congenital heart condition that had already required two surgeries. During a visit to Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, Baskins waited with his two young sons in the hospital family room while his wife and daughter saw the doctor. As the boys played with other kids in the space, a white hospital volunteer suddenly came up to him.\n\nAccording to the family's lawyer, Justin Bamberg, who spoke with ThinkProgress , the woman screamed, \"Get your black kids out of here. Do you even have a job? Do you know what a job is, nâ€Šigger? This is what Donald Trump's talking about, people like you.\"\n\nBaskins began recording shortly thereafter, and the captured footage shows volunteer Donna Lorraine Bridger, 68, shouting, kicking and charging at Baskins in an astonishing display. Baskins says Bridger was polite when he and his kids initially entered, but changed her tune after she saw him speaking with a white woman whose own kids appeared to be biracial. He thinks she assumed things about \"misegenation\"-as a Trump supporter would put it-on his part.\n\nBridger was let go from the hospital and charged with simple assault.\n\n10. Muslims leaving prayer services receive death threats in California.\n\nOn a Friday last December, according to the Mercury News , William Celli stood outside of a Richmond mosque and yelled at the worshippers who were exiting, \"I'm going to kill you all!\"\n\nPolice later were informed that Celli might be building bombs in his home, so they quickly obtained a warrant and conducted a search. There, officers located what looked like \"a possible homemade explosive device,\" which was detonated by a bomb squad. Celli, who pleaded guilty, was sentenced to 90 days in jail and three years probation .\n\nAmong the loss of privileges during that time includes suspension of his access to Facebook. In the leadup to his arrest, Celli had posted numerous anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant and anti-Mexican rants. He'd also expressed admiration for Donald Trump, whom he once called a \" great point man .\" In another post, Celli wrote , \"I'll follow this MAN to the end of the world.\""

      "text": "My Visit With Troy Davis, a Man Facing Death on October 27th\n\n***UPDATE: On October 24, Troy Davis was granted a stay of execution . Go here for more information.*** October 23rd is a Global Day of Action for Troy Davis. Go here for more information. They come out of the corridor all dressed up, with perfectly ironed white suits with blue collars and tennis shoes, a white smile upon their shaved faces. It is visiting day, and they have been waiting for it since last week. They lean in a line against the yellow painted gates with their arms straight out, waiting for the warden to release their handcuffs, and then they dissolve in the crowded room filled with kids and antsy wives who offer them prepackaged foods just purchased from the vending machines in the hall -- their gourmet lunch for the day. But Troy Davis is not allowed in the visitation room with the rest of them because he is a death row inmate. Visitors see him in a separate room, two gates away from where others greet guests. Inside the prison, he is known by the number 657378, since the day he was confined to cell 79 on the top floor of the G-house in the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison in Jackson, Ga. He was convicted for the murder of a police officer when he was 20 years old. He has always said he is innocent. Davis has been sitting on Georgia's death row for 17 years, charged with the assault of Larry Young, a homeless man, and the murder of police officer Mark Allen MacPhail in the parking lot of a Burger King in Savannah, Ga. on August 19, 1989. Seven of the nine eyewitnesses who testified that Davis was present at the shooting have recanted their testimony, saying police pressured them into making false statements. Their recantations have never been heard in court. No weapon has ever been found, and no physical evidence connects Davis to the crime. After years of litigation, Davis exhausted his appeals to the Georgia Supreme Court in March 2008 when the court denied him an evidentiary hearing. He was denied clemency from the Georgia Pardons and Paroles Board on Sept. 8, 2008. His appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was not considered until Sept. 23, when the court convened an emergency session and gave Davis a stay less than two hours before his scheduled execution, due to the abundance of incongruent evidence in favor of his innocence. The stay gave Davis and his many supporters new hope. But on Oct. 14, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to give Davis's case a full hearing, leaving the lower court verdict intact. A new death warrant was issued few days later and a third execution date is scheduled for Oct. 27 at 7pm. I met Davis inside the walls of the prison for the first time, when, after a two-month correspondence, I decided to fly to Jackson to talk to him in person. I wanted to know for myself how someone could sleep at night, knowing that death might soon be whispering in his ears for a crime he says he did not commit. The answer was more powerful than I had expected. \"My faith has taught me that if you give all your worries to God he will carry your burdens,\" Davis wrote in a letter to me sent the day after my visit. \"It's God that carried me through death's valley and took my worries away.\" For Davis, faith is the door to freedom. Having faith makes you stronger than your family and able to support them more than they are supporting you, he said, because they are the ones who will be left behind once you are gone and you have to show them you are not afraid to die. \"Sometimes all of this seems like it's happening to someone else. I sometimes dream to be free, but in each dream my family is 18-and-a-half years younger, and my father is still alive,\" said Davis during an in-person interview in April 2008. \"I am disappointed at the system, but refuse to become bitter and angry, because I still have a lot of fight left in me Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ I have too much to live for to give up, to give up on myself means I have given up on my family as well, but we are in this together and I cannot give up now.\" Meeting Davis not only changed the person I am today, it changed the way I perceived death, and prison, and the smell of prepackaged food. Walking though the prison's metal gates in the early hours of that April day, I felt sick to my stomach. Standing in line with mothers, daughters and wives of inmates, I felt out of place and inappropriate. I had not lost anyone dear to the prison's walls; I was just a cocky journalist in search of a scoop. But my feeling of regret soon vanished once I saw the smile on Davis's face, and perceived how much my interest in his case changed his day. I was not allowed to bring a recorder in to my interview with Davis. I wasn't even allowed pen and paper. Eight hours after I sat down with him, my head filled with interesting thoughts and minus $10 in prepackaged food later, I left his cell to pour my thoughts on paper. Six months have passed since that day. I've tried to start writing this article ten times, trying different structures and voices and perspectives. I'm finally ready to explore my chat with Davis that foggy afternoon of late April. Why now? Because much has changed since that weekend when I talked to him in person. I think it is time for others to know what I found in that cell that so captured my attention, especially now that Davis is facing his third and final execution date on Oct 27. Before prison, Davis was a big brother to his siblings. He took night classes to get his high school diploma so he would have time to take care of his younger sister Kimberly when she became paralyzed. He would drop her off and pick her up from school since their parents were separated, their oldest sister Martina was in the army, and their mom worked the day shift, he said. After he graduated from high school, Davis worked in his father's construction company. Every week, he took $50 from his paycheck and snuck the cash into his mother's room to help her pay the bills, he said. It never crossed his mind that hanging out with the wrong people on a summer night in 1989 could have cost him his life as a free man, or that an innocent man -- which he insists he is -- could be slated to die under the American justice system. \"For an innocent man like me the justice system continues to fail me. Why is that so hard to admit they made a mistake? What kind of person knows he coerced false evidence to convict an innocent man and still refuses to right the wrong? Who is more barbaric then, them or the people they put in prison?\" he asked in a letter dated April 27. \"I would like to ask society how long would you remain quiet while innocent people suffer, while we remain on death row and unjustly get convicted? When is it that enough is enough? When will you speak up and fight to stop injustice everywhere? Or will you wait until someone you love becomes a victim to the system, too?\" *** It is no surprise that a man facing death would say he is innocent of the crime. But Davis is not alone in claiming his innocence. While investigating Davis's story, I came across a similar case: the case of Rubin Cantu, a 22-year-old Hispanic man who was executed in Texas in 1993. As in Davis's case, Cantu was convicted based solely on eyewitness identification. He was found to be innocent -- after he was killed. Among the documents on file in Davis's case was a letter from Samuel D. Millsap Jr., a former Texas District Attorney and the prosecutor in Cantu's case. In the letter, Millsap said he has concerns about having convicted Rubin Cantu for a crime he might not have committed solely on the basis of one eyewitness's testimony. Millsap said he thinks Troy Davis's case is similar to Cantu's. \"In the Davis case now, the question is if we are about to execute a man in circumstances in which it is likely or, at least, there is a substantial chance that he did not commit the crime that he was convicted for,\" he said. \"It seems to me that what courts have an obligation to do is try to make sure that justice is done and that the innocents are protected. Personally, what the Georgia Court has done by refusing to grant Troy Davis a hearing is really the ultimate in form over substance.\" Millsap believes in Davis's innocence. In 2007, he wrote a letter to the Pardons and Paroles Board advocating clemency for Davis. Amnesty International has also been active in Davis's case, publishing a detailed report on his trial's flaws and organizing weekly rallies in Atlanta. *** \"Being on death watch is something unimaginable. I did not realize the seriousness of it until it was all over,\" Davis said when we talked in prison in April. \"Imagine having to fill out paperwork on who will visit you on your last 24 hours alive. Imagine writing goodbye letters to your loved ones. Planning your last meal. Walking to each death row inmates' cell, shaking their hands while they say 'good luck,' while I was responding 'I will be back.' Imagine seeing grownup men with tears rolling down their faced who you did not know they cared so much about you. Imagine filling out papers on who will receive your personal property and your dead body.\" Davis will go through the motions of waiting for a police officer to come in to his cells to take all his measurements from shoe size to shoulder width. He has been through this twice before. \"They take your shoe size, they measure you up so they can find someone your size they can use to try out the scenario of the execution,\" he said during our talk on April 27. \"They make sure they choose the same size guards to attend the execution so they can deal with you if you resist them.\" Then they will put him in a 35-foot-tall isolation cell with a steel toilet, a steel cart and a 24-hour camera monitoring him as if he were a \"museum display,\" he said. When he went through this process before, he was given a Bible, some sheets of paper a pen, envelopes and an old TV/radio. They gave him clothing that were two sizes too big, so that if he tried to fight the guards his pants would fall off and he would have to surrender because he would be stumbling all over his clothing. Besides his faith in God, Davis says one person has kept him sane through his years in prison -- his \"angel,\" his older sister Martina Correia, a breast cancer survivor who has been by his side for all these years, even when the strength to fight seemed to fade away. He said without her he would have probably given up on life and freedom much earlier. \"Watching how Martina sacrificed her dreams to free her brother inspired me to fight harder and helped me to think about my family before I allowed myself to get into any trouble that would keep me from seeing them,\" said Davis on a letter dated April 8. \"I thank God for her daily. I want to build her a house, I want to put her son De Jaun through college so he can follow his dream to find a cure for Cancer, which is what she is fighting.\" Correia splits her free time working as an executive director of the National Black Leadership Initiative on Cancer and as the National Steering Committee Chair for Amnesty International. She travels the world in the name of her brother, because innocence matters for everyone, she said. \"We are in this fight to win,\" she said in an email exchange on Sept. 2. \"I do it for the man he is. I will rest when he is free.\" The \"stay tough\" attitude seems to run in the family. It comes through in a letter from Davis written right after the Georgia Supreme Court denied him a new trial. A new execution date was looming, but Davis was still sure justice would prevail. \"Personally I think things will work out before then,\" he wrote in his last letter to me, dated Sept. 18, 2008. \"I'll be home living the life of a free man soon.\""

      "text": "Donald Trump Is a Menace to American Society, Presidential Candidate or Not\n\nWhile there is plenty of reason to fear a President Trump, even citizen Trump is a real and present danger to society. The GOP presidential nominee has a long personal record of aggression, cruelty and violence, even against those closest to him, that proves he's a threat in any capacity.\n\nWere he not the son of a millionaire and instead, say, a poor or black kid of any class, Trump's violent streak, visible early on, would likely have branded him a problem child headed for a troubled adulthood. At the age of 7 or 8, by his own account, Trump physically attacked an adult instructor at his school. \"In the second grade I actually gave a teacher a black eye,\" he stated in the 1987 book The Art of the Deal . \"I punched my music teacher because I didn't think he knew anything about music and I almost got expelled.\" Trump has said he is \"not proud,\" of the incident; nonetheless, he cites it as \"clear evidence that even early on I had a tendency to stand up and make my opinions known in a very forceful way.\"\n\nSuch flashes of senseless violence were common for Trump as a child. Dennis Burnham, who grew up in Trump's childhood neighborhood, told the Washington Post , \"Donald was known to be a bully. I was a little kid, and my parents didn't want me beaten up.\" Burnham says as a baby, his mother once briefly left him in a playpen in the backyard, which faced the Trump grounds, and shortly thereafter, returned to catch Trump-four years older than her son-throwing rocks at the baby. \"She saw Donald standing at the fence using the playpen for target ­practice,\" Burnham told the newspaper.\n\nTrump himself has implied there are numerous unrecounted examples of his juvenile brutishness, unwittingly revealing that he has long reveled in violence. \"I always loved to fight,\" Trump told Michael D'Antonio, author of The Truth About Trump and Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success . \"All types of fights, including physical.\" Steve Nachtigall, a New Jersey-based doctor who lived near Trump as a child, recounted watching Trump and his friends jump another kid and beat him up. \"It's kind of like a little video snippet that remains in my brain because I think it was so unusual and terrifying at that age,\" Nachtigall said. \"He was a loudmouth bully.\" Other childhood neighbors told the Post that Trump hated to lose, and \"could erupt in anger, pummeling another boy or smashing a baseball bat if he made an out.\"\n\nBy Trump's own reckoning, this early proclivity toward violence and bullying-currently on prominent, frightening display in his campaign-remains fundamental to who he is. \"When I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself now, I'm basically the same,\" Trump told biographer D'Antonio. \"The temperament is not all that different.\"\n\nTrump's childhood tendency toward selfishness and domination manifested in other ways that might seem innocuous in another person, but in Trump's case, reveal the seeds that blossomed into his cutthroat, winner-take-all style of doing business. In The Art of the Deal , Trump says his younger and \"much quieter and... easy going\" brother Robert often tells a story about \"when it became clear to him where [Trump] was headed.\" The two siblings were playing with blocks, and foreshadowing the skyscrapers he would later construct, Trump tried to build a tall stack. Realizing he'd run out of blocks, he asked to borrow some of his brother's, who obliged, saying, \"Okay, but you have to give them back when you're done.\" Robert unknowingly became the first of thousands who claim they've been lied to, defrauded and otherwise shafted by Trump. \"I ended up using all of my blocks, and then all of his, and when I was done, I'd created a beautiful building,\" Trump reflects . \"I liked it so much that I glued the whole thing together. And that was the end of Robert's blocks.\"\n\nAmidst the fights, attacks and other behaviors he has labeled \"aggressive,\" Trump has said , \"as an adolescent [he] was mostly interested in creating mischief,\" and that he liked to \"stir things up\" and \"test people.\" That makes him sound like an adorable scamp, when in fact, others paint a picture of a troublemaker protected by his father's money and social stature. One former teacher at his Queens private school said that Trump , \"would sit with his arms folded with this look on his face-I use the word surly-almost daring you to say one thing or another that wouldn't settle with him.\" As a student, Trump was so defiant and prone to rule-breaking that former classmate Paul Onish told NPR his name became synonymous with punishments handed out by the school for behaving badly. \"We used to refer to our detention as a 'DT'-a 'Donny Trump'-because he got more of them than most other people in the class,\" Onish said.\n\nTrump's father Fred, often described as an authoritarian figure who prioritized business interests over his family, likely egged on this behavior by creating an atmosphere of toxic masculinity in which any sign of weakness was tantamount to failure. Trump biographer Harry Hurt III, author of Lost Tycoon , wrote that the elder Trump repeatedly told his sons , \"you are a killer... you are a king... you are a killer... you are a king.\" Trump's acting out may well be attributed to the pressures applied by his father. The psychological underpinnings-and possible personality disorders-at the root of the billionaire's unruliness have been explored by experts in numerous other articles . Whatever the case, fed up with his son's out-of-control behavior, Fred shipped Donald off to the New York Military Academy to complete his education.\n\nWriting for Politico , Trump biographer D'Antonio describes NYMA as a \"place that was supposed to civilize boys who were bullies and toughen up those who appeared to be weak,\" and that it placed Trump in an \"aggressive and isolate subculture that prized physical toughness and defined manhood in the basest terms.\" Many of the staff members were men who had fought in World War II, and they treated students with the harshness and brutality of young soldiers. Trump characterized the institution as a \" tough \" place, where physical abuse was not uncommon. \"In those days they'd smack the hell out of you,\" Trump told D'Antonio. \"It was not like today where you smack somebody and you go to jail.\" In another interview with the Washington Post, Trump said there were \"a lot of drill sergeants...And they were tough, and it was less politically correct than it is today... You had to learn how to survive, essentially, with some of these guys.\"\n\nYet Trump thrived at NYMA, even finding a mentor in Major Theodore Dobias, a man he told D'Antonio \"could be a fucking prick. He absolutely would rough you up.\" Trump has said he fared well with Dobias by showing the major he \"respected his authority but that he didn't intimidate me.\" Some students have claimed Trump's privilege and family name afforded a measure of protection not extended to others. But Trump's previous reputation seems to have remained intact while at the institution, according to classmates. One of Trump's peers told NPR he had an \"air of superiority,\" while another said \"he was so competitive that everybody who could come close to him he had to destroy.\" Perhaps most telling is a story from Trump's NYMA roommate Ted Levine, who recounts how Trump ripped the sheets off his bed during an inspection because it hadn't been properly made. \"Then I lost it. I totally lost it. So I think I hit him with a broomstick,\" Levine recounted, who at the time stood at 4'11\" to Trump's 6'2\". \"And he came back at me-with his hands. He was bigger than me. And it took three people to get him off me.\"\n\nTrump has said that in his time at the school he \"learned discipline-how to dish it out and otherwise.\" It seems just as likely that, as D'Antonio has written, Trump's success at NYMA was actually a sign of an ever deepening pathology. \"Like many children who are abused by their caretakers,\" D'Antonio writes, \"Trump came to identify with\" the adult men on staff who brutalized the students in their charge. The ethos of NYMA, where boys were socialized to believe that manhood is intrinsically linked with subjugating, intimidating and dominating those who might be identified as \"weak,\" coupled with Fred Trump's insistence that \"most people are weaklings\" undeserving of respect, all helped ensure Trump grew into a bigger, better and more dedicated bully, as evidenced not only throughout this electoral season, but over the last few decades of his public life.\n\nPart and parcel with the toxic masculinity of Trump's youth is the misogyny and sexism that has been part of his entire public life. We've grown familiar with Trump's intense misogyny through his countless attacks on various figures via social media , from Rosie O'Donnell to Fox News host Megyn Kelly , who understatedly noted, \"It's clear we may have overestimated his anger-management skills.\" On the campaign trail, Trump has heaped abuse on NBC's Katy Tur and urged his audience to follow suit, resulting in the journalist requiring constant Secret Service protection. There was the time a few years ago when an unhinged Trump mailed writer Gail Collins a copy of one of her columns with the words \"The Face of a Dog!\" written across her photo.\n\nLong before that, in 1992, Trump offered a glimpse into his feelings on gender equality when he stated in an interview with New York Magazine, \"Women, you have to treat them like shit.\" In 1997 's Trump: The Art of the Comeback, he mused, \"Women have one of the great acts of all time. The smart ones act very feminine and needy, but inside they are real killers...I have seen women manipulate men with just a twitch of their eye-or perhaps another body part.\" In the 2005 book, TrumpNation: The Art of Being The Donald , he managed to seamlessly display his blend of cinephilia and woman-hating into a single quote: \"My favorite part [of Pulp Fiction ] is when Sam has his gun out in the diner and he tells the guy to tell his girlfriend to shut up. Tell that bitch to be cool. Say: 'Bitch be cool.' I love those lines.\"\n\nThen there's the 2013 tweet from Trump in which he essentially states that rape is a natural outcome of women and men being in close quarters. \"26,000 unreported sexual assaults in the military-only 238 convictions,\" Trump wrote . \"What did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together?\" This insight is made yet more frightening in light of the rape and/or attempted sexual assault accusations three women have made against Trump. A lawsuit filed in federal court in June alleges that Trump viciously and violently raped a 13-year-old girl in 1994; the accuser contends the assault took place at the home of Trump's friend, billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, who went to jail in 2008 on charges of soliciting underage girls for sex.\n\nTrump's 1990s business associate Jill Harth has filed a complaint alleging she was relentlessly sexually harassed by Trump, culminating in an attempted rape at the billionaire's Mar-A-Largo estate. According to the book Lost Tycoon , in a sworn deposition during their 1992 divorce, ex-wife Ivana stated that Trump once brutally beat her, ripping out her hair in clumps, and raped her. Before the book's release, Trump's lawyers sent the author a statement from Ivana which recants that charge. \"During a deposition given by me in connection with my matrimonial case...I referred to this as a 'rape,' but I do not want my words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense,\" the statement reads. (The New York Times and Gannett, which owns USA Today, have jointly requested the court unseal the divorce documents, arguing that Trump's \"treatment of women\" is \"directly relevant to the presidential election.\")\n\nThe latest evidence of Trump's dangerousness are his calls for violence at his rallies. He boasted to an audience that he would \"beat the crap out of\" a would-be attacker. In Iowa, he advised supporters to \"knock the crap\" out of protesters with encouragement that he would \"pay for the legal fees.\" On two separate occasions, he has wistfully longed for \"the old days,\" when a protester would be \"carried out on a stretcher.\" \"But today,\" he lamented , \"everybody's politically correct.\" He remarked that supporters pummeling a protester in North Carolina was \"a beautiful thing,\" and discussing the incident later, wished for increased violence at his events, saying, \"that's what we need a little bit more of.\" At a Missouri campaign stop , Trump said \"part of\" the problem today \"is nobody wants to hurt each other anymore.\" Discussing the potential for Black Lives Matter to interrupt a protest , Trump threatened, \"I don't know if I'll do the fighting myself or if other people will.\" There are too many examples to list, but you get the picture.\n\nVideo courtesy of the New York Times.\n\nWe should not be surprised that a man with such horrifying views and a propensity for violence would actually boost torture, saying that if elected, he'll \"bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding\" and that he'd order the killings of terrorists' families. Trump has praised bloody dictatorships in Russia, China and North Korea, even applauding Saddam Hussein for how \"good\" he was at \"killing terrorists.\" (\"They didn't read 'em the rights. They didn't talk. They were a terrorist-it was over.\") As Joe Biden pointed out in his speech at the DNC, only someone lacking the human traits of \"empathy and compassion\" would take such delight in telling people, before a television audience of millions, \"You're fired.\" Trump responded by saying of the DNC's speakers-among them the Muslim-American Gold Star couple the Khans , who Trump would later publicly insult-that he wanted to \"hit [them] so hard.\"\n\nHe's backed up by his campaign team, a group of thugs and lunatics selected by Trump, undoubtedly, because their views match his own. Trump adviser, right-wing shyster and notorious racist Roger Stone, has tweeted that numerous public figures should be shot, hung or executed. Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski physically assaulted a female reporter in an incident caught on video . Current campaign head Paul Manafort, a close associate of Stone's, has built his career on aiding dictators and despots known for human rights violations including \"government-sanctioned torture, detainment, and rape.\" Recently, Trump's former North Carolina state director, Earl Phillip, was sued by another campaign staffer who said Phillip pulled a gun on him and senior members of the Trump team \" did nothing \" when they learned of the incident. Trump has assembled not so much a campaign staff as a morally bereft street gang in suits.\n\nBut even the members of Trump's inner campaign circle recognized his overstep in hinting that Second Amendment gun nuts should take out Hillary Clinton. Even after months of cheering on his followers' calls to \"lock her up\" and more extreme threats, Trump's wink-nudge assassination suggestion brought home just how hateful and violent a man we're dealing with. \"Hillary wants to abolish, essentially, the Second Amendment,\" Trump said , a lie he has repeated over and over again. \"By the way, and if she gets the pick, if she gets the pick of her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I dunno.\"\n\nIt is unprecedented that a viable candidate for the presidency has required a talking to by the Secret Service for tacitly urging violence upon an opponent . As in childhood, when Trump's privilege led others to look away from his impulsive violence and bullying, his stature as a powerful man and billionaire contender protect him now. \"If someone else had said that outside the hall,\" ex-CIA head Michael Hayden told CNN, \"he'd be in the back of a police wagon now with the Secret Service questioning him.\"\n\nIn many ways, Trump is the natural end result of a GOP that has leaned toward violent rhetoric and racial divisiveness for years, starting with the Southern Strategy and more recently witnessed in Sarah Palin's 2010 crosshairs map that included a target for former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who a year later was shot in the head by mass shooter Jared Loughner. The Republican Party has been fomenting hate and bigotry for decades through messaging that has grown increasingly full-throated-the language used against President Obama during the last eight years alone is a treasure trove of right-wing scariness. Trump is what all that messaging hath wrought and then some. His fanbase of racists and xenophobes, whipped into a frenzy, have responded to his calls for violence with violence. This goes far beyond the beatings doled out to protesters at Trump rallies. In May, two Boston brothers viciously beat an Hispanic man and admiringly quoted Trump's stance on \"illegals\" as they were being arrested. Just days ago, an enraged motorist threatened to \" pull a Trump \" on a bicyclist he wrongly accused of cutting him off. Earlier this week, after a Queens, New York imam and his assistant were fatally gunned down in broad daylight, a local Muslim resident told the New York Daily News, \"We blame Donald Trump for this...Trump and his drama has created Islamophobia.\"\n\nThe media, which has begun to more forcefully take Trump to task for his antics, initially served to help the billionaire in his rise to power. Ann Jones delivered a powerful indictment of this aiding and abetting, writing on TomDispatch:\n\n\"The TV networks, like the media generally, and the Republican establishment thought his candidacy was a joke, yet in the process of publicizing that joke, they gave him an estimated $2 billion in free air time. Often in those months, as in his post-primary 'press conferences,' he was not challenged but awarded endless time to rant and ramble on, monopolizing the perceptions of viewers and networks alike. To justify their focus on him and their relative neglect of all other candidates, the networks cited the bottom line. Trump, they said, made them a lot of money. And they made him a daily inescapable presence in our lives.\"\n\nIf he were of more humble beginnings, Donald Trump would likely have been tracked for state supervision a long time ago. Instead of a ritzy military academy, he would have been sent to a juvenile facility; instead of having his threats dismissed as the brash ramblings of a billionaire, he would be viewed as a threat to public safety; instead of a list of violent actions and statements carried out with impunity, there would be a rap sheet. We shouldn't just fret about having this man in the Oval Office; we should fear his presence on our streets.\n\nIf any normal citizen had relentlessly bullied people since childhood, lashed out physically at those in his personal life, publicly supported enemies of the American state, allegedly sexually assaulted multiple women, and dog whistled for the death of his competitor in a political race, he would have been put away for reasons of the public good. (Unarmed black kids have died for far less.) Trump would be recognized as a potential threat to himself and others, and all the above evidence would recommend having him put away.\n\nRapper T.I. recently said in an interview , \"If I were to do the things Trump's doing, I would be called a common thug. If I was to say, 'If somebody who doesn't look like us or agree with us shows up at my concert, and you beat him up and get locked up, I'll pay for your legal fees,' that'd be like a mob boss, you know?\" It's a statement that's alarming in its overwhelming truth. While the danger of Trump as a world leader has been recognized by countless sources, there has been little consideration of the everyday menace he presents. Based solely on the facts of his life, would Trump be a man you'd want near your children or family, living next door or in your neighborhood? Personalize the image of Trump, known for starting fights or goading others into them, for treating people with disrespect, for relentlessly attacking others by any means at his disposal, and the picture becomes a bit clearer.\n\nVideo courtesy of the New York Times.\n\nA 2008 study from the University of Chicago found that brain scans revealed teens with a history of bullying actually take pleasure in watching the pain and suffering of others. I was reminded of a quote from The Art of the Deal , in which Trump states, \"When people wrong you, go after those people, because it is a good feeling and because other people will see you doing it. I love getting even.\" Spoken like a true bully, right to the end. Win or lose this election (and let's hope for the latter), Trump is a risk no one can afford. He's a genuinely scary man of troubling character, who will continue to cause untold suffering to those close to him and to the world, should he succeed in his mission to become Commander-in-Chief.\n\nSome part of Trump may even recognize this about himself, and that may be the reason he refuses to look inward. \"When you start studying yourself too deeply, you start seeing things that maybe you don't want to see,\" he said in an interview with Time magazine some years back. \"And if there's a rhyme and reason people can figure you out,\" Trump added, \"and once they can figure you out, you're in big trouble.\""

All Rights Reserved.\n\nRICHLAND, Miss. (AP) - A white Mississippi police officer has lost his job after telling a Hispanic man to \"go back to Mexico\" while the officer was responding to a disturbance at a home.\n\nThe officer resigned after he was \"relieved of duty\" for using \"derogatory slurs,\" Richland Police Chief Adrian Ready said in a statement Wednesday.\n\n\"This type of language is not only unacceptable, but it also undermines the trust and respect that we work hard to build within our community,\" Ready said.\n\nThe officer, Jeremy Rast, responded to a home disturbance call Sunday with other officers in Richland, a Jackson suburb. Rast told WLBT-TV that the officers exchanged words with a group of men across the road.\n\nWLBT reported that it had obtained video that one of the men, Luis Rodriguez, made of Rast talking to him.\n\n\"Like, why don't you go back to Mexico or something,\" Rast said on the video. \"Like, whatever. I don't care. Just get the f-- out of Richland for me, please. ... I do not like y'all being here.\"\n\nRodriguez replied that he did not like officers being on his property. Rast responded that Rodriguez cannot legally own property, adding, \"you're illegal.\"\n\nRast also told Rodriguez: \"I'm going look for you every shift to try to arrest you.\"\n\nRodriguez and Rast both told WLBT that they had encountered each other previously.\n\nRodriguez said he is a native of Honduras and a graduate of Richland High School. Rodriguez said because of the statements made by Rast, he is preparing to move out of Mississippi. He said he's concerned he will be targeted by others in law enforcement.\n\n\"Even though he got fired, there might be still some more police officers who think of us like him,\" Rodriguez said.\n\nRast told WLBT he spoke harshly out of frustration with Rodriguez.\n\n\"I did make some comments that were inappropriate and unprofessional, I take full responsibility for that,\" Rast said. \"(I'm) not proud of what I said.\"\n\nRast also said he wants to continue a law enforcement career.\n\nRichland is in Rankin County, where five former sheriff's department officers and a former Richland police officer pleaded guilty to breaking into a home without a warrant and torturing two Black men in an hourslong attack that included beatings, repeated uses of stun guns and assaults with a sex toy before one of the victims was shot in the mouth. Those six former officers - some of whom called themselves the Goon Squad - were sentenced on federal charges in March and state charges in April.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Blackwell, the suspect in Friday's battery acid attack, appears in a Milwaukee County Court in Milwaukee on Wednesday, Nov. 6, 2019. Blackwell, 61, had been arrested on a preliminary charge of aggravated battery after 42-year-old Mahud Villalaz said Blackwell threw acid on his face after a series of anti-immigrant remarks that Villalaz finally countered by saying he is a U.S. citizen. (Mike De Sisti/Milwaukee Journal Sentinel via AP)\n\nMILWAUKEE (AP) - A 61-year-old white Milwaukee man accused of throwing acid on a Hispanic man's face will be charged with a hate crime, increasing the possible sentence he may receive if convicted, prosecutors announced Wednesday.\n\nProsecutors filed one charge against Clifton Blackwell - first-degree reckless injury - but added the sentencing enhancers of hate crime and use of a dangerous weapon. The two enhancers could add 10 years in prison if he's convicted of first-degree reckless injury, which is punishable by up to 25 years.\n\nThe victim, Mahud Villalaz, 42, said his attacker approached him near a restaurant Friday night and confronted him about being parked too close to a bus stop, according to charging documents. Prosecutors said Blackwell then asked, \"Why did you invade my country?\" and \"Why don't you respect my laws?\"\n\nVillalaz said he moved his car but that Blackwell continued to berate him, calling him \"illegal\" and telling him to \"go back, go back,\" followed by an expletive. Villalaz said he called Blackwell a racist, also using an expletive. Villalaz said Blackwell threw the acid on him after Villalaz said \"everyone come from somewhere first\" and that American Indians had been in the country the longest.\n\nSurveillance video from the restaurant recorded the attack, which left Villalaz with second-degree burns on his face.\n\nVillalaz is a U.S. citizen who immigrated from Peru.\n\nBlackwell made his first court appearance Wednesday to be advised of the charges he faces. Bond was set at $20,000 but it's on the condition he wear an electronic monitoring bracelet. He's still being held at the Milwaukee County jail and his public defender did not immediately return a call.\n\nThe attack on Villalaz comes at a time when the Anti-Defamation League says extreme anti-immigrant views have become part of the political mainstream in recent years through sharp rhetoric by anti-immigration groups and politicians, including President Donald Trump.\n\nWhite House spokesman Judd Deere said Monday that the Trump administration has repeatedly condemned racism and violence.\n\nInvestigators who searched Blackwell's home found among other things four bottles of sulfuric acid, muriatic acid, and two bottles of Kleen-Out drain opener that was 100 % lye, according to the search warrant. Additional conditions for his bond are that he have no contact with acids or large batteries, or possess dangerous weapons or firearms. His next court appearance is Nov. 15.\n\nBefore filing the charge, Milwaukee District Attorney John Chisholm said during an interview with Wisconsin Public Radio that his office was looking to determine whether the attack was motivated \"in whole or in part\" based on the victim's race. He said prosecutors would look \"very closely first at the underlying offenses and then we'll make a determination whether the facts support the hate crime.\"\n\n\"But it's obviously a concern to many people not just in this community but really around the country right now,\" he said.\n\nJust as Blackwell was in court, Villalaz spoke briefly to reporters to say he was pleased with the charges and thankful for \"the people that have worried about me.\" He said Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin called him to say she was \"very sad\" about what happened and offered to help however she can.\n\nHis mother, Jacqueline P. Blackwell, of California, told the Journal Sentinel he had sought care with the Department of Veterans Affairs in Milwaukee for post-traumatic stress.\n\n\"I was comfortable that he was getting good care with the VA,\" she told the newspaper.\n\nHis brother, Arthur Eugene Blackwell of Evergreen, Colorado, told the AP that Clifton served nearly four years in the U.S. Marines and was stationed at the Panama Canal around the time Manuel Noriega was captured and removed in 1990. A Marine official told AP that the branch doesn't have a record matching Blackwell's name and birthdate.\n\nState court records show Blackwell was convicted in a 2006 Rusk County case of false imprisonment and pointing a gun at a person in a case where he held four hunters at gunpoint because they were on his property.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Jeff Baenen contributed from Minneapolis.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nBOSTON (AP) - Donald Trump on Friday denounced a violent attack against a homeless Hispanic man in Boston whose attacker told police he was inspired, in part, by Trump's rhetoric that people in the country illegally should be deported. It was a change in tone for the Republican presidential candidate, who's known for his incendiary remarks.\n\n\"Boston incident is terrible. We need energy and passion, but we must treat each other with respect,\" Trump tweeted after coming under criticism for failing to condemn the attack more strongly. \"I would never condone violence.\"\n\nScott and Steve Leader were arrested early Wednesday on charges they beat a 58-year-old Hispanic man while he slept near a Boston train station. One of the brothers later told police Trump \"was right\" about deporting \"all these illegals,\" according to a police report.\n\nThe comments marked a change in tone for Trump, who on Wednesday appeared far less troubled by it.\n\nAfter being told about the attack at a press conference ahead of New Hampshire town hall on Wednesday evening, Trump said it was the first he'd heard of it.\n\n\"I think that would be a shame,\" he said, before adding: \"I will say, the people that are following me are very passionate. They love this country. They want this country to be great again. And they are very passionate.\"\n\nTrump has inflamed Latinos by describing Mexican immigrants as \"criminals\" and \"rapists\" and saying he would build a wall between the United States and Mexico to crack down on illegal immigration. He recently said he would deport the millions of people already in the United States illegally, sort them into groups of \"good ones\" and \"bad ones\" and then allow those deemed good to re-enter the country.\n\nPolice and the Suffolk County district attorney's office said the two brothers came across the victim while heading home from a Boston Red Sox game and proceeded to urinate on him, punch him and beat him with a metal pole while he slept. Witnesses flagged down a state trooper at about 12:30 a.m. Wednesday after they saw the attack and reported seeing the brothers walk away laughing, prosecutors said. The victim was treated for a broken nose, serious bruises and other injuries.\n\nScott Leader told troopers after his arrest: \"Donald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported,\" according to a state police report.\n\nHe also suggested his behavior was acceptable because the victim was homeless and Hispanic, police said.\n\nThe brothers were arraigned Wednesday on a slew of charges, including assault and battery, according to prosecutors. They were being held without bail on charges including assault and indecent exposure. They pleaded not guilty.\n\nMexican officials on Thursday condemned the attack and said they would follow the investigation \"very closely\" to ensure that those responsible are held accountable.\n\n\"Mexico strongly condemns this incident and calls for recognition of the contribution made by the immigrant community to the economy, society, values and culture of the United States and for this to constitute the axis of the close ties between our societies,\" the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on its website.\n\nCourt records show Scott Leader served a year in prison for a hate crime against a Moroccan coffee shop worker after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, The Boston Globe reported.\n\nAttorneys who appeared with the brothers for their arraignment couldn't be reached for comment Friday.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nThe family of an unarmed Hispanic man who was shot to death outside his mother's Manchester home in April joined social justice advocates Monday in taking issue with a prosecutor's report that found the shooting was justified.\n\nIn his report Friday, Tolland State's Attorney Matthew Gedansky said four SWAT officers from the Capitol Region Emergency Services Team fired because they believed 27-year-old Jose \"Jay\" Soto had a weapon.\n\nDuring a news conference Monday, Anthony Vazquez, the boyfriend of Soto's mother, insisted the family had told officers over and over during an hours-long standoff on April 2 that there were no guns in the house. Soto had arrived just days before, with nothing but the clothes on his back, to quarantine with his family, he said.\n\n\"We told everybody that night, 'There's no guns. If you guys want, I can go back in and I'll get him out for you guys,'\" Vazquez said. \"They didn't allow us back in the house.\"\n\nSoto was shot when he burst through the front door pointing his hands at police in a \"firing position\" with an object they believed was a gun, Gendansky wrote. That object turned out to be a cellphone.\n\nMembers of the group \"Justice for Jay\" on Monday questioned why police were not wearing body cameras, did not record any of their phone negotiations with Soto and did not call any mental health experts to the scene despite knowing Soto had mental health issues.\n\nThe standoff and confrontation began when two parole officers went looking for Soto, who had disappeared from a halfway house in October 2019, while on parole after serving time for a 2013 robbery. They called in the CREST team when Soto refused to leave and began making threats, authorities said.\n\n\"If the protocols that allowed CREST to set up and bring in an armored vehicle and set it up right at the front door can be managed differently in the future, that would be great,\" said the Rev.

(AP Photo/Josh Edelson)\n\nOAKLAND, Calif. (AP) - The family of an unarmed 26-year-old San Francisco Bay Area man is struggling to understand how a minor confrontation with police led to his death on the same day a jury in Minneapolis began considering similar circumstances in the George Floyd case.\n\nOfficers in Alameda, California, responded to a park on April 19 to check reports that Mario Gonzalez was acting strangely and appeared to be breaking security tags off of alcohol bottles that he had in two drugstore baskets.\n\nGonzalez died after three officers and a civilian parking enforcement employee pinned him face down on the ground for more than five minutes, according to body camera video made public this week by police amid three separate investigations. An attorney for the officers said they did nothing wrong.\n\nPolice said Gonzalez had a medical emergency while in an altercation with officers.\n\nBut his brother, Jerry Gonzalez, told The Associated Press in an interview Wednesday that the video \"presented a story that was really different.\n\n\"The medical emergency that they're talking about was induced by three officers on his back,\" he said.\n\nThe brother added that Gonzalez liked to get away from their neighborhood in east Oakland - where gang shootings, robberies and murders are common - and go to nearby Alameda, a city on an island with beautiful homes, tree-lined streets and many parks.\n\nGonzalez stopped breathing in a park at the end of a cul-de-sac of well-kept homes with manicured gardens.\n\nThe video shows that one officer put an elbow on his neck and a knee on his shoulder, while another appeared to put a knee on his back and leave it there for about four minutes as Gonzalez gasped for air, saying, \"I didn't do nothing, OK?\"\n\nThe union representing Alameda police officers did not respond to a request for comment but Alison Berry Wilkinson, an attorney representing the officers, told KTVU in Oakland that they \"used the lowest degree of force possible given the intensity of Mr. Gonzalez's efforts to evade their grasp.\"\n\nGonzalez seemed intoxicated and disoriented and the officers were concerned he would fall, she said.\n\nOne officer put a knee on his back but only as a \"balance point,\" Wilkinson said.\n\n\"There was never a point in time where any officer's knee was on Mr. Gonzalez's neck. Nor was there a time when they were pressing down hard enough on his body to cause him not to breathe,\" Wilkinson said.\n\nAll three officers are on administrative leave. The city identified them Wednesday as Officer James Fisher, who has been with the Alameda Police Department since 2010, and Cameron Leahy and Eric McKinley who joined in 2018. The city said Civilian Parking Enforcement employee Charlie Clemmens was also involved.\n\nThe death is under investigation by the Alameda County Sheriff's Department, the district attorney's office and a former San Francisco city attorney hired by Alameda to lead an independent probe. All four have now been interviewed by both the sheriff's and district attorney's investigators, the city said.\n\nGonzalez died hours before the case against former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin went to the jury. The next day, Chauvin was convicted of murder and manslaughter for pinning Floyd to the pavement with his knee on the Black man's neck in a case that touched off a national reckoning over racism and police brutality.\n\nAs with Floyd, officers are routinely trained not to restrain people the way they did Gonzalez, said multiple use-of-force experts who viewed the video at the AP's request.\n\n\"Officers have been instructed to not keep handcuffed subjects prone (face-down) and to instead roll them onto their sides for going on 30 years,\" said Seth Stoughton, who teaches criminology and criminal justice at the University of South Carolina.\n\nIn this case, one officer recognized the danger, asking shortly before Gonzalez stopped breathing if they should roll him on his side. The other refuses, saying he doesn't want to lose his grip.\n\nThat was their fatal mistake, experts said.\n\n\"Once they're controlling him, as we learned from the Floyd trial with all those medical experts, this position or compression is deadly,\" said Geoffrey Alpert, a professor of criminology at the University of South Carolina and an expert on police use of force.\n\nMoreover, officers are trained to take particular care with those like Gonzalez who may be especially vulnerable because of their body weight, intoxication or other factors, said Ed Obayashi, a use-of-force consultant to law enforcement agencies and a deputy sheriff and legal adviser for the Plumas County, California, sheriff's office.\n\nGonzalez weighed about 250 pounds (113 kilograms), and police said he appeared to be under the influence.\n\n\"Here it's pretty obvious this individual is suffering from compression restraint asphyxia,\" Obayashi said. \"He's hyperventilating, he's obese, apparently he's been drinking ... Officers need to recognize those factors and take them into consideration.\"\n\nInterim Alameda Police Chief Randy Fenn told KTVU-TV said the video was \"troubling\" and offered his condolences to Gonzalez's family. But he urged people to withhold judgement pending the results of a full investigation into the death.\n\n\"We don't even know the cause of death right now,\" he said. \"\"Video only tells part of the story, so we need the entire investigation to understand whether or not the actions were legal, consistent with training and within policy.\"\n\nGonzalez had a 4-year-old son, also named Mario, and was the main caretaker of his brother, who has autism and turned 23 on Tuesday, his family said.\n\nGonzalez's mother, who lost another son two years ago, turned 45 on the day after Mario died, his brother said.\n\n\"It was just heartbreaking having to see my mother see the last moments of her firstborn, which is something that no mother wants to endure,\" Jerry Gonzalez said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Robert Jablon in Los Angeles contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP) - Scattered among the banners reading \"Black Lives Matter\" and \"No Justice, No Peace\" at Connecticut rallies against police brutality have been signs calling for \"Justice for Jay.\"\n\nJose \"Jay\" Soto was a 27-year-old Hispanic man shot to death by a SWAT team on April 2 as he left his mother's home in Manchester following a standoff that began when he refused to surrender to a parole officer. His family says he was not carrying a weapon and was putting his hands in the air when he was shot.\n\nAmid the protests spurred by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis , Soto's family and activists have called for more attention to his case and accountability for the officers involved.\n\nSoto was acting erratically and had threatened to shoot anyone who tried to take him out of his house, authorities said.\n\nSoto's stepfather, Anthony Vazquez, said the family told police there was no gun in the house. He said that they offered to talk to Soto and take him out to police but that the officers refused. The family told authorities he had mental illnesses, including post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n\"He's not a murderer. He's not bin Laden. He's just a confused boy. That's all,\" Vazquez said. \"Do you think this would have happened if he was white?\"\n\nAt the time, Soto was supposed to have been living in a halfway house while on parole for a 2013 robbery. He was listed by the Department of Correction as an parole absconder in October 2019. His family said he was at home isolating with them during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe standoff, which lasted several hours, began after a parole officer went to the house in Manchester and called the Capitol Region Emergency Services Team when Soto did not come out and made threats, police said.\n\nA video from a police cruiser shows the door swinging open but did not capture the shooting. The four officers who fired shots at Soto have been placed on administrative leave while the shooting is being investigated.\n\nIn April, the prosecutor investigating the shooting, Tolland State's Attorney Matthew Gedansky, issued a statement saying the preliminary investigation indicated that Soto \"manifested an intent to emerge from the residence in a manner which rejected the negotiator's advice to surrender peacefully.\"\n\nBishop John Selders, founding pastor of the Amistad United Church of Christ and leader of the social justice group Moral Monday CT, said Soto's death is part of a pattern that has seen Latinos killed by police.\n\n\"It's important to me in a Connecticut context that people understand that black and brown folk are at risk equally,\" said Selders, whose group is affiliated with the national Black Lives Matter network. \"White supremacy is the overall problem, with its action arm, racism. We all get caught in that net.\"\n\nSelders and other clerics are in the second week of a fast on the grounds of Connecticut's Capitol, demanding the governor call lawmakers into a special session to overhaul the state's criminal justice system, putting more money into social and mental health services.\n\nEach day, they mention Soto in their prayers, along with others killed by police. One of the issues Moral Mondays wants to see addressed is the amount of time it takes to investigate such shootings.\n\nInvestigations in Connecticut have taken months or years to complete before authorities decide whether charges are warranted.\n\n\"We know that prosecutors are capable of making decisions and filing charges quickly, because they do it all the time against regular people,\" said Kelly McConney Moore, the policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union of Connecticut. \"Their failure to do so against police when they commit acts of violence confirms that state's attorneys in Connecticut are complicit in a system designed to shield police from accountability.\"\n\nChief State's Attorney Richard Colangelo Jr. said there are new policies to speed up that process and require that a report be issued within 120 days of the completion of the police investigation. It's not clear when that investigation will be finished.\n\nColangelo said he would support a prosecutorial unit dedicated to the investigation of such shootings but not an independent board to oversee the probes. Prosecutors, he said, have the expertise to properly examine and weigh evidence.\n\n\"I'm looking at the facts as the investigation uncovers them, applying it to the law and making a determination if I can prove a charge beyond a reasonable doubt,\" he said. \"I've prosecuted police throughout my career. I've found that while we play on the same field, we don't get dressed in the same locker room.\"\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that it was a parole officer, not a probation officer, who went to the home of Soto's family.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "A Trump-Inspired Hate Crime in Boston\n\nOne of two men who allegedly beat a homeless Hispanic man cited the Republican presidential candidate's criticism of immigrants as a motivation. Latino leaders aren't surprised.\n\nThe impact of Donald Trump's anti-immigrant broadsides appears to have veered dangerously far off the presidential campaign trail.\n\nPolice in Boston say that one of two brothers who allegedly beat a homeless Hispanic man cited Trump's message on immigration as a motivation for their attack. \"Donald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported,\" Scott Leader, 38, told officers, according to a police report cited by The Boston Globe .\n\nLeader and his brother, Steve, were arrested and charged with multiple assault charges after police said they urinated on and then assaulted a 58-year-old homeless man they found sleeping outside a T-station as they walked home from a Red Sox game. They allegedly beat him with a metal pole, breaking his nose and causing other injuries. According to the Globe , Scott Leader told police it was OK to assault the man because he was Hispanic and homeless. Both men, who have extensive criminal records, pleaded not guilty and said the homeless man started the confrontation.\n\nOfficials in Boston immediately denounced the attack. But Trump, who has made no apology for suggesting some Mexican immigrants were \"rapists\" and calling for their mass deportation, appeared to brush off the incident when he was asked about it while campaigning Wednesday in New Hampshire. \"I think that would be a shame,\" he said, according to The Boston Herald , in reference to the report. He said he hadn't heard about the incident but then defended his most ardent supporters as \"passionate.\"\n\nI will say, the people that are following me are very passionate. They love this country. They want this country to be great again. But they are very passionate. I will say that.\n\nFor Latino leaders who repeatedly denounced Trump's rhetoric against undocumented immigrants, the most disturbing part of the attack in Boston was how unsurprising it was. \"It's a pattern that we have seen over the last decade in the nation with enforcement only policies and this anti-immigrant rhetoric,\" said Hector Sanchez, the chairman of the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda, in a phone interview, \"I was not surprised.\"\n\nSanchez said he has repeatedly warned that Trump's statements, which have been laughed off as clownish in some quarters, are taken far more seriously in the Latino community. \"When Trump is having this kind of anti-Latino and anti-immigrant language, he's not only a clown talking in general, his language has a direct impact in the quality of life of Latinos,\" he said. Sanchez said he believed that a 50 percent rise in hate crimes against Hispanics over the last five years is \"directly correlated\" to anti-immigrant rhetoric from conservatives. Before Trump's emergence in the last few months, inflammatory statements from Republican members of Congress like Steve King and Louie Gohmert made national headlines.\n\nFrank Sharry, the executive director of America's Voice, called Trump's response to the attack \"morally bankrupt.\"\n\nThis pattern of hateful rhetoric has officially passed the of point of extremist words and has turned into alarming action. This is more than just bad politics. When political debate encourages an atmosphere where hateful actions and hurtful rhetoric get mainstreamed, it's bad for the country.\n\nYet with Trump's rivals in the Republican field responding to his rise by running to the right on immigration, there seems to be little that Latino leaders can do beside denounce the party and promise retribution at the polls next year. \"Unfortunately, a lot of those extremist views are now reflective of the Republican Party,\" Sanchez said. Will the outrage of the hate-fueled attack in Boston prompt the GOP to take on Trump more directly? Perhaps. But if Trump's establishment-be-damned campaign strategy is a guide, it might not do much good."

      "text": "One Week Out, Angle Runs Racially Charged Ad\n\nWith one week until election day, Sharron Angle is running an immigration-focused ad that features many menacing photos of Latino men clutching weapons, getting patted down by the police, and posing for mug shots.\n\nThis ad is reminiscent of some other racially charged, down-to-the-wire spots we've seen before.\n\nPerhaps the best-known example of this is the Willie Horton ad from 1988, in which an independent group tied Michael Dukakis to a black convict who raped and killed a woman after escaping from a furlough program Dukakis supported. Horton's menacing mug shot, which the ad displayed, has become symbolic of racial fear-mongering in political campaigns.\n\nAnother iconic ad in this tradition is Jesse Helms' \"hands\" ad, which the North Carolina senator ran toward the end of his race against the former mayor of Charlotte, an African American man named Harvey Gantt. The ad features a white man's hands balling up a job rejection notice. \"You needed that job. And you were the best qualified. But they had to give it to a minority because of a racial quota,\" a narrator says. \"For racial quotas: Harvey Gantt. Against racial quotas: Jesse Helms.\" The ad is credited with helping Helms catch up to Gantt in the polls and win re-election.\n\nRace has already played a role in Angle's campaign. She's run a series of anti-illegal immigration ads and has drawn flak from Hispanics for some of them. While Angle was speaking at a Nevada high school, some Hispanic students questioned her about an ad pairing pictures of dark-skinned men with the phrase \"illegal aliens.\" Angle told the students that she didn't think the men in the ad were necessarily Latino, and that in fact the students themselves didn't look definitively Latino--\"some of you look a little more Asian to me,\" she added. Angle talked about the Canadian border, claiming that \"that's where the terrorists came through\"--an erroneous statement that Canada's ambassador asked Angle to retract.\n\nIn her latest immigration-themed ad, however, Angle clears up any confusion concerning which border she's worried about. The ad begins with flashes of an El Paso border station and images of burly Hispanic men holding guns. \"Waves of illegal aliens streaming across our border, joining violent gangs, forcing families to live in fear,\" a narrator says. Illustrating the fearful families is a white woman who looks down at a white man, presumably her husband, shielding his face in worry.\n\nThe narrator goes on to claim that Angle's opponent, Democratic Sen. Harry Reid, is voting to give illegal immigrants Social Security benefits, tax breaks, and college tuition. Contrasted with a mug shot of a young Hispanic man in a bandana is a classroom full of eager white children. \"Harry Reid: it's clear whose side he's on,\" the narrator says at the end of the ad. \"And it's not yours.\" This ad draws us vs. them, white vs. non-white lines far more explicitly than the Willie Horton or Jesse Helms ads did. It leaves no question about who Nevadan voters should fear. Angle's ad may join Horton and \"hands\" in racial messaging infamy, but both of those ads saw a political pay-off. Next week will tell us whether this messaging works in 2010, when directed at a state with a large illegal immigrant population and the highest unemployment rate in the country."

      "text": "A Memo to Donald Trump on His Greatest Failure\n\nThe billionaire candidate fails to do the least that a leader should to hedge against ethnic strife.\n\nTo: Donald Trump\n\nSubject: The Very Least a Leader Must Do\n\nDonald,\n\nPresidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush presented themselves as very different leaders, but like Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush before them, they understood and discharged at least one responsibility of their office: signaling that no racial or ethnic group should ever become an object of national demonization. For all the inexcusable civil-liberties abuses over which President Bush presided after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, many targeting Muslims and Muslim Americans, he acquitted himself admirably in the many public statements in which he made it clear that the overwhelming majority of Muslim Americans are peaceful, patriotic people who ought never to be harassed or harmed by bigots of any sort.\n\nPresident Obama, who has also transgressed inexcusably against the civil liberties of Americans, excels in that same way, and has always spoken about race in a responsible manner that emphasizes shared values, purposes, and humanity. For an older example of a political leader operating in this tradition, look at George H.W. Bush discussing illegal immigration in a debate with Ronald Reagan:\n\nThe point isn't his position, it's his insistence that, whatever one thinks about immigration policy, it concerns human beings, all of whom deserve dignity and compassion.\n\nAmerica's elites have never been models of noblesse oblige, but every president who has served in my lifetime felt a form of this responsibility, some because they were so little removed from the Japanese internment that Ronald Reagan apologized for in 1988. \"Here we admit a wrong,\" he declared after Congress passed a reparations bill. \"Here we reaffirm our commitment as a nation to equal justice under the law.\"\n\nTaking special care with regard to the most horrific way that populism can go wrong-that is not a lot to ask of a leader. Here's Senator John McCain recoiling in 2008 when one of his supporters, intending insult, called Barack Obama a secret Arab:\n\nIt's as simple as that-his words aren't even the point so much as the signal that he sent.\n\nSending it is a conservative act of caution.\n\nThat's how responsible leaders behave in a country where the civil liberties of many minority groups, including your own German ancestors, have in the past been abrogated; in a world where prosperous countries sometimes descend into civil war over ethnic strife; in the context of a recent history that includes Hutus stirred to brutal genocide by mass media; and in a present in which a white supremacist massacres black worshippers, ISIS declares religious minorities to be fair game for rape, and hate crimes abound, including one perpetrated by a couple of your supporters against a homeless Hispanic man.\n\nNo one expects America to descend into Balkan-style strife. That is partly because, during the modern era, even many of our worst leaders have learned enough from history to act responsibly at least in this one way .\n\nBut not you, Donald. You just don't get it. That was clear the moment you started exaggerating the crimes committed by Mexican immigrants. It was even clearer last week after your exchange with a New Hampshire voter. And it is perhaps clearest from your clueless response to the controversy, which continued through the weekend.\n\nYou remember that exchange from last week:\n\nVoter: We have a problem in this country. It's called Muslims. We know our current president is one.\n\nTrump: Right.\n\nVoter: You know he's not even an American.\n\nTrump: We need this question. This is the first question!\n\nVoter: But anyway, we have training camps brewing where they want to kill us. That's my question, when can we get rid of 'em?\n\nTrump: We're going to be looking at a lot of different things. A lot of people are saying that, and you know, a lot of people are saying bad things are happening out there. We're going to be looking at that and plenty of other things.\n\nThe appropriate response to a voter like that is simple enough. \"Sir, President Obama is not actually a Muslim. What's more, he is an American. There are no known terrorist training camps in the United States, and if one was discovered, the Obama Administration would aggressively shut it down. And there is never a time when the United States will get rid of American citizens with inalienable rights to life and liberty, nor would I want to get rid of Muslim Americans even if it was totally legal. They are my friends, neighbors, and business associates. Some put on uniforms and fight for this country. The overwhelming majority are law-abiding patriots.\"\n\nThat is what a responsible man would say.\n\nYou encouraged his paranoid delusions!\n\nLater, you defended yourself, saying, \"Am I morally obligated to defend the president every time somebody says something bad or controversial about him? I don't think so!\"\n\nNice try.\n\nYou're not generally obliged to defend President Obama. Your obligation, rather, is to refute rather than encourage bigotry or paranoia directed against ethnic minority groups on occasions when they're voiced right in front of your face with millions watching .\n\nThat is the bare minimum required of a statesman. A belated, pro-forma \" I love the Muslims \" doesn't cut it.\n\n\"This is the first time in my life,\" you continued, \"that I have caused controversy by NOT saying something.\" That is because you've always been a publicity hound real-estate developer and blowhard reality-television star. When you were operating in the same cultural space as The Real Housewives of Orange County and Jersey Shore , there wasn't any danger of your stirring up the worst kind of social conflict.\n\nNow you're heading a mass political movement as a charismatic populist.\n\nThe fact that you don't seem to grasp that anything else changed as a result, that you are aggressively clueless about the burdens of the job that you're seeking, discredits you.\n\nNow, a lot of the things that discredit you are no worse than what discredits most politicians. But this one thing is different. When you gain politically by demonizing ethnic groups, or by pandering to those who do, you go from arguably likable eccentric to villain. You go from having kids who think \"my dad's a bit embarrassing, but he means well\" to kids who'll feel ashamed of what you stirred up for years after you leave politics. Those are the best case scenarios. The worst-case scenario is remote, but horrific: that's where you're the careless fool who ends the legacy of mostly responsible behavior on this issue, loses control of the forces you're enabling, and watches in horror as your actions harm a lot of innocents.\n\nIs that going to happen?\n\nProbably not, but the fact that you seem willing to risk it for a few points of support in a political campaign makes you execrable in a way that many politicians aren't.\n\nAnd that is saying something.\n\nYou surround yourself with some sensible people outside politics. Ask George H. Ross and Carolyn Kepcher what they think of your conduct with regard to this issue.\n\nAsk your daughter, Ivanka. Consult a few risk-managers.\n\nAnd when they admonish you, change your behavior, if only so that your associates and family members don't have to be ashamed of it. Doing so doesn't require you to be dishonest, or politically correct, or to adopt any policy position anathema to you-it just requires you to refute a few poisonous, demonstrably false delusions. \"It's something I don't want to talk about,\" you told George Stephanopolous over the weekend. \"I want to talk about the vets and the military. I want to talk about jobs.\" You don't seem to understand that responsible presidents sometimes talk about things they'd rather not discuss, for the sake of the country.\n\nYou seem to lack that capacity. Why? Absent a change in behavior, your staffers (yes, I'm talking to you!) should consider whether their consciences compel them to resign.\n\nNo one should work to elevate a man who can't clear this lowest of bars."

      "text": "Occupy L.A.: This is What Civics Look Like\n\nThere's a boiling point in California and currently it's expressed in the 253 tents surrounding Los Angeles City Hall\n\nLOS ANGELES -- I had just taken the hour-long tour for those new to Occupy LA, a solidarity demonstration sparked by Occupy Wall Street in New York. My husband had been visiting the encampment, centered on the lawns around Los Angeles City Hall, in solidarity with me, snooping around the mini-gatherings that pepper the building's grounds.\n\n\"You have no idea what's going on here!\" he declared after finding me on the corner of Spring and Temple Streets listening to an elderly Hispanic man standing on a box telling a captive audience how the bank took his home.\n\n\"Civics,\" I answered.\n\n\"Then you do know what's going on here,\" he said.\n\nWell first off: there's a tour. There's nothing more inviting and informative than that. It's given primarily by Cheryl Aichele, a medical cannabis advocate who looks like the person you'd seek out at any event for answers; she's non-threatening, sincere and most importantly knowledgeable. When I first meet her she's in a large tent with a production company logo on it (this is how we roll in LA). It's like a reception area for a community center. There's a whiteboard with the schedule of a dozen or so committee meetings that day. They use words like \"outreach\" and \"liaison\" and combinations thereof for their committees (and sub-committees). There's an \"objective and demands\" box that a middle-aged man stuffs a letter into. A woman next to me is inquiring about the AA meetings. She's immediately paired up with a fellow 12-stepper within earshot. There are flyers and maps and notices. It's Day Seven of the encampment -- they have AA meetings.\n\n\"All of the problems we are facing are legal. They're laws. We need to pass the right laws,\" says my tour guide Aichele.\n\nThese are terrible anarchists.\n\nA few days ago some LAPD officers came by to donate bags of clothes; they're made available to anyone who needs them. The Occupiers offer free food, also provided by donors. There's a lending library and a first aid tent. I'm told the health department came the day before. They told everyone to wash their hands and not to eat melon, but Occupy LA generally passed inspection.\n\n\"In LA, disasters tend to bring us together,\" explains Professor Wendel Eckford, a historian with Los Angeles City College who's been coming down to the Occupation everyday after class.\n\nAnd it is a disaster: One of out of every five U.S. foreclosures this year was in California . The unemployment rate in Los Angeles is 13 percent. State budget crisis after city budget crisis has taken its toll.\n\nThere's a boiling point and currently it's expressed in the 253 tents surrounding City Hall. Its part Peoples Park, part low-budget film set and part civics crash course.\n\nDue to a city ordinance they can't sleep in the park surrounding City Hall. So every night all the tents move to the sidewalk and every morning they move back. They also recycle and have signs reading \"Zero waste station\" on all four corners of the park. I see a guy scrubbing a graffiti tag off of the wall of the landmark marble building. The group has a non-violence policy which includes graffiti. But their big concern: wheelchair access. It's a new goal to make the whole occupation accessible to those with disabilities.\n\n\"We'd like to be an example for other cites,\" says tour guide Aichele.\n\nAnd by \"cities\" she means Occupations. Which are growing in number everyday.\n\nLos Angeles City Council members make frequent visits to the tent city encompassing the building where they work. City Council President -- and soon-to-be mayoral candidate -- Eric Garcetti, who holds an annual Government 101 seminar at City Hall to help citizens make better use of the system, has been down at Occupy LA recruiting participants for next year's tutorial. Councilmembers Dennis Zine and Bill Rosendahl also are staunch supporters of the Occupation.\n\nBut it was Councilmember Richard Alarcon who was approached by one of his constituents, a member of the City Liaison Committee for Occupy LA, Mario Brito, to support this demonstration. Alarcon tells The Atlantic , \"[Occupy LA] is exhibiting the frustration of people throughout America.\"\n\nAlarcon's resulting City Council resolution in support of the demonstrators reads like an Occupy Wall Street manifesto: \"WHEREAS, the causes and consequences of the economic crisis are eroding the very social contract upon which the Constitution that the United States of America was founded; namely, the ability of Americans to come together and form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense of, promote the general welfare of, and secure the blessings of liberty for all, allowing every American to strive for and share in the prosperity of our nation through cooperation and hard work;.\" It's a three-page resolution mentioning Citizens United, foreclosures, wealth inequality, Egypt and corporate personhood.\n\n\"I've never written one that long before,\" says Alarcon.\n\nAlarcon's resolution was expected to pass Wednesday morning with a wide margin of support, giving the Occupiers the blessing of the council.\n\nSure, there are hippies dancing. And yes, there are drum circles. It's LA, so there's also \"medicinal\" marijuana wafting about. But mostly the crowd looks like LA: Half Latino, a quarter African-American and Asian and mostly middle-class. And that's who is in the meetings, not the hippies. In the meetings, people discuss things like Glass-Steagall, plans of actions and politicians to reach out to. There's a general sense that this is something big and they need to figure out what to do with it. All is reported at the General Assembly or GA every night at 7:30 p.m. Participants use Quaker consensus decision-making hand signals in all meetings. Participants can indicate if they agree, disagree, kind of agree or oppose vehemently -- all non-verbally. So speakers get to see the reaction of the crowd in real time. It's public polling and it's painfully slow and tedious. Meaning: this is what democracy looks like. Everyone has a voice and not all of them are poignant. Some of them are repetitive -- and there's a hand signal for that, too.\n\nWhat about being on message? At the encampment, there are communists next to Ron Paul supporters next to vegan activists next to those LaRouche people (who always seem to show up) -- even a couple of union guys. I've always called this liberal \"micro-cause-ism.\" Will they stay on point? \"We're not focused on the thing that's not causing the problem,\" says Aichele. Message cohesion is not the rigged system they're rallying to change.\n\nThe cumbersome process and cacophany of messages is all about honoring the First Amendment to them. Everyone gets to be heard regardless of someone else's opinion. As long as you're the \"99 percent\" -- which the vast majority of are -- and are respectful and peaceful, you're welcome at Occupy LA.\n\nWhat are they doing there? Teaching people who are angry what to do about it. \"The sense of building something together -- that experience is empowering,\" offers Aichele. They are occupying, yeah, but they are organizing. And that means teaching.\n\nEckford tells me Occupy LA isn't leaderless -- it's \"leaderful.\" When asked when this demonstration will end, he says, \"When we feel like our democracy is working for the 99 percent.\"\n\nHow are they going to do that? This is how it starts.\n\nLA Democratic Congresswoman Karen Bass, who describes herself as a long time activist, quietly showed up with bags of El Pollo Loco for protesters last Saturday. \"I just wanted to show my support.\" She says the role of elected officials is to show their support for this movement she describes as organic.\n\nLocal civic leaders, union leaders, police, councilmembers, a couple of celebrities and members of Congress have all made their cameos at Occupy LA. It's a hotspot.\n\nOther cities have run into conflicts with the police. Occupy San Francisco had its demonstration quashed by police in riot gear. There were 700 arrested in New York on the Brooklyn Bridge. Boston's occupation led to the biggest mass arrest in recent city history. LA? There were arrests at a Bank of America and at a Fannie Mae, it was rumored to be Occupy LA members. However the actual groups involved were the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment and the Service Employees International Union. Beyond a few who have tried intentionally to incite something, the LA protest has been peaceful and kid-friendly. Most importantly, it's been effective.\n\nHow long is it going to be out there? I ask around. They are in it for the long haul, protesters say. \"We're not going fast, we're going far,\" is a phrase they use. The time between the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and the ratification of the Constitution in 1788 gets mentioned.\n\nI ask my tour guide how long she's going to be out here. She pauses: \"I don't know. I've never revolutionized before.\"\n\nImage credit: REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson"

His tax proposals make George W. Bush look fiscally prudent . He acts as if America can use sanctions, war, or the threat of war to bludgeon its adversaries into submission despite the devastating failure of that approach since 9/11. He has been dishonest and gutless on immigration . He has flirted with climate-change denial even though his hometown now regularly floods.\n\nStill, if I lived in any of the nine Super Tuesday states that allow non-Republicans to vote in their GOP presidential primary, I would cross over-forfeiting my chance to cast a ballot for Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders-and vote for Rubio. Other liberals should do the same. Those who can should write him checks. Whatever it takes to stop the nomination of Donald Trump.\n\nThere are three arguments against what I'm proposing.\n\n1. Argument number one is that, from a liberal perspective, Rubio is not the best candidate in the GOP field. John Kasich is. That's true, but as a vehicle for stopping Trump, Kasich is useless. He has barely any money and barely any campaign infrastructure. He's only seriously competing in his home state. At this point in the race, only one Republican has the combination of elite and mass support necessary to have even a sliver of a chance of defeating Trump. And it's Rubio.\n\n2. Argument number two is that Rubio's not much better than Trump. On some issues, in fact, he's worse. Unlike Trump, Rubio does not challenge the logic underlying the Iraq War. Nor will he call America's campaign-finance system corrupt.\n\nBut as important as these issues are, there's a more fundamental difference between the two candidates. Rubio respects the Constitution, and in particular, the Bill of Rights. Trump does not. Trump does not threaten American democracy. He is not trying to deny Americans the right to choose their leaders. But he does threaten American liberal democracy, the idea that there are certain rights so fundamental that even democratic majorities cannot undo them. Trump is not subverting public opinion. He's exploiting and fomenting its basest aspects. In deciding how much to appeal to the public's most hateful and bloodthirsty desires, most politicians exercise a measure of restraint born in part from a respect for legal norms and individual rights. Trump calls this restraint \"political correctness\" and flaunts his disdain.\n\nI doubt Trump is the first post-9/11 presidential candidate to realize he could rouse a majority of Americans-or at least a majority of Republicans-by calling for the murder of terrorists' family members and by giving a full-throated endorsement of torture. But the others stopped short. Other Republican presidential candidates have demonized Muslims, but none ever called for banning every single Muslim from entering the country. Other prominent Republicans subtly questioned President Obama's Americanism. Trump denied he was born in the United States.\n\nThe difference is shame. It's vaguely possible to imagine another Republican candidate launching the canard about Muslims celebrating 9/11. But only Trump-despite a thousand fact checks proving him wrong-would double down on the claim. Other Republicans have played on the right's hatred of the mainstream press . But only Trump calls for changing libel laws to make it harder for journalists to write critical stories about him. And only Trump openly threatens the donors who fund efforts to defeat his campaign.\n\nIt's no coincidence that Trump has praised Vladimir Putin. Although Trump probably couldn't get away with everything the Russian leader has done, a Trump presidency could move the United States in the direction of what Fareed Zakaria calls \"illiberal democracy.\" Americans would still elect their presidents, but those presidents, once chosen, would face fewer restraints on their power and be free to more severely curtail the rights of targeted groups. Many of those restraints, after all, are a matter of convention. We can't know how robust they are until someone challenges them. Trump will challenge them in ways Rubio will not.\n\n3. The third argument against liberals supporting Rubio is that America will benefit if Trump destroys the Republican Party. If the GOP splits, or loses massively this fall, then perhaps moderates will regain influence and the Republican Party-or whatever supplants it-will stop denying climate change, stop refusing to vote on judges, and stop pushing the United States to the brink of financial default. Maybe as a result of Trump, the party's \" fever may break .\"\n\nI understand the argument's allure, but it's reckless. Although it's highly likely Trump would lose a general election, there are no guarantees. Hillary Clinton could be indicted. Terrorists could strike two days before Americans head out to vote. If nothing else, the course of the presidential race so far should instill a healthy modesty in anyone inclined to make blanket assertions about what will happen in six months.\n\nBut we do know this: Once Trump is nominated, America will have crossed a line.\n\nA man who does not respect constitutional limits and who preys upon vulnerable minorities will lead one of the two major parties. The consequences, though hard to measure, could be profound. A few days ago in Iowa, fans at a high-school basketball game chanted , \"Trump,\" at the opposing team, which comprised Latino, African American, and Native American players. They wielded the name of the man who could become president as a racial slur. Protesters at Trump's rallies have been beaten . Last year, in Boston, two men beat a Hispanic man with a metal pipe while yelling , \"Trump was right.\" Just imagine what might happen if were Trump nominated or, God forbid, elected. In myriad ways, America would become an uglier, scarier place.\n\nIf Rubio won, by contrast, the Republican Party might be stabilized. The terms of debate between the two parties would remain roughly the same. Given how radical even \"establishment\" Republicans like Rubio actually are, that's a depressing prospect.\n\nNominating Trump would upend all that. American politics would fundamentally change. But as conservatives have often reminded liberals, change does not equal progress. Sometimes even a morally corrupt status quo is better than what follows. A Trump nomination would represent a leap into a terrifying political unknown.\n\nLiberals should try to forestall it by backing Marco Rubio. And if we fail, we should implore conservatives to help stop Trump by backing Hillary Clinton. Although the polarization in American politics today is vast, there are still norms that both decent liberals and decent conservatives cherish, and do not wish to see smashed. Across the ideological divide, it's time to close ranks."

      "text": "Rubio: I'm Not Sure We're Better Off Than We Were Under Trump\n\nThe Florida senator isn't convinced that the current administration is doing better than the last.\n\nDespite the whirlwind in Washington this week, Marco Rubio isn't worried-at least not for his own party. As of now, Democrats have reached a deal to stave off a government shutdown until December, but they still need to prevent another crisis: a first-ever default on the national debt. Rubio is among the Senate Republicans who blocked efforts to raise the debt ceiling, effectively forcing Democrats to make the move on their own. \"If you're going to make a decision to ram your agenda down our throat, then you're going to have to do the debt limit by yourself as well,\" the Florida Republican told Kelly O'Donnell, a White House correspondent for NBC News.\n\nIn Rubio's eyes, the Democrats are trying to \"radically transform the role of government in our country\"-something he doesn't believe they have a mandate to do. He's also not sure that the nation is in a better place than under the previous administration, accusing President Joe Biden's government of mishandling the pandemic, the border, and the Afghanistan withdrawal.\n\nRubio spoke with O'Donnell during The Atlantic Festival today. Their conversation has been edited lightly for length and clarity.\n\nKelly O'Donnell: We're coming together on a day that is not just an ordinary day in Washington. It's the end of the fiscal year for the federal government. There's a lot happening on Capitol Hill. Do you expect that the issue of simply keeping the government open, government funding, will that be resolved before the deadline?\n\nMarco Rubio: I think so, and it could have been resolved a month ago, a week ago. I think it will be resolved today. I'm not sure. I don't know anyone here who is in favor of the government shutting down. The debates have been about issues attached to it, not to the actual issue of funding the government. So I-if I were to-we're going to vote it out of the Senate today. And I imagine the House will take it up and send it over to the president before midnight.\n\nO'Donnell: That's a good thing that we can take that off the list of many things that are sort of crashing together at the same time on Capitol Hill. What is your view about your own responsibility as a senator representing Florida when it comes to the debt ceiling? There is a lot of debate about this being a bipartisan issue. Republicans like yourself have said, no, Democrats need to do this on their own. Why do you hold that view?\n\nRead: Marco Rubio makes his move\n\nRubio: The cost [of the reconciliation bill] is significantly higher than $3.5 trillion. And they've known the whole time. Look, if you're going to do $3.5 trillion spending all by yourselves, we're going to have no input into the size of it, or what it's on-if that's what you're going to do, then you can do the debt limit by yourself as well. And that's a position that we took very early. They've known that for months. You can't say, \"We want you to help us raise the debt limit, but together. But when it comes to spending the money, we're going to do it by ourselves and we're going to decide how money is spent.\" It doesn't work that way. It's certainly not going to work for us here. And so we've told them that for months; they've known it. So the reason why we're reaching this deadline with so much uncertainty is because they either didn't take it seriously or didn't care.\n\nO'Donnell: Even though the debt ceiling is about past spending, not the 3.5 trillion or whatever number they finally settle on for infrastructure, climate, and other programs?\n\nRubio: Well, that would be a more legitimate argument for them to make if this was about the status quo. But it's not about the status quo. They want to raise the debt limit because it allows them to spend even more. And they know they're going to have to borrow money to do it. The debt limit, by and large, is something that should be worked out. I don't think anyone wants the nation to default. But if you're going to make a decision to ram your agenda down our throat with 51 votes, you have no input on it. You're going to have no say on it, then you're going to have to do the debt limit by yourself as well. If they were really interested in working this out, then they would have worked with us on a budget agreement. They would have allowed us to have input on the budget agreement. We don't own the budget agreement, because they didn't allow us to have any input on it, and they passed.\n\nO'Donnell: So, Senator, is the debt limit a political tool, in your judgment?\n\nRubio: I think it's a commonsense conclusion. Look, in Congress they have a decision to make about how they're going to run the institution. One way, you can say, is \"Okay, we're 50-50 in the Senate; we need a vice president to break a bunch of ties. And so 50 Republicans are going to have to have some input into the things we do.\" [Democrats have] chosen not to do it that way. What they've chosen to do is to say, \"We have an agenda; we're going to pursue this agenda; and we're going to run you over with this agenda.\" So if you make that decision, you can't then come back and say to that minority, and in the case here, the 50 Republicans, \"We want you to be a part of it.\"\n\nO'Donnell: Turning to Afghanistan, you have been outspoken on your views. We've now had a chance to hear from Secretary [Lloyd] Austin, General [Mark] Milley, and General [Kenneth] McKenzie. You had previously called for General Milley to step down based on some of the reporting coming out about his conversations with China during the end of the Trump administration. Have your views on the status of General Milley changed at all now that you've heard that he cleared that call, that he briefed his superiors about that and so forth?\n\nRubio: No, they haven't. After that hearing, we know for a fact that he was now the source. Not only that, but he's talked to multiple reporters. I don't know of any other chairman of the Joint Chiefs that has spent that much time talking to reporters about books regarding the previous administration. This is not a former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman. This is the current and acting one. And it really begins to inject military and military officials into a place that is very dangerous for them to be. And so I can reach only two conclusions: Either (a) this was nothing but a normal call to the Chinese and him exaggerating to these reporters, or (b) him actually undermining the chain of command because he decided that the direction the president was going was dangerous. It's one of those two. And neither one of them is good. And I don't think that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs should be a position that is this politicized. We shouldn't be talking about him in these things that much. And the reason why we are? It's because he decided to sit there and give these lengthy interviews on background, by the way, not just to Bob Woodward and Robert Costa but apparently multiple other reporters working on books as well.\n\nO'Donnell: I'm going to move along to politics. You will be a candidate for reelection on the ballot next year. You're in the national conversation. What role do you think President Trump has in the Republican Party today, and going forward?\n\nDavid Frum: There is no defense-only complicity\n\nRubio: Donald Trump is the most popular, most widely supported, most influential Republican in the country. That itself is explanatory about what role he can play and is going to play. What role he wants to play is up to him to decide. But you can't have someone who's the most popular, the most well known, and the most influential Republican not be a factor in these races. There are a lot of people out there, including in my party, that strongly support the president, because even though they don't agree with him on every issue, they view him as someone who was willing to fight, someone who was willing to take the slings and arrows of those who are unfair in the coverage of the conservative movement. I also think that in retrospect, some of the disasters we've seen over the last six to eight weeks in the current administration have allowed people to draw a point of comparison. You look at the migratory crisis at the border, the withdrawal from Afghanistan, a series of things, and you say to yourself, Donald Trump tweeted things I didn't agree with or did-said-this or said that, but we didn't have that sort of policy chaos that we're now seeing in place after place under the current administration . But to answer your question, I think Donald Trump is the most influential and popular Republican in the country right now. Public polling says it. Common sense tells me that.\n\nO'Donnell: And is he using that influence, Senator, in a way that you think is constructive: the way he talks about January 6, the way he talks about the election that he lost to Joe Biden, the way he talks about COVID? Is he using that influence to help the country? He does not espouse vaccinations beyond acknowledging he got vaccinated. He has many followers who have not sought vaccination. He talks about the insurrection and the events on January 6 as if that didn't happen. Is he using that influence in a way that you think is good for the country?\n\nRubio: He certainly has strong opinions, and he's giving those strong opinions. And some people agree with him and some people don't.\n\nO'Donnell: Do you?\n\nRubio: I believe people should be vaccinated, for example. I've been vaccinated. I've repeatedly said I think people should be vaccinated. What I don't believe is that I or any other government official should have the power to force people to get vaccinated. And I think it's ironic that we are in a country where a Border Patrol agent who is unvaccinated can be fired, but someone who migrates here illegally from another country can enter the country without being vaccinated and is released into the general population. Americans are being fired from their jobs, but foreigners can enter the country illegally and not be vaccinated. That's an absurd outcome.\n\nO'Donnell: In your home state right now, the case count is going down after a very, very difficult period. In the last week, it has dropped in terms of COVID-positive cases. But Florida remains in the top 10 for the rate of death. Is there more that you or other Republican officeholders could do to encourage vaccination? You don't blink about saying you've been vaccinated and you believe in vaccinations, but is there something more you could do to try to get those who have not gotten vaccinated to be open to that?\n\nRubio: I don't know how else we can encourage more vaccination other than to tell people it's safe and effective and they should be vaccinated. But there's a difference between encouraging vaccination, which I don't think anyone disagrees with, and certainly I don't, and mandating it and telling people \"We're going to fire you if you don't.\" At the end of the day, there is something called personal responsibility in this country. I wish people exercised more. I wish people would lose weight. I wish people would monitor their blood sugar so they don't have a diabetic episode that can cost them their lives down the road. But just because we think that's the right thing for people to do, there are some things we can't force people to do. I personally know people that haven't been vaccinated, and because I care about it, it frustrates me. But I have to separate that from the idea that I'm going to try to punish, persecute, stigmatize them, because in many cases that becomes highly counterproductive. I'm not sure why there is this hysteria about forcing people to get vaccinated. And I think practically it doesn't work. It becomes counterproductive, and it creates an additional irritant in an already deeply divided country.\n\nRead: Marco Rubio's lonely fight\n\nO'Donnell: And do you think politics has hardened people's choices, where there are some who believe they're in one tribe that says \"We don't like mandates; therefore I'm not going to get vaccinated\"? Do you think that kind of conversation has actually made it more difficult to get people to that choice of protecting themselves, their family, their loved ones?\n\nRubio: I'm giving you an opinion that's anecdotal, but I know people that may get vaccinated at some point, but they don't want to be told they have to be and almost react negatively to being told they have to be vaccinated. It's a strange situation, because I believe people should be vaccinated. On the other hand, I hear so many stories about people that are about to lose their jobs unless they allow someone to stick a needle in their arm, not once but twice, and put something into their body that's only a year and a half old. I don't agree with them; I have to respect that point of view. And for me to try to bash them over the head is only going to create a point of friction that makes it harder to find cooperation on a bunch of other things as well.\n\nO'Donnell: You're going into another election season. There's been so much focus on the past election, where the country stands on election security, on people's belief and their faith in the process. Do you think damage has been done to the public in Florida and elsewhere, [to their] believing that our elections work and that the outcomes are in fact valid?\n\nRubio: Yeah, and it's a long time building. I have a lot of experience in this issue, being from Florida. I was in the Florida legislature. My first year there was right after the 2000 election, where there were people that openly argued that George W. Bush was not a legitimate president because of what happened in the state of Florida. I come from a community in Miami where we've had a long history, unfortunately, of all sorts of electoral problems that forced us to change state laws. There was a time in Miami, Florida, where we had Republican operatives and Democrat operatives that were collecting and harvesting ballots at senior centers. And there were court cases about how some of the ballots were tampered with or thrown away, and things of that nature. So we passed laws to fix all of that.\n\nThere are two things that are important about elections. The first is that the results be accurate, and the other is that there be public confidence. And it doesn't take much for people to lose public confidence in an election's legitimacy, even if it's only 10 examples, and the margin of victory was 10,000 votes. That's all it takes, especially in this environment, and especially with foreign operatives driving some of this misinformation, to undermine public confidence in elections. So that's why election-integrity laws are so critical and why they need to be in place. And I don't think it helps anyone to go around equating requiring an ID or putting a limit on the deadline for when you can register, when the ballot has to be in, to Jim Crow-era laws. I think that is frankly absurd and offensive. I'm a Hispanic man. I am perfectly capable of producing an ID in order to go vote, just like I have to in order to get on an airplane or cash a check or do a bunch of other things. We can require people to prove they're vaccinated with a card. I don't think it's too much to ask.\n\nO'Donnell: Do you have any concerns as a candidate for reelection that your election will in fact be valid and the public should trust the results?\n\nRubio: No. Florida has great election laws and great election systems. In 2018, we had two counties that had very serious problems on how they administer those elections. And, frankly, one of the problems was a ballot-design problem, which may have cost Democrats thousands of votes and very close races. By and large, Florida has a very good election system. It's been improved even now, with new laws. And I think the reason why we have such a good election system is because we've had such a history of close elections, and obviously, in the case of the 2000 election, one that became the center of national attention for a period of time.\n\nO'Donnell: I first met you after your election to the Senate in 2010. That was a year of the Tea Party energy in the Republican Party. We've seen your home state vote for Barack Obama and then vote for Donald Trump in successive elections. We saw the momentum of how Donald Trump changed the party. As you go into 2022, what will define the energy and the atmosphere of what this election will be remembered for?\n\nRubio: We can never predict something that's going to happen. A pandemic couldn't have been predicted at this scale and nature. And we hope not to have international crises, but those things are always possible. But a couple of things are on the horizon. Inflation is going to be a big issue. I'm not sure people realize yet how much more expensive retail products are going to be very soon. The cost of producing things that are on their way are substantially higher, 20 to 25 percent higher than they were just a few months ago. And that's going to be reflected when people go Christmas shopping this year and into the new year. The other issue is that Democrats today had a three-vote majority in the House. They have a 50-50 Senate and a narrow victory in the presidency. And yet they're governing like they got a mandate to radically transform the role of government in our country. That's sort of out of touch with reality. And I think some of the incompetence of the current administration-I think the border situation is going to get far worse. There are between 90,000 and 120,000 migrants from Haiti alone that are all desiring to come towards the United States. And right now, the Biden administration is doing very little about it. There are multiple other countries as well that are contributing to this. So we've got a border crisis. We have inflation. And I hope I'm wrong, but I do think that we are going to see a counterterrorism threat emerge from Afghanistan at some point in the near future as well. And on a broader perspective, I would just say that we are living through a time of extraordinary economic, social, and geopolitical transformation, and public policy is struggling to keep up."

      "text": "How Communication and Education Can Help Solve Deepening Inequity and Distrust in Healthcare\n\n\"Our goal was to identify how and why some patients lack access to timely, relevant, and sustainable care. The findings, no surprise, are sobering.\"\n\nInequities in the healthcare system are deepening. A concurrent crisis of distrust is growing. And while patients and providers alike want change, solutions to both problems will require deep and fundamental disruption of the status quo.\n\nSuch were the major takeaways from a roundtable discussion of healthcare inequities at The 2021 Atlantic Festival, a seven-day, all-digital event convening prominent voices from politics, business, science, technology, and culture to explore ideas for building a better future.\n\nFeaturing healthcare experts and leaders from across the country, the discussion was underwritten by Genentech and touched on findings from the company's 2021 Health Equity study.\n\nA national online survey of 2,200 patients-more than half identifying as medically disenfranchised and as Black, Hispanic/Latinx, LGBTQ+, or of low socioeconomic status-as well as roughly 400 physicians, nurses, pharmacists, or physician assistants, the Genentech study found that:\n\n\"Our goal was to identify how and why some patients lack access to timely, relevant, and sustainable care,\" said Genentech Chief Executive Officer Alexander Hardy. \"The findings, no surprise, are sobering.\"\n\nThe study's results proved very relevant to the lively, 90-minute conversation that more deeply diagnosed the problems-and prescribed needed solutions rooted in education and communication:\n\n\"What if I had cancer?' And the healthcare system is going to treat me, when I am at my lowest moment, like that ... they just told me I didn't matter.\"\n\nIn December of 2020, Quita Highsmith was asked to participate in a COVID-19 clinical trial. At first, she was excited. As a Black woman and the chief diversity officer at Genentech, she knew that patients of color too often are underrepresented in research and otherwise marginalized by the healthcare system.\n\nThen came a Zoom call with one of the study's investigators. \"This Hispanic man wanted to ask a question, and the investigator was so disrespectful and rude,\" Highsmith said. A few weeks later, Highsmith received a call from a trial coordinator who told her that her participation was no longer wanted, because \"the sponsor has decided to de-prioritize Blacks.\"\n\n\"Literally, they said that,\" Highsmith says. \"It's still in my head ... and I just think, 'What if I had cancer?' And the healthcare system is going to treat me, when I am at my lowest moment, like that ... they just told me I didn't matter.\"\n\nHighsmith's story is not unique. People of color and other medically disenfranchised groups long have received lesser care, rooted in what Jack Resneck, President-Elect of the American Medical Association, calls \"historic systemic racism, the historic mistreatment that we've seen. The evidence goes all the way back to unethical experiments on slaves, to Tuskegee , to experiments on prisoners , to more recent evidence. And the contemporary lived experience of our patients who come in and feel that they are not treated the same -and where we have increasing evidence that's the case.\"\n\nRoundtable participants agreed that the pandemic has made these inequities more pronounced. A recent study found that in 2020, Black, Latino, and Native American deaths related to COVID-19 were \"at least 2 times higher\" than those of their white counterparts, and people in those groups also died at higher rates than white patients because of medical conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and Alzheimer's.\n\nThe study also concluded that structural factors ranging from racism to less access to healthcare to chronically underfunded care facilities contributed to disparate outcomes for communities of color.\n\n\"Deeply entrenched inequities in healthcare are impeding our ability to deliver for all patients,\" Hardy said. \"Clinical trial results that don't reflect real world demographics aren't always applicable to the patient groups most in need. Medical advances that don't reach everyone are simply not as impactful as they could or should be. Now as the science and technology moves forward, it's absolutely unacceptable that so many people are being left behind.\"\n\nGrowing distrust is compounding these inequities. During the work and school closures and other public health measures taken in the spring of 2020 to slow the spread of the coronavirus, Mohamed Younis, the Editor-in-Chief of Gallup News, noticed an unusual trend in his company's public opinion polls, which track and measure people's attitudes toward the American healthcare system.\n\n\"Americans were slightly impressed at the peak of the lockdown with healthcare providers and the healthcare system,\" he said. \"Particularly the people involved in healthcare.\" This was the time of hailing frontline healthcare workers as heroes-and of people in New York City applauding those workers every evening.\n\n\"But that [sentiment] has really crumbled this year ,\" Younis said. \"It has really come down significantly.\"\n\nYounis attributes this decline not only to the ongoing health challenges and controversies created by the pandemic, but also preexisting health equity gaps with geographic, socioeconomic, and racial dimensions. \"The public has become more perceptive of widespread discrimination against Black people . This year, we found in a national poll of Black adults that about one in six Black Americans report having experienced mistreatment in a healthcare setting in the past month.\"\n\nAmelia Burke-Garcia, a public health communicator and Director of Digital Strategies & Outreach, Public Health, NORC at the University of Chicago, sees similar patterns in her own research, which focuses on social media and behavior. \"Patient trust in the healthcare system and in providers is lower amongst communities of color and other marginalized populations, like LGBTQIA,\" she said. \"That has also decreased during the pandemic.\"\n\nThe Genentech national survey found that the vast majority of providers reported feeling that they are sensitive to the needs and emotions of patients. By contrast, more than half of disenfranchised patents reported not feeling understood by their providers.\n\nBurke-Garcia noted other NORC work that has uncovered parallel disconnects. \"Providers recognize the need to build trust with their patients,\" she said. \"But patients still feel that trust-building behaviors-such as time spent with them, whether they're perceived as listening to them, if they make eye contact with their patients-those trust-building behaviors actually are still lacking.\"\n\nWithout trust between providers and patients, panelists said, the communication and cooperation that is essential to quality care suffers. Misinformation has been a major problem during the pandemic, with conspiracy theories, rumors and misleading news reports spread via social media contributing to lagging coronavirus vaccination rates in Black and Hispanic communities.\n\nAccording to the Genentech survey, 47 percent of medically disenfranchised patients don't ask questions of their providers because they are afraid of looking unintelligent. Meanwhile, the overwhelming majority of providers (90 percent) have witnessed their own patients stopping care.\n\n\"We have to invest in the conversations, not just for physicians and patients, but also with public health advocates, and community-based activists, community health workers, nurses,\" says Winston Wong, a Scholar in Residence at the UCLA Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Equity. \"These are the trusted individuals that actually are organic to the communities. And we have not had enough discussion around our healthcare system, investing in non-physician messengers, and conduits for building the trust between the public at-large and communities that have been marginalized.\"\n\nWhen Genentech started the EMPACTA trial for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia with one of their medicines, the company ran into a problem while trying to reach traditionally underserved minority patients.\n\n\"It was very difficult to initially enroll patients,\" said Jamie Freedman, Head of U.S. Medical Affairs at Genentech.\n\n\"It started with just the consent, getting [patients] in the trial. But what we also heard from patients is, once the trial's over, they don't want us to leave the community-because you lose the trust. You have to continuously build trust over time.\"\n\nTo find enrollees, Freedman said, the company went to a number of undeserved, community-based hospitals. \"But that wasn't good enough,\" he said. What we learned is the most significant factor to be able to get those patients is the person consenting the patient should be the same race, and that will lead to much greater trust.\"\n\nEventually, Highsmith said, the study reached 85 percent enrollment from communities of color.\n\n\"Building trust is going to take a long time,\" he said. \"It started with just the consent, getting [patients] in the trial. But what we also heard from patients is, once the trial's over, they don't want us to leave the community-because you lose the trust. You have to continuously build trust over time. It's not like you can do one thing, and then all of a sudden you build trust.\"\n\nPanelists agreed that building equity and trust in the healthcare system will require improving communication and relationships between patients and providers-something that is particularly important in communities of color, where many patients feel dismissed and disregarded, often for reasons that go far beyond their experiences with doctors or medicine.\n\n\"The American government had a 100-year policy of removing our children forcibly from our homes and saying, 'kill the Indian, save the man ,'\" said Stacy A. Bohlen, the Chief Executive Officer of the National Indian Health Board and a citizen of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians. \"How do you recover from that? How are people healing from that? When this pandemic came along, we're already struggling with a treaty-promised healthcare system that is funded at 40 percent of need.\"\n\nLike Wong, many of the panelists recommended a more collaborative approach to patient-provider relationships-one in which providers see patients and community members as experts in their own experiences, listen to and respect their voices and points of view, and work with them to co-create their care.\n\n\"We always start this conversation from the point of view of the provider of the healthcare system\" said Gwen Darien, Executive Vice President of Patient Advocacy and Engagement for the National Patient Advocate Foundation. \"We don't turn the lens and look at it from the perspective of patients and families and communities. If the healthcare system doesn't trust the patients that it serves, patients are never going to trust the healthcare system. I think that is where we have to start. Nothing's going to change until we start with turning the lens around.\"\n\nTo help turn the lens around, Resneck said, the healthcare system must become more representative. That means recruiting and training more physicians of color-and investing more resources into hospitals and other providers that serve communities of color.\n\n\"Less than 12 percent of physicians are from underrepresented minorities\" he said. \"That's more than 30 percent of our population of patients who are not seeing a healthcare workforce that in any way reflects who they are.\"\n\nFreedman agreed. In Native American communities, he said, \"a lot of the patients are treated on reservations. And then if they need more advanced care, they need to be referred to hub centers or larger academic centers. But those centers, we've heard, are not culturally sensitive. And there's not a lot of Native American healthcare workers in the larger hospitals. So are there things that we should be doing about that as well, to help train more Native Americans to be physicians?\"\n\nTo fund education and training for more physicians and other providers of color, Bohlen suggested rethinking taxes on student loans, creating more scholarships for students of color, and considering diversity mandates as part of the funding requirements for medical education and residency programs.\n\n\"The MED program at the University of North Dakota requires a certain number of seats to be filled by an American Indian or Alaska native,\" she said. \"They're fully funded by the federal government, and if they're not filled by an American Indian or Alaska Native, they go unfilled, unpaid, undone. That's a pretty strong incentive to fill those seats with qualified American Indian and Alaska Native people.\"\n\nThroughout the conversation, panelists agreed that a crucial first step to building trust is acknowledging, understanding, and teaching others about the history of marginalized communities and their experience with the medical system.\n\n\"Part of the way that we rebuild trust is that patients need to see us in all parts of healthcare struggling with and reckoning with our own histories-and fostering those pathways for trust and healing,\" Resneck said. \"I think that there is a short-term effect of maybe as people learn about those histories, they distrust us even more. But it is a critical part of the pathway to longer trust development [for patients to see] that we are reckoning with it.\"\n\nMany panelists said that in order to reckon with healthcare's long history of racism and marginalization of communities of color, medical education needs to be revamped. \"[In medical school] I wasn't given the skills to address inequities in my community,\" Resneck said. \"If we are depending on a few [Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion] sessions to fix decades of what formed who people are, then that's an unrealistic expectation. We have to go upstream.\"\n\nSimilarly, Joy Lewis, the Senior Vice President of Health Equity Strategies at the American Hospital Association, said that a rethink of current cultural competency training may be in order. \"\"We've actually stepped away from using the term 'cultural competency,' and we now talk about rendering care with 'cultural humility,'\" she said. \"I think it actually is not possible to become culturally competent in someone else's culture ... it's, 'how do you approach each patient encounter with a level of respect with the level of empowering that patient to actually show up in their own lives?'\"\n\nUltimately, panelists said, building equity and trust will increase empathy and respect between providers and patients-which, in turn, will improve care for marginalized individuals and communities. One panelist offered a simple and personal rule of thumb for providers: Treat all your patients as if they were your mother or father, or someone you love deeply.\n\n\"There are researchers who are trying their best to diversify their trials, their studies,\" she said. \"But when you talk to the people who have been through the trial, they're not happy. And there's been some [studies showing] that a large percentage will never do it again, because they don't feel like they were treated respectfully and with dignity in the trial once they got in.\"\n\nGeorges Benjamin, the Executive Director of the American Public Health Association, can relate. A longtime doctor who also is African American, he remembers visiting with other healthcare providers, sometimes as a patient. \"They would say something to me which was demeaning,\" he said. \"I would point to their license on the wall, so they can see my signature-since I was the health secretary on their medical license.\"\n\nUltimately, Benjamin said, distrust and inequities within the healthcare system reflect the larger world outside of it-and that addressing one means addressing the other.\n\n\"We've all had those experiences, where we've not been treated with respect,\"  he said. \"And I think, fundamentally, we have to make sure that we recognize that with the health system, we can't fix it without thinking much more broadly about how we fix our society.\"\n\nThis content is made possible by our sponsor; it is not written by and does not necessarily reflect the views of The Atlantic 's editorial staff.

Around 10:45 Monday night, five of them were shot. None of their injuries was life-threatening.\n\nPolice arrested a 23-year-old white man and a 32-year-old Hispanic man, and are searching for a third white, male suspect. All three suspects fled the scene.\n\nProtestors say the men were counterdemonstrators. \"A group of white supremacists showed up at the protest, as they have done most nights,\" Miski Noor told the Star Tribune . The paper said that BLM demonstrators were trying to herd the counterdemonstrators away when the men opened fire.\n\nKSTP, a local television station, reports that police said the men were wearing bulletproof vests.\n\nClark, 24, was shot in the head by police on November 15 and died the following day. The circumstances of his death are murky. Police said he was a suspect in a domestic violence call and was interfering with responders. Several witnesses said Clark was handcuffed and lying on the ground when he was shot, a claim police deny. The activists outside the precinct station have demanded the release of video of the incident. It's unclear what the video might show. The state's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension has taken over the case and gathered footage from several sources, but said it wouldn't release the videos until it had completed an investigation. The BCA also said that no single video shows the entire event.\n\nTuesday is also the one-year anniversary of rioting in Ferguson, Missouri, after a grand jury decided not to charge Officer Darren Wilson in the death of Michael Brown, a touchstone moment in national protests against police violence. Black Lives Matter Minneapolis posted a statement on Facebook saying, \"We will not be intimidated,\" and calling for people to join in a March Tuesday afternoon.\n\nPolice have reported a series of incidents since Clark's shooting, including gunshots and Molotov cocktails being thrown at police cars. Clark's death has brought renewed focus to a long history of tension between the Minneapolis police and the community-in particular the African American community-and to questions about discipline and violence on the force."

His grandmother had called 911 to report a domestic disturbance, Tucson Police Chief Chris Magnus said in a Wednesday press conference.\n\n\"In this video, we see a person who is clearly distressed. A person asking for water, asking for help, asking for his nana,\" Tucson Mayor Regina Romero said Wednesday, before proposing sweeping police reforms. \"Now we must center the conversation to police accountability and transparency. When officers do not perform as trained, they need to be held accountable.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe three officers involved in the incident-which drew widespread outrage amid protests over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis-have already resigned. While authorities concluded \"no blows, strikes, chokeholds, knee to the neck, chemical or electronic weapons were used\" during the incident, Magnus said the officers involved did not follow department protocol.\n\n\"I can't say enough, this is a terrible tragedy,\" Magnus said, adding that he is offering his resignation over the \"horrible\" incident. \"The officers, in this case, did not live up to our department's high standard. He added that the three officers, who are Hispanic and Black, would have been terminated if they had not resigned.\n\nAuthorities said the April 21 incident began around 1 a.m. when Ingram-Lopez's grandmother called 911.\n\n\"She reported he was drunk, yelling, and running around the house naked,\" Magnus said, noting that the 27-year-old had been previously arrested for domestic violence and disorderly conduct.\n\nAccording to the body-camera footage released Wednesday, the officers arrived at the back of the house and found Lopez in the garage, where they immediately handcuffed him and placed him face down on the ground.\n\n\"Get on the fucking ground, get on the ground,\" one officer says, while several other individuals can be heard screaming. His voice trembling, Ingram-Lopez is heard saying, \"OK, please, please,\" to the officers.\n\nWhile the video is difficult to make out in the dark garage, the screams continue as officers continue to struggle to restrain the 27-year-old, who is heard crying and repeatedly apologizing to officers.\n\n\"I just want some water,\" he repeatedly says during the 25-minute video. \"I can't breathe,\" he complains minutes later.\n\nAfter several minutes, officers can be seen placing yellow blankets on top of Ingram-Lopez's naked body. \"You're going to get shocked dude, you're going to get zapped,\" an officer says at one point.\n\nApproximately 12 minutes into the incident, Magnus said officers discovered Ingram-Lopez was unresponsive. Concerned he had overdosed on drugs, the officers gave him Narcan and began CPR. When emergency medical personnel arrived at the scene, they continued to use life-saving measures-but it was too late, and the 27-year-old was pronounced dead on the scene.\n\nThe Pima County Medical Examiner stated that Ingram-Lopez's cause of death was \"a sudden cardiac arrest, with acute cocaine intoxication and an enlarged heart.\" The report, however, listed the manner of death as \"undetermined.\"\n\nMayor Romero said it was unacceptable that neither her office nor the public was notified of this death immediately after it happened and called for a \"swift but a thorough investigation\" into the incident. She is also proposing sweeping changes in the city's policing procedures, including establishing a community policing initiative. She added that she was not aware of Magnus' decision to offer his resignation, saying he has been \"an honest, a great police chief for the city of Tucson.\"\n\n\"People are mad, people are disappointed and rightfully so,\" she said.\n\nSenior National Reporter\n\nGot a tip?

The incidents occurred days apart in April 2021, long before the other five slayings that police have linked to the potential serial killer using ballistic tests. Those murders include Paul Yaw on July 8, Salvador Debudey Jr. on Aug. 11, Jonathan Hernandez Rodriguez on Aug. 30, Juan Cruz on Sept. 21, and Lawrence Lopez Sr. on Sept. 27. Police say that none of the victims-who, with the exception of Yaw, were all Hispanic men ranging in age from 21 to 54-were robbed or beaten prior to their deaths, though all of them were caught alone in the late hours of the night, according to Stockton Police Chief Stanley McFadden. The 2021 deaths include a 40-year-old unidentified Hispanic man who was shot and killed on April 10 in Oakland, and an unidentified Black woman who was shot around 3 a.m. on April 16 but survived the attack. \"It definitely meets the definition of a serial killer,\" said Stockton Police Officer Joseph Silva. Police were able to obtain a photo of the suspect by scrubbing through hundreds of hours of video surveillance footage.

      "text": "The Only Crimes on the Rise in Donald Trump's Hometown Are Hate Crimes\n\nSpecial Correspondent\n\nThe subway passenger felt secure enough in present day New York City that he allowed himself to doze off while seated aboard a Manhattan -bound F train during the morning rush on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving.\n\nAfter all, crime in New York is down 50 per cent since 1998, 80 per cent since 1990. Robberies are down 21 per cent compared to the same time last year, despite the sharp curtailment of \"stop-and-frisk\" that supposed experts said was sure to trigger a rise in crime.\n\nAnother man boarded the train at Jay Street in Brooklyn and sat next to the dozing passenger. The car filled so that those who subsequently boarded had to stand. Some no doubt grabbed the center poles to steady themselves.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFormer NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton once remarked to the Daily Beast that the sight of hands of every kind-manicured and grimy, dainty and tough-one atop the other is what he would present to someone as a symbol of New York's greatness in old times and new.\n\n\"It's the center pole,\" Bratton said. \"Every day five and a half million people hang on it.\"\n\nHe added, \"And by and large they get along.\"\n\nThe dozing passenger happened to be Asian and 63 years old. The man beside him happened to be Hispanic and in his 30s. They rode on with the rest of the train from stop to stop.\n\nAround 9:20 am, as the train was reaching the Bryant Park-42 nd Street station, the Asian man awoke. The Hispanic man flew into a rage whose immediate cause was unclear. The nature of it was made unmistakable by his words.\n\n\"Why don't you go back to your own country?\"\n\nThe Hispanic man proceeded to spit on the Asian man and punch him in the face and body. The attacker then hurried off the train and disappeared. The assault was added to the growing tally in the one category of crime that has skyrocketed in our new president's hometown.\n\nAs of last Tuesday, bias crimes in New York had spiked 400 per cent since the election as compared to the same two-week period last year.\n\n\"We are up considerably,\" said the present NYPD police commissioner, James O'Neill.\n\nO'Neill remained cautious about ascribing a particular cause to the rise. But he had noted several days before, \"I have no scientific evidence as to why, but you've been paying attention to what's been going on in the country over the last year or so and the rhetoric has increased, and I think that might have something to do with it.\"\n\nEven so, O'Neill is not one to jump to conclusions. And the NYPD is tasked with assisting the Secret Service in providing security for the new president, no less so because many of us believe him more responsible than anyone else for the heightened rhetoric.\n\nAlong with placing a considerable security burden on New York with plans to keep his penthouse as a residence during his presidency, Donald Trump has almost certainly helped spur a hate crime spike in a city that derives its greatness from its diversity and otherwise leads the rest of the country in crime reduction.\n\nTo make it worse, Trump seems to have no understanding of the policing miracle that occurred all around him in recent years as he sat in his tower. Trump suggested during the Presidential debate on suburban Long Island that \"stop-and-frisk\" had led to the unprecedented decrease in crime in New York City and that crime had gone up after \"stop and frisk\" was curtailed. Hillary Clinton rightly disagreed .\n\n\"Crime has continued to drop, including murders,\" Clinton said.\n\n\"No, you're wrong,\" Trump replied. \"You're wrong.\"\n\n\"No, I'm not,\" Mrs. Clinton said.\n\n\"Murders are up, all right,\" Trump said. \"You check it.\"\n\nStop-and-frisks in the city were down by 97 per cent since 2011, but murders during that same period were not up, but down, by 32 per cent. That, after an already astonishing drop by more than 50 per cent since 1993.\n\nAlong with those facts comes this: even as Trump was promising to \"make America safe again,\" he did not bother to learn how the city where he was raised and where he continues to reside managed to make itself the safest big city in America .\n\nSince his election, his only public reference to safety in New York came on November 19, after Vice-President elect Mike Pence was booed by some audience members at a showing of Hamilton.\n\n\"The Theater must always be a safe and special place,\" Trump tweeted. \"The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!\"\n\nAs with crime reduction in New York, Trump was either indifferent or ignorant when it came to the particulars. The cast had not shown the slightest disrespect. The actor playing Aaron Burr, Bernard Victor Dixon, had stepped forward at the end of the performance to say \"there is nothing to boo here\" and to welcome Pence. Dixon had then spoken on behalf of all those who suddenly felt less safe everywhere after Trump's election. His words are as worth rereading as any of those of the real Aaron Burr.\n\n\"We, sir, are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir. But we hope this show has inspired you to uphold our American values, and work on behalf of ALL of us.\"\n\nIn a speech of his own back on election night , Trump had also called for people to come together and promised to be the president for ALL of us. But those had just been the words of a demagogue who had gotten what he wanted and now wanted to escape any responsibility for the incendiary and hateful things he had said to get it. His game clearly was to make it seem as if he were the unifier and his opponents were the dividers and the haters.\n\nBut although he could suddenly announce that Hillary Clinton had been a worthy opponent and go from \"lock her up!\" to leave her be, the poisonous passions he had unleashed in defeating her could not be dispelled simply because he was coaxed into looking into a camera on 60 Minutes and saying, \"stop it\" to those inspired to hate and violence by his win.\n\nFor all the talk during the campaign of him going \"off message,\" Trump had in fact stayed right on message the whole time; it is okay to judge people by their race, ethnicity and religion and to brand entire groups as rapists and to mock the disabled and to scoff at the family of a fallen hero and to tell unending lies even about 9/11 and to denigrate women and even boast about sexually assaulting them. His election apparently affirmed all that for his supporters and his central message remained toxically supreme no matter what mixed ones he has since begun sending.\n\nBias crimes continued across the country. His hometown witnessed an average of more than two a day while every other category of crime in New York remained at lows rightly termed historic.\n\nSix days after Trump was nudged to finally say \"stop it,\" four young Muslim men were approached by a trio of white men as they sat on a bench in Trump's native borough of Queens.\n\n\"I don't want any Muslim sitting on the bench,\" one of the white men was heard to say.\n\nThe white man then hit one of the Muslim men in the face with a bottle, fracturing his eye socket.\n\nAt least the Asian man on the subway three days later escaped serious injury.\n\nBut there are sure to be others, for the psychic pestilence he unleashed will still be out there, whether or not Trump ends up flip-flopping about Obamacare and everything else. You might dub him President Pandora were it not unfair to the woman of Greek myth to associate her with the hoohah grabber in chief.\n\nHours after Tuesday's bias attack on the subway, Trump flew off to Florida for Thanksgiving at his Mar-a-Lago estate. He returned on Sunday evening to New York and the tower that is now protected by more than 100 of the cops who perform the continuing miracle of making his hometown the safest big city in America in every crime category but the one he helped incite.\n\nTrump is of course one New Yorker who can count himself safe in every regard.\n\nSpecial Correspondent\n\nmichael.daly@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

Meanwhile, Zimmerman's family has launched a public effort to defend him, while a white supremacist has apparently hacked into Trayvon Martin's email and Facebook accounts in an effort to tarnish his image. We speak to Natalie Jackson, an attorney for Trayvon Martin's family. \"Clearly, they are trying to protect their family member,\" Jackson says of interviews Zimmerman's relatives have given to the media. \"I guess they have a right to do that. But the problem is, they don't have a right to destroy Trayvon's memory in the process.\" [includes rush transcript]\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : New questions are being raised in the Trayvon Martin case over George Zimmeman's claim that he shot the 17-year-old in self-defense last month in Sanford, Florida. Speaking anonymously to Anderson Cooper by phone, a witness to the shooting said last night he observed a struggle between Zimmerman and Martin from a nearby window. While Zimmerman told police he was attacked by Martin, the witness said Zimmerman did not show any signs of injures after he shot the teenager. The witness's voice was distorted to protect his identity.\n\nWITNESS : I can't say I actually watched him get up. But maybe only within like a couple seconds or so, then he was walking towards where I was watching, and I could see him a little bit clearer, could see that it was a Hispanic man, and he was-you know, he didn't appear hurt or anything else. He just kind of seemed very-you know, I can't speak for him, but very worried or whatever, walked like on the sidewalk at that point and his hand up to kind of his forehead. And then another man came out with a flashlight.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That interview was on CNN . In other developments, the New York Daily News has revealed the mother of a young witness said her son was \"pressured\" by police. Police have said that 13-year-old Austin Brown saw Zimmerman lying in the grass crying for help just before the slaying, but Brown's mother says her son only saw one person lying in the grass, and he couldn't tell who it was because it was too dark. The Daily News is also reporting a former co-worker of Zimmerman says the gunman was fired from his job as an under-the-table security guard for, quote, \"being too aggressive.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a white supremacist hacker has claimed to have broken into Trayvon Martin's Gmail, Yahoo!, MySpace and Twitter accounts and posted his private messages online. Some commentators have described it as part of a racist smear campaign against Trayvon Martin.\n\nMeanwhile, members of George Zimmerman's family have begun speaking to the media. Zimmerman's father, Robert Zimmerman, appeared on Fox 35 in Florida and explained what he understood to have happened the night Trayvon Martin died.\n\nROBERT ZIMMERMAN : Trayvon Martin walked up to him, asking, \"Do you have a [bleep] problem?\" George said, \"No, I don't have a problem,\" and started to reach for his cell phone. At that point, he was punched in the nose. His nose was broken, and he was knocked to the concrete.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : George Zimmerman's brother, Robert Zimmerman, Jr., appeared on CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight . He stood behind his brother's claim of self-defense even though police surveillance video showed Zimmerman walking into the Sanford police station with no visible signs of blood minutes after he shot and killed Trayvon Martin.\n\nROBERT ZIMMERMAN , JR.: What I think I see is a swollen nose. Now, I'm not a physician. You're not a physician. A lot of these injuries take time-24 hours, 36 hours-to show the bruising. Sometimes the bone breaks, and the blood is swallowed, like in the case of, for example, if your hand would be on someone's nose and mouth preventing them from speaking out.\n\nPIERS MORGAN : Does he have any injuries now?\n\nROBERT ZIMMERMAN , JR.: His nose is still broken.\n\nPIERS MORGAN : It's still broken?\n\nROBERT ZIMMERMAN , JR.: His nose is still broken, yeah.\n\nPIERS MORGAN : A month later, it's still broken.\n\nROBERT ZIMMERMAN , JR.: His nose. I don't know about the back of his head. I mean, his nose is still healing. It's not healed. He's not-he has very severe emotional injuries. He has very-he's been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : While you could see Robert Zimmerman, Jr.'s face on Piers Morgan , when his father went on Fox TV, he was in silhouette.\n\nWell, for more, we go to Orlando, Florida, where we're joined by Natalie Jackson. She is the attorney for Trayvon Martin's family, founder of the Women's Trial Group.\n\nWelcome to Democracy Now! Thank you so much for joining us, Natalie Jackson. Can you respond to these latest stories being presented by George Zimmerman's father and brother?\n\nNATALIE JACKSON : Clearly, they are trying to protect their family member. And I guess they have a right to do that. But the problem is, they don't have a right to destroy Trayvon's memory in the process. Trayvon was an innocent child. There is nothing that he was doing wrong. He was not involved in any criminal activity, and he had a right to be where he was.\n\nMy response to them is that, you can tell us whatever you want to, but we have the call that George Zimmerman made, where he said, \"These A-holes always get away.\" He was told not to get out of his car; he continued to get out of his car. And he also said that Trayvon was running away from him. We also have telephone calls that Trayvon made and prove-telephone records-that he was on the phone when George Zimmerman approached and attacked him. We also have, now, a video that shows that George Zimmerman did not have the injuries that his family members are claiming and that he claimed.\n\nSo, it comes to where there is no explanation for people who were not there, such as me and his family members. People who want to know the truth, all they have to do is listen to the video-I mean, listen to the audios and view the videotapes. It's there for people to see.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : And, of course, you have raised serious questions about the initial investigation. And the new police chief there is actually-was part of that investigation?\n\nNATALIE JACKSON : He was a part of that investigation, we're told. Now, what your audience has to remember is that the family has not been given any information about the investigation into the death of their son. Everything that they are learning is coming from the media. It's coming from people who are sources, and it's coming from-it's coming at the same time that the public is getting it. This is a family who lost their child, their 17-year-old child. And the law enforcement has not released any information to them. That's why they started this campaign. They want to know what happened when their son was coming home from the store and George Zimmerman got out of his car with a nine-millimeter and shot him dead.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to play more from the eyewitness who spoke to Anderson Cooper on CNN last night. He says he observed the struggle between George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin from a window. The witness's voice was distorted to protect the person's identity.\n\nWITNESS : I couldn't hear the words, but it was like, OK, this is not a regular conversation. You know, this is someone aggressively, you know, yelling at someone. Saw two men on the ground, one on top of each other, obviously thinking, OK, something really horrible is happening. And at that point, not looking out the window, I heard the yell for help, one yell for help, and then I heard another, as I described this, excruciating type of yell. It didn't even almost sound like a \"Help.\" It just sounded so painful. But I wasn't watching out the window during that. And the next time I looked out the window there, the same thing: two men on the grass, one on top of each other. I kind of thought like they-I couldn't see a lot of movement, because it was very dark, but I felt like they were scuffling. And then I heard the gunshot, which, to me, were more like pops than they were like a bang.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Witness that was talking to Anderson Cooper on CNN . Can you-Natalie Jackson, can you talk about the significance of this person coming forward?\n\nNATALIE JACKSON : This person is another witness. You know, there are many witnesses in this case, and there's a lot of ear evidence and eye evidence that needs to be presented to a jury. I can't talk about the credibility of this witness nor any other witness, nor George Zimmerman. That is a question for a jury. This case has not-it won't get to a jury if George Zimmerman is not brought to trial. And that is what happened in this case. When these parents found out that their child had been shot and killed by George Zimmerman, they were told law enforcement could do nothing about it because it was self-defense. That is not the way our system works. That's not America. He needs to be brought before a jury of his peers. Let them decide who's credible, who's not credible, and whether or not he can claim self-defense. There is no doubt who the shooter is. The shooter is George Zimmerman.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : Well, it would seem to me also that the forensic evidence, which is bound to come out-it should obviously be presented in a grand jury, but certainly in a trial-would indicate a lot about the proximity of Zimmerman to Martin when the shooting occurred and a lot more in terms of the angles of the bullets. But we have not heard anything about that so far.\n\nNATALIE JACKSON : Yeah, and all of that is for a jury. The point is, is that these parents are told there was not even probable cause to arrest. After we have all of this evidence, these parents-and they were told there was no probable cause to even arrest George Zimmerman. That's not a satisfactory answer. And it's especially not a satisfactory answer now that we see all of the evidence that is coming out.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Natalie Jackson, can you talk about the significance of both the police chief of Sanford stepping aside, though he has said not permanently, as well as the state's attorney, the person who originally said, after tremendous pressure, after the Justice Department announced an investigation, that they would convene a grand jury in a few weeks, Norm Wolfinger?\n\nNATALIE JACKSON : Well, the significance is, is that now this family feels like they may get some justice for their son. There has been a special prosecutor assigned. This is a prosecutor that is not from the area, does not know the people. And there has been a grand jury convened that is supposed to convene on April 10. The family is feeling more positive. Now, I will say, actions speak louder than words, because this family has heard a lot of words. But they're feeling more positive that perhaps a fair and equal treatment will be given to this case.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you explain something, Natalie Jackson, that we haven't seen in the media? First of all, where was Trayvon shot? How was he shot, in what part of his body? And how was it that his family didn't find out for several days that he was the John Doe in the morgue that had been not-that had not been identified?\n\nNATALIE JACKSON : OK, we haven't received the autopsy yet, so everything we know about where Trayvon was shot comes from the person who prepared the body. And it was in the center of the chest. The release of the body-the parents knew where Trayvon was the next day, when they filed a missing person's report. However, he was labeled a John Doe for three days, even after the parents identified [him] as [their] son. That is the problem. So that was a little bit of people not quite understanding what happened.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you explain that?\n\nNATALIE JACKSON : No, we can't. The parents asked for the release of the body. He was labeled a John Doe. They would not release the body for three days.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : So, in other words, they were informed by the next day that he was dead?\n\nNATALIE JACKSON : Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : But was that only after they had filed a missing person's report?\n\nNATALIE JACKSON : That is correct, after they had filed a missing person's report.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : And what are the next steps for your legal team? And what are you calling for, what you believe has to happen immediately?\n\nNATALIE JACKSON : We believe what has to happen is that we have to continue these media tours to inform the public so that the public will keep the pressure on. There was an online petition to arrest George Zimmerman. That online petition has over two million signatures. This is two million people of all nationalities, all races and all political affiliations, two million people who look at this evidence that is presented and says George Zimmerman needs to be arrested and brought to trial. And as of now, that has not happened. So, until that happens, until he's brought to trial, then we will continue to put the pressure on.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : And you've had to hire your own investigators because of the terrible job that has been done so far by authorities in ascertaining the facts in this case?\n\nNATALIE JACKSON : Yes. And, you know, I don't know if it's a terrible job or just they thought it was inconsequential to do the job. You know, there's-whether or not it was important to do or it was bungled, we don't know. But we had to go out and investigate this case. We hired an investigator that got the phone records. And once we saw Trayvon's phone record, because he was on the-he had his phone with him, and we saw that he was on the phone when this incident purportedly happened. We contacted the person he was on the phone with. It was a young girl. And she told us that she heard Zimmerman approach Trayvon. And this is very extraordinary, because she and Trayvon-according to the phone records, there was a phone call at 7:12. The phone call lasted for four minutes. That would make it 7:16. According to police records, they were on the scene at 7:17, and Trayvon was dead. So, this young girl is a very important witness.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And the issue of Trayvon's life, his reputation being attacked, I mean, his mom saying, \"First they kill my son, then they kill his reputation\" - what do you know of this white supremacist who supposedly hacked into the-his Twitter account, Facebook, email? What do know about this?\n\nNATALIE JACKSON : We don't know anything. We know that he's ignorant, and he's just as ignorant as the black militia who put out bounties on people. These are ignorant people who are divisive. There is a whole group of people who are united together in justice, and they are united across all races, all nationalities, all political affiliations. We cannot let these people divide and distract from what really happened. This is about the evidence that will be presented, the factual evidence, not everyone's subjective opinions or their baggage that they're bringing into this.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Natalie Jackson, we want to thank you for being with us, local co-counsel for Trayvon Martin's family. She's the founder of the Women's Trial Group. She's speaking to us from Orlando, Florida, about a half an hour from Sanford, where Trayvon Martin was killed.\n\nThis is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . When we come back, we take a trip through history, look at Trayvon's Martin case and the story of Emmett Till, 14-year-old African-American boy in Money, Mississippi, who was lynched. We will speak with a woman who was taught by Emmett Till's mother, Mamie Till Mobley. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "China is calling it \"Black Monday.\" Global stocks are falling as China's markets saw their sharpest daily fall since the global financial crisis in 2007. The Shanghai Stock Exchange plunged 8.5 percent Monday, sending shock waves throughout Asian and European markets. Today's fall comes after weeks of decline in the Chinese markets, which led the Dow Jones to plummet by more than 500 points on Friday. The decline also caused oil prices to plunge to their lowest levels in almost six years.\n\nFrench President François Hollande has awarded the Legion of Honor, France's highest award, to three Americans and one British citizen on Monday for their role in thwarting an attack in a high-speed train traveling to Paris from Amsterdam on Friday. No one died. The three Americans, two of them servicemembers, tackled and disarmed the suspected gunman, a 26-year-old Moroccan man, Ayoub el-Khazzani, whom police say European authorities suspected of being an Islamist militant, although he was not being tracked. The lawyer for the suspected gunman says her client denies that the attack was motivated by terrorism, and that he was only a poor man intending to rob train travelers because he was hungry.\n\nSophie David : \"I asked him whether he knows what he is being accused of. It is the first thing we do to see if they understand what their rights are. He replied, 'Yes.' But when I reminded him of why he was there, he was stunned by the terrorist nature which is being given to his actions.\"\n\nIn news from North Carolina, protests erupted at the Charlotte courthouse after a judge declared a mistrial in the case of a white police officer who fatally shot an unarmed African-American college student who was seeking help after a car crash in 2013. Randall Kerrick, the police officer, faced charges of voluntary manslaughter for shooting 24-year-old Jonathan Ferrell. According to prosecutors, the college student had sought help from a homeowner after a car crash, but the woman had called the police because she believed she was being robbed. When officers arrived, one pointed the laser of his taser at Ferrell's chest. Ferrell fled in fear and attempted to hide between the two police cars. This brought Ferrell close to Officer Kerrick, who then opened fire, striking Ferrell 12 times. On Friday, the jury said it was deadlocked on whether to convict the officer.\n\nIn Ohio, anti-choice activists are pushing for a new law that would make it illegal for a doctor to perform an abortion if a woman is terminating the pregnancy because the fetus has tested positive for Down syndrome. The bill is being pushed by the National Right to Life Committee. The Legislature is expected to approve the measure. Ohio Republican Governor John Kasich, who is running for president, has not said whether he supports the bill, although he has signed a slew of anti-choice legislation since taking office in 2010.\n\nIn Germany, right-wing protesters clashed with police over the weekend during demonstrations against a newly opened migrant shelter in a small town outside of Dresden. Pro-immigration activists staged a counter-protest, holding signs that read \"Refugees Welcome.\" The demonstrations followed the interior minister's announcement that Germany could receive as many as 800,000 asylum seekers this year, the biggest influx since the Second World War.\n\nMeanwhile, the Italian Coast Guard says it rescued 4,400 migrants at sea in over 22 operations on Saturday alone. This comes as thousands of other migrants resume their journeys north through Macedonia after the country reopened its border with Greece after declaring a state of emergency and sealing the border last week.\n\nGuatemalan President Otto Pérez Molina rejected calls to step down Sunday night, following the resignation of the majority of his Cabinet over the weekend. The president has faced months of massive protests amid a growing corruption scandal, which has led to arrests of top officials, including the former vice president. The government is accused of running a multimillion-dollar scheme in which importers paid bribes to Tax Authority officials to obtain discounts. On Sunday, the Roman Catholic Church called for the president's resignation, but Pérez Molina rejected those calls.\n\nGuatemalan President Otto Pérez Molina : \"I declare categorically that I reject any link to the scandal or having received money from that money-defrauding operation. My conscience, in that sense, is at peace. ... I reaffirm that I will not resign, and will fully submit myself to the legal process. Good night, and may God bless you.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in Lebanon, at least one protester has died as massive demonstrations against government ineptitude rocked the capital Beirut. Riot police fired water cannons, rubber bullets and tear gas at the thousands of protesters. The Red Cross says at least 40 people have been hospitalized. The growing campaign, which is dubbed \"You Stink,\" began as a protest against the massive piles of garbage that the government has failed to collect. It has now become a cry for the government's fall.\n\nIn Yemen, tribal sources and local officials say two apparent U.S. drone strikes killed seven people over the weekend. In both attacks, the dead are being described by officials as suspected al-Qaeda militants. Meanwhile, dozens of people have died following U.S.-backed, Saudi-led airstrikes on Friday on the southwestern city of Taiz.\n\nIn news from Afghanistan, at least 12 people have died following a suicide car bomb in the capital Kabul on Saturday. Officials say the target of the attack was a NATO convoy. Three Americans working for private contractors were killed, along with nine others.\n\nAt least 50 people have died in Syria following government airstrikes Saturday on a residential area of Douma, a city northeast of Damascus. Meanwhile, the self-proclaimed Islamic State has destroyed the ancient Baalshamin Temple in the Syrian city of Palmyra. News agencies reported the destruction occurred Sunday, although the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the temple was destroyed by ISIL last month.\n\nAt least 21 people have died in Somalia following two suicide car bomb attacks on Saturday. The first attack struck a training base for government troops, killing 16 soldiers. The second attack struck an intersection on the capital Mogadishu, killing five. The militant group al-Shabab has claimed responsibility for the attack on the training base.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders held his first campaign rally in South Carolina Friday night. The move was seen as an attempt by Sanders to court black voters, who still overwhelmingly support former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. At the event, Sanders invoked the names of men and women who have been killed in police or jail custody in recent years.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders : \"We must be clear that when we're talking about racism, we are talking about Sandra Bland, Michael Brown, Rekia Boyd. We are talking about Eric Garner. We're talking about Walter Scott, Freddie Gray and many others, many, many others over the years whose names we do not know. And these people died unnecessarily and wrongly at the hands of police officers or in police custody. That must change.\"\n\nIn more news from the campaign trail, Vice President Joe Biden is increasingly expected to join the race as a Democratic candidate. Biden met with Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren on Saturday to discuss economic policy.\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump has responded to the case of two brothers in Boston accused of attacking a 58-year-old Hispanic man with a metal pole and urinating on his face. Police say that when the brothers were arrested, he told them, \"Donald Trump was right - all these illegals need to be deported.\" On Friday, Trump tweeted, \"Boston incident is terrible. We need energy and passion, but we must treat each other with respect. I would never condone violence.\" Trump drew 20,000 people at his speech on Friday night in Mobile, Alabama, although campaign organizers had expected as many as 35,000. Bernie Sanders still holds the record for audience size at campaign rallies in the 2016 race.\n\nAnd women in Saudi Arabia are registering to vote for the first time in the nation's history ahead of upcoming municipal elections in December. Women will also be permitted to register as candidates and run for office in the December elections. The shift implements the late King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz's 2011 decision to grant women the right to vote and run for office."

On Tuesday, Obama met with congressional Republicans in an effort to muster bipartisan support.\n\nPresident Obama : \"We're still going to have to have much better financial regulation. We've got to get credit flowing again. We're going to have to deal with the troubled assets that many banks are still carrying and that make the - that have locked up the credit system. We're going to have to coordinate with other countries, because we now have a global problem. I am absolutely confident that we can deal with these issues, but the key right now is to make sure that we keep politics to a minimum.\"\n\nThe Obama administration has agreed to several Republican demands, including a $69 billion proposal to exempt middle-income Americans from the so-called alternative minimum tax. Obama has also reportedly agreed to cut an expansion of contraceptive coverage under Medicaid.\n\nIn the Gaza Strip, hundreds of Palestinians have fled their homes amidst a new round of Israeli bombings in the town of Rafah. Israel says it's targeting smuggling tunnels in response to an attack that killed one of its soldiers near the Gaza border on Tuesday. The bombings come as Middle East envoy George Mitchell is in Egypt on the first stop of his Mideast tour. Earlier today, Mitchell warned against the collapse of the informal ceasefire.\n\nMiddle East envoy George Mitchell : \"It is of critical importance that the ceasefire be extended and consolidated, and we support Egypt's continuing efforts in that regard. The United States is committed to vigorously pursuing lasting peace and stability in the region. The decision by President Obama to dispatch me to come to this region less than one week after his inauguration is a clear and tangible evidence of this commitment.\"\n\nIn other news from Gaza, officials with the Palestinian Water Authority say they're now two months behind on repairing a critical sewage plant because of damage from the Israeli assault. The officials say several air strikes badly damaged water pipes, and Israeli army bulldozers \"deliberately destroyed\" the chambers of five water basins. The plant was under emergency repair to prevent it from overflowing and endangering some 10,000 people. The repair was supposed to have been completed this week, but the damage from the Israeli attack means it won't be done until at least March. The Independent of London reports the plant's repair had been virtually the only development aid project allowed by Israel in the last eighteen months.\n\nDefense Secretary Robert Gates is warning of what he calls Iran's \"subversive activity\" in Latin America. Gates spoke Tuesday before the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nDefense Secretary Robert Gates : \"I'm concerned about the level of, frankly, subversive activity that the Iranians are carrying on in a number of places, in Latin America, particularly South America and Central America. They're opening a lot of offices and a lot of fronts, behind which they interfere in what is going on in some of these countries. To be honest, I'm more concerned about Iranian meddling in the region than I am the Russians.\"\n\nGates also addressed Afghanistan, where Obama is planning on escalating the US occupation.\n\nDefense Secretary Robert Gates : \"There is little doubt that our greatest military challenge right now is Afghanistan. As you know, the United States has focused more on Central Asia in recent months. President Obama has made it clear that the Afghanistan theater should be our top overseas military priority.\"\n\nGates's comments come as the Obama administration says it plans on taking a \"tougher line\" toward Afghan president Hamid Karzai. The New York Times reports White House officials now see Karzai as \"a potential impediment to American goals\" because of corruption in his government. But Karzai has also recently angered US officials by criticizing deadly US air strikes and demanding a timetable for a withdrawal of foreign troops.\n\nIn Brazil, more than 100,000 people are gathering for the ninth World Social Forum. A crowd of some 50,000 kicked off the event Tuesday with a march through the Amazon city of Belem. The World Social Forum gathers social movements from around the world under the theme of \"Another world is possible.\" It's timed to coincide with the gathering of corporate leaders in the Swiss town of Davos.\n\nIn Illinois, the impeachment trial of Democratic Governor Rod Blagojevich continued for a second day Tuesday. Blagojevich is boycotting the proceedings. State senators heard six minutes of tape in which Blagojevich discusses signing legislation in return for a campaign contribution. Blagojevich has said the tapes are being taken out of context.\n\nHere in New York, former Merrill Lynch CEO John Thain has been subpoenaed as part of a state probe into executive bonuses at firms that have received bailout money. Thain resigned this week following the disclosure he handed out $4 billion in bonuses a month ahead of schedule. The bonuses were approved just three days after shareholders OKed Merrill Lynch's merger with Bank of America. Bank of America was given billions in additional bailout money for the takeover.\n\nIn Massachusetts, three white men have been indicted on civil rights charges for burning a predominantly black church on election night. Law enforcement officials say the fire was intentionally set in response to President Obama's win. The church was nearly finished with an expensive renovation when it was burned to the ground.\n\nMeanwhile, one of three suspects charged for a string of election night hate crimes in New York has pleaded guilty. Brian Carranza faces up to ten years in prison. Two other suspects have pleaded not guilty and are free on bail. According to police, the three drove around Staten Island black neighborhoods on election night looking for victims to attack. A black Muslim teenager was beaten with a baseball bat, sending him to the hospital. They also attacked another black man, a Hispanic man, and drove down a white man they thought was an African American. The man spent more than a month in a coma."

The president has faced months of massive protests amid a growing corruption scandal, which has led to arrests of top officials, including the former vice president. The government is accused of running a multimillion-dollar scheme in which importers paid bribes to Tax Authority officials to obtain discounts. On Sunday, the Roman Catholic Church called for the president's resignation, but Pérez Molina rejected those calls.\n\nGuatemalan President Otto Pérez Molina : \"I declare categorically that I reject any link to the scandal or having received money from that money-defrauding operation. My conscience, in that sense, is at peace. ... I reaffirm that I will not resign, and will fully submit myself to the legal process. Good night, and may God bless you.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in Lebanon, at least one protester has died as massive demonstrations against government ineptitude rocked the capital Beirut. Riot police fired water cannons, rubber bullets and tear gas at the thousands of protesters. The Red Cross says at least 40 people have been hospitalized. The growing campaign, which is dubbed \"You Stink,\" began as a protest against the massive piles of garbage that the government has failed to collect. It has now become a cry for the government's fall.\n\nIn Yemen, tribal sources and local officials say two apparent U.S. drone strikes killed seven people over the weekend. In both attacks, the dead are being described by officials as suspected al-Qaeda militants. Meanwhile, dozens of people have died following U.S.-backed, Saudi-led airstrikes on Friday on the southwestern city of Taiz.\n\nIn news from Afghanistan, at least 12 people have died following a suicide car bomb in the capital Kabul on Saturday. Officials say the target of the attack was a NATO convoy. Three Americans working for private contractors were killed, along with nine others.\n\nAt least 50 people have died in Syria following government airstrikes Saturday on a residential area of Douma, a city northeast of Damascus. Meanwhile, the self-proclaimed Islamic State has destroyed the ancient Baalshamin Temple in the Syrian city of Palmyra. News agencies reported the destruction occurred Sunday, although the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the temple was destroyed by ISIL last month.\n\nAt least 21 people have died in Somalia following two suicide car bomb attacks on Saturday. The first attack struck a training base for government troops, killing 16 soldiers. The second attack struck an intersection on the capital Mogadishu, killing five. The militant group al-Shabab has claimed responsibility for the attack on the training base.\n\nIn Malaysia, police say they have unearthed the mass graves of more than 20 people who are believed to be human trafficking victims. The graves were found along the border with Thailand in a region known as a transit point for human smuggling. The site was close to where authorities found a mass grave containing the remains of 26 bodies in May.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders held his first campaign rally in South Carolina Friday night. The move was seen as an attempt by Sanders to court black voters, who still overwhelmingly support former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. At the event, Sanders invoked the names of men and women who have been killed in police or jail custody in recent years.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders : \"We must be clear that when we're talking about racism, we are talking about Sandra Bland, Michael Brown, Rekia Boyd. We are talking about Eric Garner. We're talking about Walter Scott, Freddie Gray and many others, many, many others over the years whose names we do not know. And these people died unnecessarily and wrongly at the hands of police officers or in police custody. That must change.\"\n\nIn more news from the campaign trail, Vice President Joe Biden is increasingly expected to join the race as a Democratic candidate. Biden met with Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren on Saturday to discuss economic policy.\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump has responded to the case of two brothers in Boston accused of attacking a 58-year-old Hispanic man with a metal pole and urinating on his face. Police say that when the brothers were arrested, he told them, \"Donald Trump was right - all these illegals need to be deported.\" On Friday, Trump tweeted, \"Boston incident is terrible. We need energy and passion, but we must treat each other with respect. I would never condone violence.\" Trump drew 20,000 people at his speech on Friday night in Mobile, Alabama, although campaign organizers had expected as many as 35,000. Bernie Sanders still holds the record for audience size at campaign rallies in the 2016 race.\n\nAnd women in Saudi Arabia are registering to vote for the first time in the nation's history ahead of upcoming municipal elections in December. Women will also be permitted to register as candidates and run for office in the December elections. The shift implements the late King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz's 2011 decision to grant women the right to vote and run for office."

Representative Luis Gutierrez, Democrat from Illinois, was among the dozens of protesters arrested on Tuesday for peacefully occupying the White House sidewalk. Representative Gutierrez participated in the act of nonviolent civil disobedience one day after he received a letter from the President rejecting his proposal to suspend deportations of undocumented college students with clean criminal records.\n\nIn his letter, Obama claimed that immigration authorities were deporting fewer immigrants who lack legal status but have not been convicted of any crime. However, immigrant rights activists say the majority of those deported under Obama's watch have had no criminal records whatsoever. They also note that the Obama administration has ramped up deportation efforts through programs like Secure Communities, which allows immigration agents to peer into the databases of local and county jails to check the fingerprints of anyone who's booked against federal immigration databases.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : On Monday, President Obama addressed the National Council of La Raza, the Latino civil rights organization, defending his deportation policies, saying Republicans remain an obstacle to overhauling the immigration system. When Obama claimed he could not single-handedly use his presidential executive authority to reform deportation policies, audience members interrupted him and began chanting, \"Yes, you can!\"\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : Now, I know some people want me to bypass Congress and change the laws on my own. Believe me, and-and believe me, right now, dealing with Congress, the idea-\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS : Yes, you can! Yes, you can! Yes, you can! Yes, you can! Yes, you can! Yes, you can!\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : But believe me-believe me, the idea of doing things on my own is very tempting. I promise you, not just on immigration reform. But that's not how-that's not how our system works.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER : Change it!\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : That's-that's not how our democracy functions. That's not how our Constitution is written.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : Despite Obama's claims that his hands are tied, immigrant rights activists continue to say he has the power to use his executive authority to grant administrative relief to undocumented immigrants.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're joined right now from Washington, D.C., by Congress Member Luis Gutierrez, the Democratic Congressman from Illinois, chair of the Immigration Task Force of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Congress Member Gutierrez, among those arrested Tuesday while protesting outside the White House.\n\nWelcome to Democracy Now! , Congress Member Gutierrez. Why did you get arrested exactly?\n\nREP . LUIS GUTIERREZ : Because I think we have to bring attention to the plight, to the destructive, corrosive nature of our broken immigration system. Because I have Specialist Nunez, a wonderful young Hispanic man who served five years in the military, signed up again because he thought he had to go fight in Afghanistan. And you know what? His wife is deported to Ciudad Juárez in Mexico. Because we have so many thousands and thousands and thousands of families. Because we have four million American citizen children. You know, today, there are going to be American citizen children who are going to lose their parents. And so, I thought that for one moment, I should have my hands clasped together with handcuffs and taken away a short period of time, to bring attention and to say, I denounce these policies as immoral.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : And Representative Gutierrez, your immediate reaction when you got the letter from President Obama, because I know you've been lobbying on this issue with him now for many months, and his final determination that he's not going to move and use his executive authority?\n\nREP . LUIS GUTIERREZ : Yeah. Well, you know, Juan, we've been kind of having a dialogue with him, right? And conversations with high-ranking members of his administration. In May, Senator Menendez, I and Charlie Gonzalez and a group of members, we sat down with the President for a little over an hour, in which we stressed that he has it. So, if you read the letter carefully, look, it's not that he says he doesn't have the power. It really says, \"I'm not ready to use it in the manner in which you suggest I use it.\" In other words, we said to him, \"Look, why not just do what 22 U.S. senators, including Leahy, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, including Dick Durbin\"-he's the senator from the state of Illinois, a very close friend and confidant of the President. Twenty-two U.S. senators wrote the President an open letter saying, \"Set the DREAM kids aside. Say to a million eligible immigrants in America, you're not going to deport them. Give them a work permit. And in the meantime, we'll continue to work on that legislative process.\"\n\nAnd let me say that I think the letter is very disingenuous, because, Juan, as you look at the last paragraph, it says, \"Luis, why don't you use that moral authority, that energy, to go and get the Congress of the United States to change the laws that you feel are unfair?\" Let me suggest-I want to tell your audience something. In December of 2010, a week before Christmas, I sat but three feet away in the Oval Office with the President, and he said to me, \"Luis, we will not have an opportunity or the ability to pass any comprehensive immigration reform 'til after my reelection as president of the United States.\" And he furthermore says, \"We can't-we won't be able to have the numbers.\" So, to say to us now, \"I'm not going to use my authority, but go get the Congress to get-to act,\" he already told me, he already acknowledged, seven months ago, that that was a futile process. And so, we need to continue to encourage him to have an honest, open discussion with us. In other words, what he says to us behind doors, he should say to us when he's speaking to us publicly.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : When Obama ran for office in 2008, he said he was going to deal with the issue of immigration in his first year. Well, that promise has remained unfulfilled. In the speech at National Council of La Raza's annual conference Monday, Obama blamed Republicans for the stalemate on immigration reform.\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : I need a dance partner here. And the floor is empty.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Your response, Congress Member Gutierrez?\n\nREP . LUIS GUTIERREZ : Look, OK, dance partner? For two years, we know, we had a 50-vote majority in the House of Representatives. We were 60. And in the end, we were 58 in the Senate. Please, tell me when he asked and called the party and the dance, so that Republicans and Democrats could dance together to bring about comprehensive immigration reform. In other words, now when there are insufficient numbers of us, he wants to call the dance. Well, you know, look, Mr. President, you wasted. You let two years go by. You showed little or no enthusiasm, energy or importance or priority to this issue, and now you have a huge problem, demonstrated at National Council of La Raza, because what is the debate? The debate in our community has really been, the President says, \"Ah, it's the Republicans, they need to just go-Congress needs to act,\" and our argument has been, \"We have conferred upon you extraordinary executive powers, conferred upon you. Already the Congress has given you those powers. Use them. That's what they're there for, so that you can use them.\" And we have senators and groups and people. Look, there's not a debate whether the president has these powers. He has them. He is reluctant. He refuses to use them.\n\nAnd so, Juan asked me about the letter. I have to tell you, it really saddened me, because it was so tough, right? It was so rigid. It was like, \"Yeah, I'm the chief enforcement officer of the laws of the nation, and that's-you guys are right. That's what I'm supposed to do. And by the way, I'm not going to do what you guys suggest I could do.\" He just literally just takes it-there's no room. Look, at National Council of La Raza three years ago, the President? The roof came off the room when he spoke three years ago, right? Because what did he say three years ago, is he said, \"When babies are being torn from their mothers' arms, when children arrive home to find their parents missing, when you have ICE raids abundant in our community with no legal recourse,\" he said, \"that's wrong, and it's time to change it.\" And the place went crazy, right? I mean, the energy in the place, that energy carried to the election in November, when more than two million more Latinos voted in 2008 than 2004. He got two-thirds of that vote, carrying Nevada, carrying New Mexico, carrying Colorado and carrying Florida. I mean, people feel a sense of-that they're in this. They heard his message. And now they feel that he has to-that he has to fulfill his promise.\n\nAnd let me suggest to everybody, I'm going to continue. Five hundred thousand young-500,000 Latinos turn 18 every year in this country, and they're all American citizens. I'm going to continue to tell them, \"Register to vote.\" I'm going to continue to help people that are permanent residents that can become citizens to become citizens. I'm going to continue to engage and use the muscles-right?-of democracy. Part of that muscle is protest, right? It invigorates our democracy. The other one is registering people to vote and giving them power. I'm going to expand that base of people, and at the same time, tell the President of the United States, \"I want them to stand with you, but if you're going to get their vote, you've got to stand with them.\" So this is really not about how I feel or about other people feel. We want him to be successful.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Congress Member Gutierrez, we just have 15 seconds. With dance partners, often one person leads. Who's leading? Obama or the Republicans?\n\nREP . LUIS GUTIERREZ : Right now the Republicans are leading, in their anti-immigrant, obviously xenophobic march both in the House and in the Senate. And you know what? With the same energy and vigor that they lead against us with hatred and bigotry, we want him to stand up with that same energy for us. And if he does that, we're going to have a community that is vibrant and that can be successful and victorious.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Congress Member Gutierrez, thanks so much for joining us from the Russell Rotunda of the Senate Office Building in Washington, D.C. Just a few days ago, he was arrested in Washington, D.C., protesting the more than million deportations under President Obama's administration. Congress Member Luis Gutierrez is from Chicago.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Bartlett is the former chief of the Bias Crimes Unit of the Westchester County District Attorney's Office and the former chair of the Westchester County Human Rights Commission. [includes rush transcript]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're joined on the phone right now by Kenneth Chamberlain Jr., the son of Kenneth Chamberlain Sr., the African-American former Marine who was shot dead by police in his home on November 19th, 2011, when his LifeAid medical alert pendant went off and the LifeAid company called police for medical assistance at his home.\n\nKenneth Chamberlain, the grand jury has just come back. There will be no charges against police officers involved in the killing of your father. Your response?\n\nKenneth Chamberlain, can you hear us? Ken-ah, it looks like he's in a TV studio, and he's not able to hear us right now, problems with the sound. So we're going to go to Mayo Bartlett, the attorney for the Chamberlain family, for Kenneth Chamberlain Jr. Your response to the grand jury decision not to indict the police officers?\n\nMAYO BARTLETT : Well, from the very beginning, we were interested in getting an independent arbiter with respect to this, because we know that grand juries are secret in New York, so you can basically present the same information any number of different ways. We don't know what charges were actually presented. We don't know who the target was. And it appears to me that the grand jury was more of an investigative grand jury that would give you a report than it was one that targeted actual suspects. And one of the things about that presentation is that if the district attorney's office had a good-faith belief that one or more of these officers were guilty of a crime, they could have simply charged them by misdemeanor information or by felony complaint, and then, afterwards, presented the matter to the grand jury, which would be the norm for anyone else who's arrested. Instead, the grand jury is often used to cover politically for a figure, for a district attorney. So if the grand jury indicts, it's not the district attorney's fault. They simply presented the evidence, and the grand jury indicted. If the grand jury chooses not to indict, well, then the grand jury essentially is blamed, but that's an anonymous group of 23 individuals.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, Mayo Bartlett, I especially would like to ask you about this whole issue how this-the law enforcement handled this investigation, because there have been many cases in the past where, in high-profile cases, the grand jury not only does a-reviews the evidence, but actually issues a report. It happened, for instance, in the Tawana Brawley case many years ago. It happened in the killing of Kevin Cedeno when Manhattan District Attorney Morgenthau issued a complete report. But in this case, what happened was the district attorney only announced the finding of the grand jury not to indict. And then, within moments, the Westchester Police Department released, to me, an unprecedented amount of its internal documents to the press, so the DA did not have to comment on anything, and the department then sought to do the damage control, basically, to justify what the grand jury had decided. Have you ever seen this enormous release of internal records of the police department and of these tapes so quickly after a grand jury concludes its deliberations?\n\nMAYO BARTLETT : I have absolutely never seen that. And I believe very strongly that if this information had been released earlier, we may have had an indictment, because the grand jury would have been in a position to ask different questions. We don't know whether they heard all of these tapes, whether they heard them in context. If you hear things out of context, for instance, you may be given the impression that Mr. Chamberlain is making threats early on and that Mr. Chamberlain is unstable early on. But when you have the complete tapes, you know that he's telling them repeatedly, for at least 15 minutes, that he's fine, he's OK, and he doesn't need help. So one of the problems is the fact that all of this information is released, but I think it's released in a very self-serving manner.\n\nAnd generally, you would expect a grand jury to take direction from the prosecution. So, quite often in criminal cases, we get grand jury minutes when a witness is about to testify. And when you read those grand jury minutes, you see that the grand jurors themselves are actually asking questions, and quite often the district attorney determines that those questions are not relevant, especially when those questions go toward credibility or go toward the strength of the case. So they never really get to fully explore the case.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to go to another part of the LifeAid recording that we haven't played. Now, just let me explain why there are these recordings. This is the LifeAid medical system where the patient, Kenneth Chamberlain, had a weak heart, wears this LifeAid pendant. We actually saw it on the video when you could see through the crack in the door. He had something around his neck. So, it's not clear how it was triggered, the LifeAid pendant. Maybe when he was sleeping he rolled over. It was 5:00 in the morning. That alerted the LifeAid company. They have a system to record in the apartment of the patient. And that's why we have this audio recording that was released by the police. So this recording is recording not only what's happening in the room, and you hear those discussions between Kenneth Chamberlain's sister and the LifeAid operator. So this is a part of the recording that we have not played. You can hear a police officer banging on Kenneth Chamberlain's-banging on Kenneth Chamberlain's window after Chamberlain said he's OK. The officer responds by using a curse and the N-word. Listen closely.\n\nOFFICER STEPHEN HART : Mr. Chamberlain!\n\nKENNETH CHAMBERLAIN SR.: Don't do that, sir. Don't do that. Don't do that, officer. Don't do that. Don't do that. Don't do that. Do not do that! I'm telling you I'm OK!\n\nOFFICER STEPHEN HART : Open up the damn door, nigger!\n\nKENNETH CHAMBERLAIN SR.: I'm telling you I'm OK!\n\nOFFICER STEPHEN HART : [inaudible]\n\nKENNETH CHAMBERLAIN SR.: I'm telling you I'm OK.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And I want to replay just a bit of that, if you missed what the police officer was saying outside the window the first time.\n\nOFFICER STEPHEN HART : Open up the damn door, nigger!\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Mayo Bartlett, explain.\n\nMAYO BARTLETT : Well, it's inexplicable, because just that alone, you would think that if a district attorney's office is presenting this case fully, that means more than just presenting a charge of murder in the second degree for a grand jury to consider. We don't know what they presented or with respect to whom. But if you only present murder in the second degree, you're asking a jury to find that the officers arrived at Mr. Chamberlain's house with the sole intent of killing [him] and that they formed an intent to actually deprive him of his life. And that's-that's a difficult thing to ask that jury to find when they were responding to a medical call. But if you give them the full gamut of charges, you allow them to consider reckless conduct, reckless endangerment, criminally negligent homicide, manslaughter, official misconduct. And I would think that simply that language right there, cursing at Mr. Chamberlain, taunting him-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And saying what exactly?\n\nMAYO BARTLETT : And saying, quote-unquote-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : But don't say the words.\n\nMAYO BARTLETT : \"I don't give an F,\" and then using the N-word, is unbecoming and unprofessional. And the entire course of conduct leaves so much to desired, that it's a breach of their actual protocol.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Yeah, Mayo, that-the officer who uttered those words, the district attorney's office has confirmed that those words were said and that that's being-the police department is looking into the actions of that officer. But that officer was identified in the minutes of the-in the transcript of that recording as a Police Officer Stephen Hart.\n\nWhat I noted in my column in the Daily News today was that there were at least three officers at the scene that night who were, at that very moment, facing a civil-federal civil rights claims against them in federal court by citizens who had claimed they had abused them.\n\nThere was Carelli himself, who actually shot Mr. Chamberlain, who's facing a-still about to go to trial in a civil federal lawsuit of civil rights violations against two Jordanian immigrant brothers who alleged that he beat them while arresting them in a precinct and called them \"ragheads.\"\n\nThere is Stephen Hart himself, who was at the window and used the N-word, who is also facing claims by an African-American woman that he used a-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Hart, as you write-\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: I'm sorry.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : -was caught on tape, \"facing his own civil suit in federal court from a young Hispanic man.\"\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Hispanic man, right. The vice president of a-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Edgar Maurado.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: The vice president of a bank, who claimed that he threw him to the pavement, beat his head on the pavement, broke his nose, while arresting him for disorderly conduct.\n\nAnd then, finally, Sergeant Fottrell, one of the supervisors on the scene, who is facing a-who just finished a trial from an African-American woman who claimed that he used a stun gun on her while arresting her, although he was acquitted in that trial.\n\nThree of them were facing, at that very moment that they were in Chamberlain's house, charges by citizens who claimed that they had abused them. So, this is part of what you're looking at in terms of calling for a federal investigation of the White Plains Police Department?\n\nMAYO BARTLETT : Absolutely. We know that people are not going to be perfect. We know that the officers won't be. But when the officers exhibit this type of behavior, the department has the responsibility of overseeing them and determining whether they're still fit to serve as police officers, and if so, in what capacity. And it's clear that the White Plains Police Department and the city of White Plains as a whole turns a blind eye to these things. And if these officers engaged in this same conduct without being able to hide behind a badge and a shield, they would be charged with felonies, serious felonies. They would very well be in jail.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: I'd also like to ask you about the issue of-because the police have claimed that Mr. Chamberlain advanced on them twice with knives-once inside the apartment and once as they were trying to break down the door. Now, the video of the police attempts to break down the door are really chilling, because you don't really get a sense of the fear that that can put in you, because they were-they were using crowbars. There were using axes. There was an ax visible, a police ax, as they were attempting to break down his door. But there was a claim that Chamberlain had tried to use-initially it was reported as an ax, put through the door, that the police grabbed away from him. Then it was later downgraded, because-and I know by discussions with the district attorney's office-they said it was a meat cleaver, not an ax. And now it turns out that in the reports of the police officers on the scene, it was an eight-inch butter knife that went through-that he tried to put through the door and was taken away from him. In fact, you hear the police officers say, \"We got the knife away from him,\" before they even entered the apartment. Now, there is an issue of what happened inside the apartment, whether there was a second knife that he attempted to use against them. Your response to this claim of the weapons?\n\nMAYO BARTLETT : The police can make anything a weapon. If they came in here right now, they could take this mug I have in front of me and say it's a weapon, because I could use it as a dangerous instrument. But the police took, I guess, what they claim is a butter knife without incident. And what's important to remember here is that that occurred fairly well into this entire episode. Mr. Chamberlain was in his home 5:00 in the morning, and he had advised police and LifeAid numerous times, over a 15- to 20-minute period, that he was OK and didn't need assistance.\n\nThe police department's own protocol requires them to call people when they go on a medical emergency to make sure that they can establish contact with the person that way. And if they can in fact do that, it can end even there, if they're satisfied that that's the person. Now, they claim that they knew Mr. Chamberlain, so they knew who they were going to speak to, and they knew who they were speaking with. And he said he was fine. LifeAid actually asks to withdraw and recall their call for assistance. And once the door is taken down and the police are advancing into Mr. Chamberlain's home, the video shows that Mr. Chamberlain standing, not advancing toward the police. And it's important to note that at no point in time is it even alleged that Mr. Chamberlain ever left his house to confront anybody.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : On the audiotapes from the LifeAid company released yesterday, you can hear attempts by the LifeAid dispatcher and Kenneth Chamberlain's sister, Carol, trying to defuse the situation. At one point, Kenneth's sister Carol wants to call her brother to see if she can help him calm down. So the LifeAid dispatcher calls the police to relay this idea to them.\n\nOFFICER CIANCI : Yeah, White Plains Police. This is 64.\n\nLIFEAID OPERATOR : Yes, Operator 64. This is Operator JR01. I not too long ago spoke to you.\n\nOFFICER CIANCI : Yeah, what's going on?\n\nLIFEAID OPERATOR : OK, I gave Carol-well, she actually gave us a call back. She would like to call Kenneth's home, and she would like for you to tell the officers to tell him to answer his phone.\n\nOFFICER CIANCI : Ma'am, we've got a-we've got a pretty serious situation going on over here, OK?\n\nLIFEAID OPERATOR : That's what I told her.\n\nOFFICER CIANCI : So, tell her to relax. We're trying to work it out on our end. But right now we're not going to play mediator or anything between the two of them. OK? We can't play those games right now. We've got a serious situation going on, and we're trying to figure it out. We're trying to get a resolution going. So just-\n\nLIFEAID OPERATOR : No, I understand completely.\n\nOFFICER CIANCI : We want to do our best. I know it's not your fault. You're just relaying her message. But right now, you know, we don't need to relay her messages to us at this point. Just tell her that we're trying to resolve the situation the best we can. OK?\n\nLIFEAID OPERATOR : OK, I'll let her know that.\n\nOFFICER CIANCI : So, thank you very much.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That is Kenneth Chamberlain's sister-the LifeAid operator, rather, talking to the police. Mayo Bartlett?\n\nMAYO BARTLETT : Well, when you have family members that can assist in situations like this, it's negligent, at a minimum, to ignore those individuals and not to let them try to help out. I mean, that would have possibly defused the entire situation.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "Wisconsin man charged with hate crime in acid attack on Hispanic man\n\nMahud Villalaz suffered second-degree burns on his face in an attack outside a Milwaukee restaurant\n\nA 61-year-old white Milwaukee man accused of throwing acid on a Hispanic American man's face will be charged with a hate crime, prosecutors announced Wednesday.\n\nProsecutors filed one charge against Clifton Blackwell - first-degree reckless injury - but added hate crime and use of a dangerous weapon. The two sentencing enhancers could add 10 years in prison if he's convicted of first-degree reckless injury, which is punishable by up to 25 years.\n\nThe victim, Mahud Villalaz, 42, said his attacker approached him near a restaurant Friday night and confronted him about being parked too close to a bus stop, according to charging documents. Prosecutors said Blackwell then asked, \"Why did you invade my country?\" and \"Why don't you respect my laws?\"\n\nVillalaz said he moved his car but that Blackwell continued to berate him, calling him \"illegal\" and telling him to \"go back, go back\", followed by an expletive. Villalaz said he called Blackwell a racist, also using an expletive. Villalaz said Blackwell threw the acid on him after Villalaz said \"everyone come from somewhere first\".\n\nSurveillance video from the restaurant recorded the attack, which left Villalaz with second-degree burns on his face. Villalaz is a US citizen who immigrated from Peru.\n\nThe attack on Villalaz comes at a time when the Anti-Defamation League says extreme anti-immigrant views have become part of the political mainstream in recent years through sharp rhetoric by anti-immigration groups and politicians, including Donald Trump.\n\nBlackwell does not yet have an attorney, according to court records.\n\nBlackwell's family said he's a military veteran who came to Milwaukee to seek help for an undetermined medical issue. His mother, Jacqueline P Blackwell, of California, told the Journal Sentinel he had sought care with the Department of Veterans Affairs in Milwaukee for post-traumatic stress.\n\n\"I was comfortable that he was getting good care with the VA,\" she told the newspaper.\n\nHis brother, Arthur Eugene Blackwell of Evergreen, Colorado, told the AP that Clifton served nearly four years in the US marines and was stationed at the Panama Canal around the time Manuel Noriega was captured and removed in 1990. A marine official told AP that the branch doesn't have a record matching Blackwell's name and birthdate.\n\nState court records show Blackwell was convicted in a 2006 Rusk county case of false imprisonment and pointing a gun at a person in a case where he held four hunters at gunpoint because they were on his property."

      "text": "'He died in agony': how mistaken identity led to a man's execution\n\nShocking documentary The Phantom, the story of Carlos DeLuna, an innocent man accused of murder, shines a light on the many problems with the death penalty\n\nI n the final minutes of The Phantom, Patrick Forbes' shattering new documentary on the American death penalty, a prosecutor from Texas who possesses an uncanny resemblance to a grizzly bear shares with us his thoughts on crime and punishment. \"The justice system's about keeping people from killing each other,\" Steve Schiwetz begins.\n\n\"Does it work perfectly?\" he goes on, the faintest smile flickering disconcertingly across his face. \"Of course not, nothing does. We're humans.\"\n\nAnd then, in one of several jaw-dropping instances in the movie, he quotes Immanuel Kant. \"The crooked timber of humanity, out of which nothing straight can be made. Right?\"\n\nThe tableau leaves the viewer with so many bewildering questions. Is the prosecutor unaware of the booming irony of his comment that by sending people to the death chamber the state is trying to keep them from killing each other?\n\nWhat is a tough-as-steel criminal prosecutor in the violence-soaked city of Corpus Christi doing citing the German philosopher? Above all, can he not see the sickening implication of his reflection that we are all human, mistakes happen, when the context of his remark is the judicial killing of a death row prisoner?\n\nEspecially given that he, Steve Schiwetz, was lead prosecutor at the trial of Carlos DeLuna, a poor Hispanic Texan who was convicted of a murder that he did not commit and executed on 7 December 1989, aged 27, as an innocent man.\n\nThe Phantom, which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival, is a journey into the heinousness at the heart of the US death penalty. Heinous not in the sense peddled by conventional true-crime documentaries with their psychopathic killer, blood-splattered crime scene and gruesomely murdered victim - though there is plenty of all that in this movie too.\n\nBut heinous in the sense that the death penalty itself is so often rotten to the core.\n\nForbes, an eclectic film-maker whose previous work includes documentaries on WikiLeaks and heart attacks , has never before strayed into the world of capital punishment. He emerged from the experience clearly shaken.\n\n\"At the end of the film I was angrier by far than when I started it,\" he told the Guardian. \"Everything in the Carlos DeLuna case that could go wrong did go wrong - there was no proper disclosure, the defense was completely underfunded, the appeal was rushed through. Not only was he killed an innocent man, the lethal injections didn't work and he died in agony.\"\n\nForbes's curiosity in the story of Carlos DeLuna was piqued by a Guardian article from 2012 which reported on the discovery that the state of Texas had sent the wrong man to his death. The article was based on an exceptional piece of sleuthing by a Columbia law professor, James Liebman, and his students who had set out to prove something that advocates of capital punishment vehemently deny - that mistakes are made and innocent prisoners die.\n\nThe resulting book, The Wrong Carlos , provides a forensic deconstruction of a judicial screw-up of astronomical proportions. DeLuna, then 20, was arrested on 4 February 1983 for the brutal murder of Wanda Lopez, a young woman working at a service station in the coastal city of Corpus Christi on the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nFrom his arrest until the day of his execution, DeLuna protested his innocence. Not only did he insist he wasn't the murderer, he identified who was - his tocayo, namesake in Spanish, Carlos Hernandez. DeLuna said that on the night of Lopez's murder he had stumbled on the scene at the service station and witnessed the other Carlos stabbing Lopez to death. DeLuna said he was terrified by what he saw and fled - only to be caught by police in Hernandez's place.\n\nThe two Carloses not only shared the same name, they also looked remarkably similar, to the extent they were often mistaken as twins. Hernandez had a long criminal record, including numerous raps for violently assaulting women using exactly the same type of knife, a lock-blade buck knife, that killed Lopez.\n\nHe had been a suspect in the knife murder of another woman investigated by the same local prosecutor's office, and may well have been a minor police informant in Corpus Christi known well to the authorities. Yet at trial, Schiwetz told the jury that Carlos Hernandez did not exist. He was a figment of the defendant's imagination - \"the phantom\" of the movie's title.\n\nForbes said that the instant he read the Guardian article, he was hooked. \"I thought this is the most extraordinary story, it's the stuff of drama. Not only was there an innocent man unjustly convicted, but it was a capital case and he went to his death.\"\n\nThe film-maker said he was drawn to the narrative because it raised such vital questions about truth and preconceptions. \"Initially, everybody believed one truth: Carlos DeLuna was guilty. He had a criminal record, he was found hiding under a truck close to the murder scene, and he concocted this ridiculous defense that the murderer wasn't him but another guy called Carlos. Yeah, right.\"\n\nOver the eight years the documentary was in gestation, Forbes set himself two ambitions. First, he wanted to make a 360-degree picture. \"I wanted everybody talking. That was key. I wanted everyone involved telling the story, not me narrating as the voice of God.\"\n\nThe second ambition was to eschew the tired visual compromise served up by so many documentaries in which interviewees are plonked on a sofa in front of a bank of lights and statically recorded. \"I thought, we can try harder than that. In a film, characters don't sit still on sofas, they move from location to location. I wanted to capture them in the place where they were frightened, where they fell in love, where they did something terrible. That way the whole thing comes alive.\"\n\nThe combination of these two goals led Forbes to some of the film's most compelling content. We hear Schiwetz quoting Kant from the very courtroom where he told the jury that Carlos Hernandez was a \"phantom\".\n\nWe hear from Margie Tapia, who is filmed inside the house where Carlos Hernandez, the phantom, kept her locked up and abused over months. She describes how he would beat and rape her, and threaten her, yes, with a knife.\n\nWe hear too from a woman called Dina Ybañez, crouching behind a curtain in fear even years later. She rented a room out to Carlos Hernandez. One day he came back from work and pulled out a lock-blade buck knife.\n\n\"He stabbed me,\" Ybañez says, unbuttoning her shirt to reveal a scar running from below her belly-button to her breastbone. \"I pulled the knife from me. He told me, the next time, he was going to make sure I die.\"\n\nForbes said that was one of the most moving scenes he has shot as a documentary-maker. \"It was so straightforwardly human. She was still traumatized. The almost childlike nature of the moment - 'Look, I'm going to show you.' I thought, that's what living with a psychopath really involves, something awful can happen at any time.\"\n\nForbes's determination to capture voices in the actual location of the events they narrate not only generated dramatic energy for the film, it unearthed new leads in the DeLuna case. The most astonishing came when the crew was recreating DeLuna's arrest on the night of Lopez's murder.\n\nThey had procured a blue Chevy truck and parked it on the exact spot where the arrest took place, with an actor playing DeLuna crouching underneath it just as DeLuna did 38 years ago. Another actor then ran past simulating the fleeing of Hernandez after the stabbing.\n\nAs the cameras were rolling, neighbours from either side of the street came out to see what all the kerfuffle was about. One of them, Raymond Nunez, got chatting to a producer and explained that he had lived in the same house overlooking the scene of DeLuna's arrest since the 1980s and remembered that night vividly.\n\nHe'd been watching Jaws on the TV and heard \"a lot of ruckus outside\". Looking out of the window, he saw a Hispanic man running and ducking under the Chevy van.\n\nThen about 30 seconds later he saw a second Hispanic man run down the street before disappearing.\n\nForbes was incredulous when he heard this account - Nunez must have read about the DeLuna case and was telling the film-makers what he thought they wanted to hear. But Nunez turned out to be a highly believable witness: he had no criminal record, was a respected hospital worker and, indeed, had lived in the same house since the 1980s.\n\nThen one of the film crew had the inspired idea of checking the TV schedule for 4 February 1983. There it was on ABC's guide for that night: Jaws.\n\nIt was the first eyewitness account ever obtained to have reported that not one but two Hispanic men fled from the crime scene. Remarkably, Nunez had never been interviewed by police. Even more remarkably, it transpired that police had never, even in a case that would end in execution, carried out a house-to-house of the surrounding neighbourhood.\n\nBy the end of The Phantom, the discrepancies in the prosecution case are so legion that doubts about DeLuna's innocence are obliterated. The crime scene was awash with blood, yet at his arrest DeLuna had no blood on him, not even microscopic traces.\n\nSchiwetz had an office about 40ft away from that of another prosecutor who tells the film that he told Schiwetz about Carlos Hernandez when the name was invoked in Carlos DeLuna's defense at trial. Yet still Schiwetz told the jury he was a phantom.\n\nForbes has come away from the intense experience of creating The Phantom with several burning lessons. For one, always question the truth. \"Examine your preconceptions, because what you think is true may not be true,\" he said.\n\nThen there is race. The Carlos who was executed, the Carlos who got away, and the victim Wanda Lopez were all poor Hispanic people who counted for very little in the eyes of those with power.\n\nRacial disparities continue to distort the death penalty in Texas to this day. In the last decade, over 60% of those executed by the state have been people of color.\n\nRene Rodriguez, a late lawyer who represented Lopez's family in the case, describes on camera the prevailing attitude of prosecutors and police in Texas in the 1980s: \"If it involves somebody of color, they just don't give a shit. That's one less Mexican. That's the way it was back then.\"\n\nAbove all, this is a story about the fallibility of justice, and what that means when a person's life is at stake. It's all very well for Schiwetz to quote Kant on the \"crooked timber of humanity\", but that doesn't bring Carlos DeLuna back from the grave.\n\nNor will it bring justice for Wanda Lopez, so brutally slain in the service station. The Phantom, Carlos Hernandez, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for the attack on Ybañez just two months before his namesake was executed and died of natural causes in 1999 while serving time for a further knife offence.\n\nForbes hopes that his movie will have significance in encouraging Americans to stand up and say no to a judicial system that kills innocent people. A petition has been launched in tandem with the release of The Phantom with the backing of the Innocence Project, Equal Justice USA and other leading campaigns to pressure President Biden to immediately end the US government's practice of executions by commuting the death sentences of all 50 inmates on federal death row.\n\nLast Thursday the US attorney general, Merrick Garland, announced a moratorium on federal executions while a review is conducted, in what campaigners hope will be the first step towards a permanent ban.\n\nCarlos DeLuna won't get his life back, but for Forbes it would at least be something. \"His story shows that capital punishment has no place in a civilized society. If a mistake of this gravity can happen, there is no justification for the death penalty.\"\n\nThe Phantom is out now in US cinemas with a UK date to be confirmed"

      "text": "Pasco shooting: police will not say how many bullets fired at unarmed man\n\nOfficers investigating fatal shooting of Antonio Zambrano-Montes concede for the first time that three officers involved in shooting opened fire\n\nPolice investigating the fatal shooting of Antonio Zambrano-Montes, a Hispanic man shot dead by officers in Pasco, Washington, have declined to reveal how many bullets were fired at the unarmed 35-year-old, despite assuring reporters they have accounted for all the rounds discharged during the fatal incident.\n\nAt a press conference on Thursday, Sgt Ken Lattin of Kennewick police, the spokesman for the special investigative unit (SIU) of neighboring forces investigating the incident, conceded for the first time that all three officers involved in the shooting had opened fire. He would not reveal how many rounds were discharged, arguing the medical examiner's office would disclose the tally at a later date.\n\nZambrano-Montes was killed in a volley of fire last week at a busy intersection in Pasco. Police say the Mexican national was throwing rocks at traffic and officers just before the shooting. Video footage depicting the incident appears to show him running away from police and then raising his arms before turning towards the three officers. He is then shot dead. Community members, police reform advocates and the Mexican foreign ministry have argued the use of force against Zambrano-Montes was grossly unjustified.\n\nLattin also said the FBI were monitoring the police investigation into the incident, marking the potential for a federal intervention in the case.\n\n\"If [the FBI] chose to come in and take over, they certainly can. But right now they're just monitoring,\" said Lattin, adding that the Washington State crime lab had begun examining forensics from the case as a \"top priority\".\n\nLattin informed reporters that none of the officers were wearing body cameras, and that none were certified Spanish speakers, although it remains unclear if any of the officers attempted to address Zambrano-Montes is Spanish.\n\nMembers of Zambrano-Montes' family told the Guardian he was a monolingual Spanish speaker, a fact the SIU had yet to establish, Lattin said.\n\nLattin also said the police had not been able to establish where Zambrano-Montes had been sleeping for the last two weeks of his life, and described his behaviour just before the fatal incident as \"not normal\".\n\n\"None of you would throw rocks at cars,\" Lattin said to reporters.\n\nThe Guardian was informed by an anonymous worker at the Tri-City Union Gospel mission, a homeless shelter blocks away from the site of the shooting, that he had stayed there for approximately four days, just \"a couple\" of days before the shooting.\n\nFranklin County prosecutor Shawn Sant urged further witnesses to the shooting to come forward, assuring any who were not \"not here legally\", that they would not be punished as a result.\n\nThe Franklin County coroner Dan Blasdel has confirmed a coroner's inquiry into the shooting will occur after the SIU investigation, which is likely to take a number of months, has concluded.\n\nBlasdel told the Guardian that Zambrano-Montes has died as a result of \"multiple shots to the torso\" but that no further information on the number of bullets would be released until the case came before a jury.\n\n\"I have all the confidence in the world of the SIU investigation,\" Blasdel told the Guardian on Thursday. \"The reason that I set up the inquest is because there's a lot of Hispanic people that are pointing and saying this is cops investigating cops and so it's biased. That's not fair. So I want to make sure that's brought out to the public, that investigation is transparent and everyone can see that it's not bias.\"\n\nThe coroner's inquest will see six jurors hear evidence - at least half Hispanic - presented by the county prosecutor. Their decision on the lawfulness of Zambrano-Montes's killing is not binding."

      "text": "Sheriff David Clarke Jr: the black Democrat who is Trump's favorite cop\n\nThe Milwaukee lawman talks to Ed Pilkington about helping the president's push to deport undocumented migrants and playing 'smash-mouth politics'\n\nM eet President Trump's favorite cop: an African American, cowboy hat-wearing, God-fearing conservative who stands for election as a Democrat, likens Black Lives Matter to the KKK, and has a habit of threatening violence against his critics on Facebook.\n\nDavid Clarke Jr, sheriff of Milwaukee County in Wisconsin, is a local law enforcement leader who carries a national punch. Last year he toured the country as a Trump surrogate and was one of few black speakers at the Republican national convention; today, he regularly airs his provocative views on race and policing on Fox News. Sean Hannity, writing in a foreword to Clarke's new book, Cop Under Fire, calls him \"America's sheriff\".\n\nNow Clarke, a self-described \"Trumpster\", is on a new mission. He plans to turn part of his 800-officer strong department into an immigration detection force so that he can help to execute one of the president's most controversial and fearsome projects: rounding up and deporting millions of undocumented migrants.\n\n\"I feel I have an obligation,\" Clarke said in a two-hour interview with the Guardian in his Milwaukee sheriff's office. \"Otherwise I'm aiding and abetting. Criminal illegal alien crime is a problem in this country.\"\n\nTrump needs the extra muscle that local sheriffs and police chiefs can bring if he is to have any chance of implementing his controversial mass deportation plan. \"They have to have the help of local law enforcement or they really can't get this done,\" Clarke said. \"Everyone who is arrested for a misdemeanor or felony has to go through my jail.\"\n\nSo last week, Trump's favorite cop formally applied to join 287(g), the national system that delegates power from the federal immigration agency, Ice, to law enforcement departments. Under the program, Clarke would assign an as yet unspecified number of his 500 corrections officers at the county jail and 300 field patrol deputies to be trained by Ice in apprehending people for deportation.\n\nAt the end of a four-week training course in South Carolina, Clarke's officers would be vested with the full authority of the federal government to check the citizenship status of anyone they stop and question, potentially turning individuals found to be in the US without permission over to Ice for removal. That's a formidable capability that the Obama administration largely withheld from police officers to avoid blurring the lines between policing and immigration enforcement.\n\nUnder Obama, Clarke said, \"there were instances where we'd do a traffic stop, and there's a sense that the guy was maybe in the country illegally, not just because he's Latino - he doesn't have a licence, doesn't speak the language - pretty good chance, right? But we couldn't ask about it or do anything about it.\"\n\nUnder 287(g), by contrast, \"I can bring the guy in and start to do the questioning.\"\n\nThe idea that sheriff's deputies will soon be patrolling the streets of Milwaukee acting in effect as Ice agents has sent a chill across the Hispanic community, which accounts for about 9% of the county's almost 1 million population and the lion's share of undocumented residents. It's one thing for Ice agents to come pounding on your door in the middle of the night; it's quite another to know that cops could stop you at any time and ask for your papers simply, critics say, because you look Latino.\n\n\"Racial profiling of Latinos is already happening and this will embolden people with prejudices to act on them,\" said Christine Neumann-Ortiz of Voces de la Frontera, a Milwaukee-based community group that is leading protests against Clarke's immigration plans. \"Anyone who is booked through the county jail for something as trivial as driving without a license could find themselves put straight into deportation proceedings.\"\n\nClarke dismissed the racial profiling argument. \"Let's define what we profile: we profile criminal behavior, not ethnicity. This term 'racial profiling' is thrown out there as flame-throwing - call them racist! - I'm not afraid of that crap.\"\n\nAccording to the sheriff, the aim of 287(g) is to catch those undocumented immigrants who have engaged in serious crimes. He gave the example of a Hispanic man who was picked up earlier this month for having threatened the suspect's live-in partner and nine-year-old child with a knife and gun.\n\n\"This guy pulled a gun on his frickin' kids. I want this guy gone. I never want to see him again - he's a creep.\"\n\nClarke reckoned that this case was just the tip of the iceberg within the Latino community. So how many immigrants without papers are there in Milwaukee County who have committed such serious crimes?\n\nThat's a basic question that might be seen as the starting point of any discussion on whether the sheriff's officers should be used in deportations. Yet when asked to give a number, he admitted he had no idea. \"We can't capture that, you'd have to get that from Ice,\" he said.\n\n(Ice said it did not keep such data, and recommended that the Guardian contact local law enforcement - in other words, Sheriff Clarke - to \"see what they might have handy\".)\n\nThe emphasis on \"criminal aliens\" is straight out of the Trump playbook. The president has frequently cited violent crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, most memorably the murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco by a serially deported Mexican, as justification for his mass deportation plans.\n\nBut the argument is belied by the statistics. Numerous studies over many years have found that immigrants without legal status in the US commit fewer crimes overall than citizens.\n\nHispanic groups fear that it won't stop with serious crimes, that anyone stopped by the sheriff's deputies for even the most minor infractions - a broken car tail light, for instance - could find themselves flung into the deportation pipeline. \"That's Ice's problem, I'm worried about the criminal illegal,\" Clarke insisted.\n\nBut in his Guardian interview, the sheriff injected a note of ambiguity, suggesting that misdemeanors could be fair game. \"I don't think it's too much to ask for someone in this country illegally to abide by all our laws - I don't care what the crime is,\" he says. \"If I went to Mexico, I don't get to engage in misdemeanor crimes and then say, 'Well, it's just a misdemeanor.'\"\n\nClarke's supporters liken him to a radio show shock jock, calling him a \"black Rush Limbaugh with a badge\". His vitriolic style bears comparison - and he has been inundated with criticism from human rights groups since he announced his intention to join 287(g). The most personal attack that has been directed against the plan by political opponents and news outlets such as the local Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (he calls it the Urinal Sentinel) is that he is an absentee sheriff.\n\nHe is so focused on his national media profile, the argument goes, so desperate for a post in the Trump administration , that he has ceased to serve the people of his county. Why would he want to take on a whole new federal responsibility over immigration when he is failing to meet his existing obligations as sheriff?\n\n\"I'm insulted by that,\" Clarke responded when the Guardian put that to him. \"Maybe they think a black guy can't do more than one thing at a time. It's insulting.\"\n\nHis critics raise as evidence of his alleged neglect the incidence of no fewer than four inmate deaths at the Milwaukee County jail in the past year. One of the deaths, in which a 38-year-old with bipolar disorder died of dehydration after his water supply had been shut off for six days in response to his erratic behavior, was ruled a homicide.\n\nClarke called the storm over the jail deaths a \"manufactured issue. This is a disguised political attack. Four deaths in a jail, yeah, OK, there were four deaths in a jail, not connected in any way. People die in hospitals, people die in nursing homes, people die - doesn't mean we had anything to with it.\"\n\nBut surely, people don't die in hospital from dehydration?\n\n\"You cite one that might be problematic,\" he conceded, adding that \"this guy was in bad health. It was a contributing factor.\"\n\nClarke has responded to the claim that he is an absentee sheriff forcefully on social media. When the Democratic mayor of Milwaukee, Tom Barrett, mocked him for \"fightin' crime one conservative cable TV show at a time\", Clarke used Facebook to recall a 2009 incident in which Barrett \"got his ass kicked\" as he tried to protect a grandmother who was being harassed at the state fair. Then Clarke threatened the mayor: \"Time to crawl back into your hole Tom, unless you want some more of this because I have some.\"\n\nThe Facebook outburst was not isolated: Clarke is experienced in attacking opponents in openly pugilistic terms. At Trump's inauguration celebrations in January, he told a crowd that the only time he'd reach across the aisle to work with liberals would be to \"grab one of them by the throat\". An artist subsequently crafted a souvenir bobblehead toy portraying Clarke in his trademark cowboy hat with one hand saluting and the other reaching out for an opponent's neck.\n\nClarke is currently being sued by a Milwaukee resident, Dan Black, who alleges that he abused his sheriff's authority after they had an encounter in January onboard a flight from Dallas to Wisconsin. Black shook his head at Clarke in disapproval at the sheriff's longtime support of the Dallas Cowboys football team rather than the Wisconsin team, the Green Bay Packers.\n\nWhen they arrived back at Milwaukee airport, Black found himself detained, the lawsuit alleges, by six of the sheriff's deputies, who questioned him for 15 minutes before escorting him from the airport. After Black complained, Clarke posted his picture on Facebook with the words: \"Cheer up, snowflake ... If Sheriff Clarke were to really harass you, you wouldn't be around to whine about it.\"\n\nClarke told the Guardian he couldn't comment on the lawsuit as it was the subject of litigation, though he did add: \"Let me say this, frivolous lawsuit. This guy's looking for 15 minutes of fame, that's what it's about.\"\n\nThere's something odd about the way Clarke deploys such violent language against his adversaries. He is, after all, a law enforcement leader and a staunch \"law-and-order\" guy who was in the running for the post of homeland security secretary and is still in contact, he said, with the Trump administration.\n\n\"I play smash-mouth politics,\" he says. \"Politics is a contact sport. I didn't create the rules. It's hit or be hit. I understand the environment. People are trying to slit my throat politically and personally, so you better be ready when they come after you.\"\n\nThere's also an ambiguity to much that he says, such as his notorious tweet during the election in which he said it was \"pitchforks and torches time\". Was it a twisted joke, a metaphor for political activism, or a literal call to arms?\n\n\"I'll leave that to the reader,\" he says. \"People will say, 'Pitchforks! Oh, he's advocating violence!' No, I'm not. But I won't take it back or apologise.\"\n\nDespite his denials, such high-testosterone talk adds to the jitters around his intention of joining 287(g). If this is what he is like now, his detractors argue, how will he be when he gets his hands on immigration powers as well?\n\n\"Our position is, he is someone who is dangerous and reckless, he shouldn't be given any more authority,\" said Neumann-Ortiz.\n\nTrump's favourite cop, who has won four sheriff's elections since 2002, each time running as a Democrat and each time gaining almost 80% of the vote, is utterly unfazed. \"The voters will decide whether they like it or not, not the pro-immigration folks who are on me all the time. I don't care about the pressure and the politics - I took an oath and I'm going to do my job.\""

      "text": "Man in prison 16 years may be acquitted after DNA links crimes to serial rapist\n\nLos Angeles judge may exonerate Luis Vargas, who was convicted of three rapes, after tests found the crimes were actually committed by the 'Teardrop Rapist'\n\nA Los Angeles judge was expected Monday to exonerate a man convicted of three rapes after DNA evidence linked the crimes to a serial rapist wanted for assaults dating back two decades.\n\nLuis Vargas has been in prison for 16 years for crimes he didn't commit, according to the California Innocence Project at California Western School of Law, which took up his case in 2012.\n\nSpokesman Chris Saunders said judge William Ryan was expected to throw out Vargas' convictions during an afternoon hearing.\n\nDNA tests found that the crimes Vargas was convicted of were actually committed by the so-called Teardrop Rapist, who is known for a tattoo of a teardrop under his eye, Saunders said. Witnesses linked Vargas to the crime because he had a similar tattoo.\n\nThe Teardrop Rapist is linked by DNA to 11 crimes and suspected of 35 in total across the Los Angeles area, the Innocence Project said. He is on the FBI's most wanted list.\n\nOn the day of his sentencing in 1999, Vargas told the court, \"I'm concerned (the) individual (who) really did these crimes might really be raping someone out there, might really be killing someone out there.\"\n\nIn assaults going back to 1996 on victims ranging between 14 and 41 years old, the suspect in most cases tried to engage in conversation with a woman walking to work or school, then pulled a weapon, forced her into a secluded area and sexually assaulted her, officials have said. He was often armed with a gun or a knife.\n\nEvery one of the attacks has come in the morning between 5am and 8am.\n\nPolice in 2012 released several sketches of the suspect they described as a light-skinned Hispanic man between 40 and 55 years old.\n\nHis most striking characteristic is the tattoo some victims have reported seeing on his face, though even that was shrouded in uncertainty, with some remembering it on one side of his face and some the other, and some reporting one teardrop, others two.\n\nOfficials said there was even some evidence the man may have had the tattoo removed."

      "text": "New York plastic surgeon performs 'most extensive' face transplant ever\n\nEduardo Rodriguez provided a former firefighter with the face of a young man left braindead after a cycling accident, New York magazine reported\n\nA plastic surgeon at New York University's Langone Medical Center has performed the \"most extensive\" facial transplant ever.\n\nDr Eduardo Rodriguez performed the transplant over 26 hours in August. In that time, he gave a 41-year-old former firefighter from Tennessee, Patrick Hardison, the face of David Rodebaugh, a 26-year-old bike mechanic from Brooklyn who became braindead after a cycling accident this summer.\n\nThe procedure and the stories of the two men's lives were extensively detailed in a piece written for New York magazine by Steve Fishman and published on Sunday .\n\nHardison was badly burned when responding to a house fire in Senatobia, Mississippi, on 5 September 2001. He was given the semblance of a face with flesh transferred from his thighs, but in the years leading up to his surgery at Langone he underwent 71 operations at a rate of seven a year and became dependent on painkillers, wrecking his family life.\n\nOf his appearance before the transplant, Hardison told Fishman: \"Kids ran screaming and crying when they saw me. There are things worse than dying.\"\n\nFacial transplants are not common, but they have been performed around the world for 10 years. The first partial facial transplant was performed in 2005 on Isabelle Dinoire, a 38-year-old French woman who had been bitten by a dog. The first such operation in the US was performed in December 2008 on Connie Culp , a 46-year-old Cleveland woman who was shot by her husband four years earlier.\n\nIn Spain in 2010, a 31-year-old man named only as Oscar, a farmer who accidentally shot himself in the face, was given what was then described as the world's first full facial transplant .\n\nIn the US in 2011, surgeons at Brigham and Women's hospital in Boston gave a new nose, lips, skin, muscle and nerves to Dallas Wiens, a 25-year-old construction worker from Texas who was disfigured in an accident involving power lines. That operation was paid for by the US military . It could not restore his sight.\n\nRodebaugh's face was the third offered to Hardison, who met the pioneering Dr Rodriguez in 2012. The first was from a Hispanic man, whose family withdrew consent. The second was from a woman, which Hardison declined. Rodebaugh's face was offered through LiveOnNY , the New York organ donor network.\n\nIn the New York magazine piece, Fishman details the delicate, exhausting and perilous procedure which Dr Rodriguez followed - which he warned his patient would be \"the most extensive face transplant yet performed\".\n\n\"Two days after [Rodebaugh] was declared braindead,\" he writes , \"at 7.30am on 14 August, the surgery began. Rodriguez started on Rodebaugh, carefully dissecting the half-inch-thick scalp away from the skull. He worked from the back toward the ears, then the nose, which he sawed off. The trick was to cut away the tissue while preserving nerves, muscles and the carotid arteries and the internal jugular veins - the 'big pipes'.\"\n\nThe procedure was not without drama, as Hardison's jugular vein proved to be bigger than that which had belonged to Rodebaugh, causing Hardison to lose blood dangerously. Dr Rodriguez improvised, inserting one jugular into a minutely cut hole in the side of the other.\n\nHardison is now recovering. He will take immunosuppressant drugs for his life, and Dr Rodriguez told Fishman \"there will be a rejection - not if but when\". Dr Rodriguez estimated that between three and five of the other patients who have received facial transplants around the world died after the new tissue was rejected.\n\nOne of Hardison's sons, though, told Fishman : \"When I see his face, I want to memorise it, so the next time I see him, I know it's my dad.\""

      "text": "Firefighter receives full face transplant in surgery called 'historic'\n\nNinety-three days after transplant, surgeons say Patrick Hardison, a retired fireman injured when a burning roof collapsed on him, is making a full recovery\n\nSurgeons in New York have declared the most extensive face transplant ever a success, saying the procedure to give a firefighter the face of a brain-dead man stands as a \"historic\" achievement.\n\nIn August surgeons at New York University's Langone Medical Center performed the transplant for 41-year-old Patrick Hardison, a retired fireman from Mississippi who suffered disfiguring injuries when a burning roof collapsed on him, melting his mask, in 2001.\n\nNinety-three days after the transplant, which had more than 100 people working in two teams for 26 hours, lead surgeon Eduardo Rodriguez said that Hardison's body had not rejected the face, making him confident that the dangerous procedure could be called a success.\n\nMedical school dean Robert Grossman called the transplant, the most extensive ever, \"a major milestone and [a] critically important contribution to the advancement of science and medicine\".\n\nRodriguez had told Hardison he had a 50/50 chance at surviving the transplant, which involved the meticulous closure and reconnection of blood vessels and nerves, cutting away Hardison's scarred face, refitting facial bone and \"re-draping\" skin across his face.\n\nHardison received the face of David Rodebaugh, a 26-year-old bike mechanic from Brooklyn who was left in a vegetative state by a cycling accident. Hellen Irving, the head of a organ procurement organization, relayed a message from Rodebaugh's mother, who said that her son was \"born a miracle\" and now \"the miracle of David will live on\".\n\nRodebaugh's heart, kidney, liver and eyes were also donated to patients waiting for eligible transplants.\n\nIrving said that finding a match for Hardison was particularly difficult. The team needed to find a matching blood type, height, weight, skin tone, hair color and, \"most importantly, no antibodies that would cause Patrick to reject his donor\", she said.\n\nBecause the skin is the body's largest organ and its main defense - and thus its first and strongest guard against disease and infection - Hardison will have to take pills to suppress his immune system for the rest of his life, Rodriguez said.\n\nBetween three and five of the other patients who have received facial transplants around the world died after the new tissue was rejected, he said, and physicians generally expect to see some kind of rejection episode within 90 days of surgery.\n\nBut after three months Hardison is doing \"very well\", Rodriguez added. \"He just had a gyro at one of the sub shops.\" He said that in six months Hardison would not only be able to eat normal food but his speech would improve and the intense swelling should diminish dramatically.\n\nNext year doctors will also cut down the tissue of Hardison's new face to better tailor it to how he would like to appear.\n\nHardison also faces a long road of emotional and psychological recovery, Rodriguez said. \"There's a lot of scars that we still have to deal with. There's a lot of anguish.\"\n\nWhen people with serious disfigurements \"look in the mirror and try not to look in the mirror, they don't seem themselves as normal\", Rodriguez said. In 2001, for instance, Hardison did not look in the mirror for the 63 days after the fire before he made it home to his family.\n\nIn the 14 years before the transplant, Hardison endured 71 operations on his face, which was only preserved at all thanks to skin grafts but was left without eyelids, ears or a scalp. Two of his five children never knew his face before the fire, and he became addicted to the painkillers meant to help him cope with the agony of moving any part of his scarred face. For years, he wore a baseball cap, sunglasses and prosthetic ears in public. Therapy and counseling are part of his course with the NYU medical center.\n\n\"Now that he has a new face you can see that he's happy with it,\" Rodriguez said. \"It's his face, as he said it.\"\n\nPhysicians accompanied Hardison into the outside world, he added, finding themselves moved by the former firefighter's experience. \"We took him to Macy's to buy clothes and for him it was so remarkable that no one stared at him, no one looked him,\" Rodriguez said. \"It was a very emotional exchange for us.\"\n\nThe procedure and the stories of Hardison and Rodebaugh's lives were extensively detailed in a piece written for New York magazine by Steve Fishman and published on Sunday .\n\nOf his appearance before the transplant, Hardison told Fishman: \"Kids ran screaming and crying when they saw me. There are things worse than dying.\"\n\nRodebaugh's face was the third offered to Hardison, who met the pioneering Dr Rodriguez in 2012. The first was from a Hispanic man, whose family withdrew consent. The second was from a woman, which Hardison declined. Rodebaugh's face was offered through LiveOnNY , the New York organ donor network.\n\nThe successful transplant nearly coincides with the 10th anniversary of the first partial facial transplant , for a 38-year-old French woman named Isabelle Dinoirre, who was bitten by a dog.\n\nIn the US, a Cleveland woman named Connie Club, who was shot by her husband in the face, underwent the first transplant in 2008.\n\nThe first full facial transplant was given in 2010 to a Spanish man who accidentally shot himself in the face, and in 2011 a 25-year-old Texan received a new lips, skin, muscle, nerves and a nose in a procedure paid for by the US military , which wanted to use what was learned to help soldiers with severe facial wounds.\n\nHardison's procedure, preparation and rehabilitation cost between $850,000 and $1m, Rodriguez said, about the same as a liver transplant. It was paid for by a university grant.\n\nHe added that the transplant's success bodes well for a future program meant first to help veterans and first-responders who have suffered major injuries.\n\nHardison will return to New York from his home in Senatobia, Mississippi, for regular appointments throughout his recovery."

      "text": "Busted in New York\n\nHow long had it been since I'd been out late on the Lower East Side? Back in the New Wave Bohemian days of the late 1970s and early 80s, the Lower East Side was the capital of mischief. The low life was still literary. I could be persuaded to go anywhere in search of an authentic urban experience. But then my friends grew up, and I moved far away, as Europe seemed to me at the time. Because I don' t drink and run wild any more, because I now live down a dirt track in the English countryside, a Manhattan roomful of the young and the smooth can be intimidating.\n\nBut the reggae club the summer before last was known as a chill lounge. Rona let her hair hang over the beat. We were waiting for Billie. I was telling myself not to have a hard time waiting. I was looking forward to my session with that inner-child finder, marijuana. The reggae swelled around me. My head bobbed like a duck's when there's bread on the water. I saw what looked like a ballet dancer's leg. Billie, and a Billie who knew the score. Her opening drink would not take long. We were going to step outside. We couldn't smoke pot in this reggae club. Not even in a reggae club? That's how long it had been since I'd been out late on the Lower East Side.\n\nStreet lamps threw a spotlight over pedestrians crossing Second Avenue. Killer taxis left unpleasant gusts. I leaned into the summer heat. Soon we three were alone in the dark of Sixth Street. Rona checked behind her. Then, like backup singers on the downbeat, Billie and I snapped glances over our right shoulders. Maybe some people wouldn't have bothered, but we were pros. We were veterans of the streets. Rona fired one up, and we passed it. We were chatting. I hogged it. We were drifting towards midnight. Billie handed it back to Rona. Three shapes in front of a doorway decided to heckle us: \"You're having a good time.\" They sounded like unappetising old kids. We moved to the curb. \"We know what you're doing.\"\n\nRona pushed her hand against the air to let them know that the joke, whatever it was, had to stop. \"Smoke it.\" We shook our heads at their being so boisterous when they were maybe getting high themselves, and in a doorway, of all places. We should have looked ahead instead of behind.\n\nWe saw the corner and we saw the big man in the white-guy plaid shorts cutting a pigeon-toed diagonal from across the street. Everything about him was aimed towards us. His bright white sneakers continued to rise and fall in our direction. A huge meat-packing arm was held out to us, and a big voice was coming at us, too. His other arm came out of his undershirt with a square of ID. We had to keep moving toward him, like something swirling down a drain. There now seemed to be enough light for a film crew's night shoot. How could we have missed the blue unmarked van parked on the other side of Sixth Street?\n\n\"Been smoking something?\" No answer. \"Put your hands flat on the trunk of this car.\" The women, my friends, were side by side at the back of the car. I was on the sidewalk and had to bend over. Other undercovers quickly appeared. \"We're going to empty your pockets.\" A woman had taken up position behind Rona and Billie. I felt a hand go into my pocket. My total financial assets held by a faded money clip hit the trunk of the car. \"Did you all just meet tonight?\" a new voice demanded. \"No.\" My own voice was thin and completely lacking in the authority of outrage. The money clip was followed by a pack of menthol cigarettes, a disposable lighter, a case containing reading glasses, a John Coltrane/Johnny Hartman CD - \"You listen to some good music,\" a head of hair said - and a mobile phone. \"Where's your beeper?\" He patted me down. \"You got a beeper?\" \"No,\" came the thin reply.\n\nThe detectives murmured. They'd found the smallest stub of weed in a matchbox in Rona's pocket. The woman detective left. The detective with the hair asked the ladies to step over to the sidewalk. Where Plaid Shorts had, like me, the beginnings of his father's stomach, this one had pecs and biceps rolling out of a magenta tank top. He looked like a television actor in the role of maverick cop. The rest of him was in the suburban version of casual: crisp bluejeans and clean sneakers.\n\n\"So you guys just met tonight?\" Tank Top asked. It was my turn. He was going to compare answers. Plaid Shorts said he was going over to the van to check something. \"How do you know each other?\" Tank Top demanded. \"School.\" If he identified us as middle class, wouldn't he have to watch himself? Maybe I was trying to prick some white blue-collar resentment, anything to turn the tables a little.\n\nWhen he asked about my bleeper, I thought maybe he hoped he'd interrupted something good, criminally speaking, such as a black dude giving two white chicks a taste of the street herb they were about to buy or get ripped off for. But if he saw that we were OK, then the paperwork on the citation that they give out in these cases would speed up. One black guy with gray in his beard and one and a half white girls, not two, because by that time they must have figured out that Billie's honey skin and the Asian cast to her eyes and her Church of England accent were some weird Caribbean story. Yes, officer, I wanted to explain, the one with the henna highlights is a famous Jewish scientist, the daughter of the British Commonwealth is a banker, and I'm a black guy who needs two pairs of glasses and won't be on your computer lists, not even a credit rating.\n\nBillie and Rona had shown no emotion until Plaid Shorts brought the handcuffs. Then they gave out soft, pastel exclamations. Plaid Shorts led them, affronted and vulnerable, across the street to the side door of the van. I thought, Rona's daughter walks just like her. I felt my watch being removed. Tank Top put my arms behind me and pushed my hands high up my back. I felt the metal around my wrists. I thought of my parents and how they would hurl themselves into this if they found out. I felt and heard the handcuffs lock.\n\nI thought of my parents and their lawsuits. Back in the good old days, they'd sued our hometown police department to force it to desegregate, and when that worked they sued the fire department - things they did in their spare time, as good citizens, as blacks of their generation, members of the NAACP rank and file. Injustice had only to ring their doorbell and they were off to the poorhouse. And there was frivolous me, letting a white man put me in handcuffs for something other than protest. I remembered what my father had said to my tears at my sister's memorial, the year before: \"Keep it together.\"\n\nBut I was in shock. \"I'm going to be sick.\" I was starting to list from side to side. \"Have you been drinking?\" \"No.\" I was going deaf. \"I'm going to pass out.\" Tank Top gripped me just below the right armpit and we started off. But my feet waited before they followed my legs. The world broke into silent, colourful particles. I got to the door and fell flat into the van. Rona's face floated. I began to hear her. I concentrated on finding her face in one place, something I could get up for and move toward, even if only on my knees. \"Don't hurt him,\" Rona and Billie called. \"I'm trying to help him,\" Tank Top countered.\n\nKeep it together, I chanted to myself. Not because I was a black man in handcuffs in front of two white guys; not because I was powerless, which made it all the more necessary at least to imitate the examples of dignity in confrontations with the police which I'd witnessed; and not because I was a grown man losing it in front of two women who, though in handcuffs, were trying to defend me. But because they were my friends. They were the ones with children at home. I crawled over to my friends in the seatless, windowless rear of the van, dripping sweat on them.\n\nPlaid Shorts yanked the van into the street. Because we couldn't grab, and there was nothing to grab on to, we rolled into Alice-down-the-rabbit-hole positions and rolled again when Plaid Shorts hit the gas. \"This is such bullshit,\" Billie said to the ceiling. \"This sucks,\" Plaid Shorts said, but he wasn't talking to us. He looked across at Tank Top. \"You got that right.\" \"A big one,\" Plaid Shorts added. \"Hate it,\" Tank Top said to his window. \"Total bullshit.\" Rona had dusted off her repertoire of apt facial expressions. This one said, \"Are these guys for real?\" \"Five years, man and I'm out,\" Plaid Shorts said. \"I just can't wait to do my band.\" He did a near wheelie around a corner. We shouldered back up into sitting positions pretty expertly after two corners. Tank Top took some gum from the dashboard and said he had to keep at this bullshit until he could pay off his wife. He told Plaid Shorts that instead of alimony he was offering his wife a once-in-a-lifetime, can't-refuse lump sum. \"It's like a buyout.\"\n\nThe acid-driven power chords of Pink Floyd took over the van. Rona's expression said, \"These guys are too much.\" \"They're wild,\" Billie's eyes said back as she looked for the place behind her where the music was blaring from. Maybe the detectives were trying to tell us something. Not that they were nice guys who regrettably had to do their job but that they were better than the job they'd been reduced to doing, and that they too had aspirations. The Rolling Stones came on next, and Plaid Shorts sang along. The music was perhaps meant to say that they weren't uncool, redneck cops having a blast at the expense of the liberal, the black, and the in-between.\n\nI was too ashamed to be sympathetic. Being addressed as \"sir\" by Tank Top only after I had shown weakness and fear - that was humiliating. A cop could go off at any time. I'd thought of that and had been afraid, and there was no way to take it back. And for what had I lost my self-respect? For an offence the detectives thought beneath their training. What did you do last night? Oh I was picked up for a reefer and I fainted like a man. The van went up one street and down another. We couldn't see much, but most likely we were driving around and around as various undercover operations didn't work out. On one dark corner we waited so long in the van by ourselves that we almost slept.\n\nThe van door slid open, and in the shaft of light Tank Top was helping a Hispanic woman, maybe in her 50s, climb aboard the bummer bus. \"Hey, officer,\" she said when we were under way. \"My hands are too hot.\" The detectives parked and helped Rona and Billie out. Tank Top said, \"I'm going to loosen these tight cuffs, like you asked.\" Then he turned off the lights, slammed the door, and left me with this woman who made unsavoury sounds in the dark. I thought she was trying to ditch her vials of crack and the detectives would then claim they were mine. I went over on my side, practising the I-was-asleep defence. They put Rona and Billie back in the van, turned on the lights, drove off, stopped again, and got out by themselves. As soon as the doors closed, the Hispanic woman, who had freed her hands, whipped out a big bag of heroin, snorted it on her knees, and deftly worked her hands back into the cuffs. Rona was laughing in disbelief. Quietly, the Hispanic woman zoned sidewise. The detectives, when they got back in, firmly looked straight ahead.\n\nThe next time the van door opened, a Hispanic man, maybe also in his 50s, climbed in. A dark Rasta youth was pushed in after him. \"Ooh,\" the Hispanic guy said, and tried to shift himself. He nodded greetings of solidarity. What he'd been oohing about hit Rona's hygiene radar first. It made delicate Billie draw in her legs. The gleaming Rasta youth sprawled before us had matted dreadlocks that looked like what comes from the back of a furnace when its filter is changed. Maybe I should have thought harder about this being someone's son, but the stench was overpowering. Meanwhile, he kept up a stream of Babylon raas claat denunciations of the police. He shouted curses on the white man. I thought, Rasta, my brother in the Garvey, you are on your own. The detectives paid him no mind. They'd made their quota for the shift.\n\nWe'd been smoking a joint right around the corner from the local precinct house, that's how hip we were. The detectives took us inside and the handcuffs came off. After three hours, it was a relief to see my fingers. Tank Top took me and the Rasta youth upstairs to a grotty corridor, and the strip search began. He made the Rasta youth wait in the shadows at the end. He ordered me to hand him my clothes item by item. I was to turn around, bend over, and drop my shorts. He said quickly that that was enough. I was to take off my socks and turn them inside out. \"Get dressed.\" He asked if I'd ever been arrested. No. He said he would try to tell me what was going to happen. I thought I understood. He motioned to the Rasta and sent me downstairs. He and the Rasta followed moments later. Tank Top had returned my property, except for the phone and the CD. Such stuff had to go to the lockup at Central, he explained. If that was the case, then the Rasta youth had a prayer shawl and a Torah for Central to deal with. Tank Top tried to talk when he took my fingerprints. \"So what kind of things do you write?\" After that, he had paperwork to finish. Now and then, he would dial a telephone number, mutter, hang up, and shrug. A clock kept vigil over a wall of \"Most wanted\" leaflets.\n\nWhen Plaid Shorts announced that we were moving around five o'clock in the morning, the Hispanic man asked how much money I had on me. I'd covered the money clip with my hand when Tank Top passed it to me, but clearly, I hadn't been quick enough. The Hispanic man said I couldn't bring in anything where we were going, because it would get taken off me. He informed Plaid Shorts, who agreed that I'd get robbed. Rona put my belongings, even my glasses, in her pocket. My property would be safer in the woman's section, the Hispanic man advised as we were put back into handcuffs and then linked to one another. I was made to lead our daisy chain of handcuffs through the precinct's main room. As Plaid Shorts increased the pace, two officers by the front door erupted into grunting song. \"Working on the chain gang, uh.\"\n\nWe hopped out of the van into a street that was still dark. A semicircle of light waited for us to approach. This was the Tombs, that place I'd heard about, read about. Two more daisy chains of prisoners joined ours as Tank Top, having rung twice, banged on the metal grating over the entrance. It rolled up. Plaid Shorts and Tank Top surrendered us in a series of rapid clipboard signatures. When I realised that they intended to abandon us at this concrete threshold, I wanted to ask them when they planned to read us our rights. I'd begun to think of them as our undercovers. They were responsible for us. But they were gone, and we were across the line, and the metal grating was coming down.\n\nI followed a black female corrections officer's rump up some stairs. A black male corrections officer unhooked everybody. My eyes stayed on Rona and Billie when they were ordered to move to the other side of the corridor. The women went in one direction, the men in another. Green bars streamed along either side of me as I hurried both to keep up with the corrections officer who was now taking us down to the basement and to keep ahead of someone whose footsteps menaced my heel.\n\nThe Rasta youth and I were directed into the last cell of the long jail. I insinuated myself on to the narrow metal bench that went from the bars of the cell to the rear wall, where it made a right angle toward the partition that hid the toilet. Nine mute, tired faces emphasised how cramped and stuffy the tiny cell was. One man was curled up asleep under the bench.\n\nI didn't want to look too intently at the other men in judicial storage, in case to do so meant something I could not handle the consequences of. I also didn't want to look away too quickly when my gaze happened to meet someone else's. However, no one was interested in hassling the new arrivals. Men were waking up, and their banter competed with the locker-room-type noise coming from the corrections officers' oblong station desk. A short white girl with thick glasses and a rolling lectern called my name. She said the interview was to determine who was eligible for bail, but the questions also separated the wheat from the chaff, socioeconomically speaking. Some guys probably had no job, no taxable weekly income, no address, no mother's address. She lost patience with the Rasta youth's decent background. \"Education? How far did you get in school?\" A community college degree. Her head was tilted up toward the spectacle of his hair. \"We'll say grade 15.\"\n\nSome time later, the Rasta youth and I were summoned again. But again we were going only a few yards. A black corrections officer shooed aside someone blocking the door of the new cell, which was large and, sneaked glances told me, held some huge dudes. Fresh apprehension was bringing my body to something like exocrine parity with the Rasta youth's. I didn't know what to expect, and so tried to prepare for the worst. We were shoulder to shoulder on a metal bench, like crows shuffling on a telephone wire. The move to this restless population had to be the final, dangerous descent, the reason I'd crammed my watch into my glasses case and handed everything off to Rona.\n\nA black youth with his hair in tight break braids called out to a new arrival, my Hispanic comrade. \"Come on in.\" The black youth's knuckles looked as big as Mike Tyson's. \"They took the murderers out early.\" He slapped five with a couple of his hulking neighbours and concerned himself with what he could see of his reflection in the metal bench between his thighs. He said something more. I didn't hear what it was, but it must have been wicked.\n\nA black corrections officer reversed himself and glared through the green bars. \"What?\" \"Nothing, Mo,\" the black youth said loudly, evenly. Only one of his neighbours giggled. \"Say what, chump?\" He was going for the keys at his hip. \"You say something?\" He was so agitated that he couldn't get his key in. He was as tall as a basketball power forward. Everything he said was a variation of \"You want to say something?\" The cell door flew open, and in a few steps the corrections officer was over the massive head of twinkling black braids. \"A real man would say something now.\" He waited for an answer. I could see him shaking. The black youth wasn't going to feed him any lines or provocation. The corrections officer pivoted towards the door. He had a baton on his belt, but no gun. He made a satisfied noise with his keys.\n\nIt was not an impressive performance. I knew that. The corrections officer hadn't come up with any good lines. He just kept repeating himself. I could tell that all 24 of my cellmates were thinking how off the hook the corrections officer had been to raise up - the lingo was coming to me - on somebody like that. I was getting excited, feeling that I was on the verge of bonding with the other guys in our high and hip judgment against the corrections officer. He didn't meet our rigorous standards when it came to \"reading\" someone on the street manner. The black youth with the oiled, sparkling braids delivered our verdict: \"Definitely bugging behind something.\"\n\nThe black corrections officer flung the metal door so hard it bounced against the cell bars and rode back some. Giant steps put him in a place that blocked my view of the black youth. Spit was dancing from his head, pinwheel fashion, as he roared, \"If I started to kick your black ass now, where would your black ass be next week?\" I couldn't remember when I had seen such sudden rage. It stopped all other activity in the basement. The tendons in his neck were ready to explode. I couldn't begin to think what his nostrils might be doing. Maybe our survival molecules were not the only ones to have been put on alert. Some of his colleagues had come by to monitor the situation. They turned back in a way that indicated they'd respect some code not to interfere. The cell was very still as the corrections officer made his exit. The street judgment was in the silence. Nobody wanted to look at him until he'd made his point. He had shown how dangerous was his longing to have a reason to lose control.\n\nThe corrections officer's brown skin looked glazed, as though it had been fired in a kiln. He didn't seem to know how to finish his scene and stood wheezing by the bars. I almost thought he was going to mellow into the dispersal of balm-and-poultice phase of tough love. The mask of the shock-tactics practitioner would drop. He'd apologise, give advice, tell the young brothers how he was once on his way to being where they were. The black corrections officer said: \"Remember. I'll be going home at four o'clock. You'll still be here. You're in jail. I'm not.\"\n\nMaybe I should have taken into account the possibility that he had seen and had a lot of trouble doing his job. Maybe he and the black youth already had a story going and I'd missed what started it. But that didn't matter. Only what he'd said about four o'clock mattered. It wasn't even nine o'clock in the morning yet. My Hispanic comrade was looking at me. He took his eyes heavenward and clasped his hands. Then he shot me an inaudible laugh.\n\nRead part II of this story\n\nDarryl Pinckney is the author of the novel High Cotton (Faber & Faber) and is currently working on a book about modern African-American literature which will be published next year.

      "text": "An Unarmed Hispanic Man Was Sitting In His Car - Then Police Fatally Shot Him\n\nSocial Justice Reporter\n\nBefore leaving his mother's home earlier this month, Derek Diaz turned around and said, \"Mom, I love you.\"\n\n\"That was the last time anyone saw him,\" Sonja Nava, the mother of Diaz's child, told HuffPost.\n\nThe next day, July 3, Orlando police officers approached Diaz, 26, while he was sitting inside his parked car. Not even a minute passed before an officer fatally shot Diaz.\n\nDiaz's family members gathered at his mother's home to watch the body camera footage of the shooting. His mother, Yaneri Diaz, showed family members all of his old report cards - she had kept all of her son's things since preschool. She cried in the background before collecting herself and speaking to HuffPost over the phone.\n\n\"I am very angry, very upset,\" Yaneri Diaz said from the gathering. \"I want to see [the officer's] face and ask him: Why did he do that to him? ... I want the officer that killed my son, I want him to pay. I want him to go to jail.\"\n\nDerek Diaz's brother, Jordan Claxton, remembered Diaz as someone who loved playing basketball, getting on TikTok and grabbing a bite to eat with their family. Diaz had gotten his Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning certification last year, and had started a new job a few months later.\n\nDiaz was born in Queens, New York, and lived in New Jersey for a few years. He had been living in Orlando for the last two years, his family said.\n\nNava said she is worried about how their 5-year-old daughter will grow up now that her father has been killed by police, and she said she hopes there will be accountability for the officer who shot Diaz.\n\n\"I think the way the officers handled the situation, they did not handle it the best way they could have,\" she said. \"It could have been prevented with better police training.\"\n\nThe Orlando Police Department released body camera footage of the fatal encounter Wednesday afternoon following demands from Diaz's family and national civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing the family.\n\nThe footage shows an officer riding his bicycle past several parked cars before approaching Diaz, who was sitting inside one of the vehicles with his window down. The officer shouts at Diaz to turn off his car and music.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replies Diaz, who is holding his cellphone and balls of aluminum foil.\n\nThe officer demands Diaz hand him the foil. He replies \"My bad\" and hands over the foil. The officer then tells Diaz to put his hands on the steering wheel, which he does.\n\nDiaz lifts his hand from the wheel and begins to move it toward a compartment in the vehicle but stops. The officer yells, \"Put your hands on the wheel!\" while taking a step back and seemingly firing a shot simultaneously.\n\nThe officer runs backward from the car, and the body camera shows that another officer is on the scene. The second officer asks if someone had fired their gun. \"Yeah, I did,\" the first officer replies.\n\nWith guns pointed at the car, officers yell at Diaz to show his hands. But as they approach the vehicle, they see Diaz slumped over in the driver's seat, unresponsive.\n\nPolice pull him out of the car and try to administer aid, but Diaz remains unresponsive.\n\nHe was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\n\nPolice did not find a weapon on Diaz or in the car.\n\nThe Orlando Police Department identified the officer as Jose Velez, who served with the department for three years.\n\nOrlando Police Chief Eric D. Smith said in a news conference officers were patrolling the area to \"remove illegal drugs and crime guns off our streets.\"\n\nIn a statement released with the body-worn camera footage, police said Diaz tossed an object out of the car window that was later discovered to be narcotics. It is not clear from the bodycam footage whether Diaz threw anything from the car.\n\nThe police department did not immediately respond to HuffPost's request for additional comment.\n\nDiaz's family is now focused on justice. They also said they believe Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) should acknowledge the tragedy of their son's death. DeSantis' office did not respond to a request for comment on the shooting.\n\nDeSantis and Monique Worrell, the state attorney in the Orlando area, have been at odds for months , as DeSantis has criticized the prosecutor for not pursuing certain types of crimes such as sex trafficking.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Los Angeles Archbishop Is First Hispanic Man Elected To Lead U.S. Catholic Bishops\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) - Archbishop José Gómez of Los Angeles, an immigrant from Mexico, overwhelmingly won an election Tuesday as the first Hispanic to head the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\nGómez, 67, has been the conference's vice president for the past three years. He is considered a practical-minded conservative when it comes to church doctrine but is a strong advocate of a welcoming immigration policy that would include a path to citizenship for many immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.\n\nIn August, after a gunman targeting Mexicans killed 22 people at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, Gómez wrote a powerful statement condemning white supremacy and noting that Spanish was spoken in North America before English.\n\nGómez succeeds Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, archbishop of Galveston-Houston, whose presidency was complicated by the church's clergy sex-abuse crisis.\n\nFollowing the election of Gómez, the bishops chose Detroit Archbishop Allen Vigneron, 71, as the new vice president. By tradition, that puts him in line to become president in three years.\n\nLike Gómez, Vigneron has criticized some U.S. policies he deemed hostile to immigrants, but he is considered a staunch conservative on most issues.\n\nGomez was born in Monterrey, Mexico, and studied theology at the University of Navarra in Spain. He was ordained an Opus Dei priest in 1978 and worked in the Galveston-Houston area and in Denver before being named archbishop of San Antonio in 2004. He become archbishop of Los Angeles in 2011.\n\n\"Archbishop Gomez is a quiet pastor with a powerful voice for immigrants,\" said John Gehring, Catholic program director at a Washington-based clergy network called Faith in Public Life. \"The first Latino to lead Catholic bishops at a time when the Trump administration is attacking immigrants won't be afraid to call out racism and nativism.\"\n\nThe Catholic bishops, at their three-day conference that ends Wednesday, are expected to authorize development of a \"comprehensive vision\" for Hispanic ministry, to be completed over the next few years.\n\nWhile Hispanics account for about 37% of all U.S. Catholics, they are no longer a majority-Catholic group, according to the Pew Research Center. A recent Pew survey said 47% of Hispanics in the U.S. now call themselves Catholic, down from 57% in 2009.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "The Latin Way\n\nNational organization dedicated to fighting heart disease and stroke.\n\nBy Dr. Juan Rivera As a cardiovascular prevention specialist, I am constantly searching for ways to improve my patients' health education, lifestyle and quality of life. My job transcends the clinical realm though. As Univision's Chief Medical Correspondent, I have the responsibility, as I see it, to use my media platform to literally improve the health outcome of the Latino community. I spend countless hours thinking about developing and delivering culturally sensitive content for my audience. Learning about which TV segments stick and make a difference versus those which don't is a personal obsession of mine. It is the holy grail of effective communication and it gets to the core of human behavior.\n\nThe answer unexpectedly came to me during a routine clinical office visit. A Latin couple, in their 50s, was sitting in front of me. It was immediately obvious that the husband was not there voluntarily. The only words coming out of his mouth were: \"Doctor, I don't know what I am doing here. I am fine\". The woman, a well-dressed, talkative, decisive Cubana, immediately took charge. \"You are here because your father and your brother died of heart disease. You are not dying on me... and you will do what I'll tell you to do.\" My initial thought was \"Damn, you go girl!\" But I was immediately intimidated as well. And that was my eureka moment... any Hispanic man, no matter how \"macho man\" he thinks he is, cannot fight the amazing strength and will of a Latina.\n\nLatinas are the north star of our community and the hope for healthier generations. They organize our lives, take care of us when we fall ill, and represent the will power that keeps our families thriving and moving forward. In the case of the above mentioned couple, after a detailed work up, I discovered that the man had severe atherosclerosis and was in need of significant lifestyle changes as well as medication to prevent a fatal event. To this date, I believe that she saved his life. He never misses an appointment.\n\nIf we want to have a chance to improve cardiovascular outcomes in the Latino community, we have to center our efforts on the heads of the families, Latinas. That being said, it is also important to understand that they will take care of everyone around them before attending to their own needs. As a man married to one, I have experienced their amazing altruism. But for the benefit of our community, that has to change.\n\nLatinas need to understand that approximately 43 million women in the United States suffer from cardiovascular disease, as stated by the American Heart Association's Go Red For Women movement. Since 1984, more women than men have died of heart disease each year. Only 44 percent of Latinas know that heart disease represents the number one cause of death for them. Unfortunately, their symptoms are often dismissed by health care professionals in part due to a horrible stigma that Latinas, and women in general, are more \"hysterical\", \"unable to handle stress\" or more \"expressive\" -- a term used to imply that they exaggerate their symptoms. Heart attacks are also often misdiagnosed because the symptoms tend to be atypical. While most people think that a crushing, pressure-like, left-sided chest pain is the hallmark of a myocardial event, women can present with fatigue, right arm pain, shortness of breath, or a burning chest pain.\n\nLatinas can make a difference for themselves and their families. Here is how:\n\n1. Schedule a yearly Cardiovascular Prevention work up for you and your husband. It is important to check for blood sugar (diabetes is very prevalent in our community), high blood pressure, high cholesterol and obesity indicators. Ask your doctor about tests to detect occult plaque in your coronary and carotid arteries. And most importantly, do not ignore your symptoms!\n\n2. Make cooking a healthy family experience. Insist that your husband and kids get involved as opposed to allowing them to watch TV or play video games while you do all the work. Introduce new vegetables, healthier whole grain carbohydrates and good fats into the meals. Talk about the importance of a healthy diet to prevent disease and for the kids' physical and mental development.\n\n3. Get your family off of the couch! Involve them in regular physical activity.\n\n4. Be the sleep custodian of the house. Sleeping less than seven hours a day is associated with increased mortality, obesity and cardiovascular risk.\n\n5. Smile and stay positive! You have a way of smiling and celebrating life that is contagious. Happiness is one of the best preventive therapies!\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "On Newt Gingrich's Warm-Up Music at His \"Hispanic Town Hall Meeting\" at Don Quijote Restaurant, Manchester, NH\n\nAuthor of Life in the Loop: Essays on OCD.\n\nThe first time that the Gingrich campaign played Joe Esposito's \"You're the Best,\" (viz. Karate Kid ) I thought, This is going to be all right. After all, that song is boss.\n\nThis isn't true of most of the songs you hear at campaign rallies. And there's a reason for this: songs at campaign events tend not to be selected because they are good, but because they either a) are so bland as to have no chance of offending anyone born after 1911, or b) contain lots of lyrics about how awesome America is, and how much the singer loves it (especially the little things, like apple pie and WD-40 (really). At yesterday's Gingrich event, Type B was the more popular of the two.\n\nI suppose I was a little surprised (but not upset) that the Gingrich campaign hadn't loaded up on Hispanic music -- I think it might have heightened the awkwardness of an event at which almost all of the attendees (including the media) were white and almost all of the restaurant employees were Hispanic.\n\nStill, the songs they chose weren't much better. (And by the way, Gingrich campaign -- it's time to throw a few more songs on your playlist; the third time I heard \"You're the Best,\" I began having doubts about whether Joe Esposito really was the best recording artist of the 1980s.)\n\nThe thing is, no one really likes Ameri-rock, because most of it isn't meant to be enjoyed (at least not primarily). Instead, it's meant to make a point. And that point is: America is super-cool, and I feel really sentimental about it -- do you hear the orchestral buildup and the nostalgically yearning guitars?\n\nAnd I'm down with that -- I'm down with recognizing America's greatness and getting in touch with the profundity of citizenship. I've had some seriously deep moments looking up at the flag with my fellow Americans, hands over hearts.\n\nBut that's a special kind of civic space, and you can't just create it at will. And you definitely can't throw on some third-rate Bocephus wannabe and then try to associate the whole incompletely-created-mood with your campaign. It feels fake and dissonant and manipulative.\n\nWhich is a particularly weird thing from Gingrich, given how little interest he displays in glad-handing and sentimentalizing. (Whatever else you can say about him, he's not super-heavy on the pandering.) At today's event, for example, an Hispanic man praised Gingrich profusely for his \"character\" and his views on immigration. The man spoke passionately, pounding his own chest for emphasis. Gingrich responded with almost no emotion at all, as if he were teaching a seminar and the end of the semester were near.\n\nSo maybe the Gingrich camp needs a different kind of theme music -- something more in keeping with the man himself. Given Gingrich's poll numbers, though, Joe Esposito's timeless lyrics might be just the thing to buoy his spirits:\n\nTry to be best'Cause you're only a manAnd a man's gotta learn to take it\n\nTry to believeThough the going gets roughThat you gotta hang tough to make it\n\nHistory repeats itselfTry and you'll succeed\n\nNever doubt that you're the oneAnd you can have your dreams!\n\nYou're the best!Around!Nothing's gonna ever keep you downYou're the Best!Around!Nothing's gonna ever keep you downYou're the Best!Around!Nothing's gonna ever keep you dow-ow-ow-ow-own"

      "text": "Fox News, Far-Right Podcasters Sued For Linking Wrong Man To Neo-Nazi Shooting\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nA group of media organizations and far-right podcasters were hit with a libel lawsuit last month after sharing an image of a man they wrongly identified as a neo-Nazi mass shooter.\n\nTexas man Mauricio Garcia, 36, alleges several media organizations, including Fox News and Newsmax, used an image of him in their coverage of a mass shooting last year that falsely linked him to the real shooter.\n\nThe real gunman - a 33-year-old white supremacist who killed eight people and wounded seven others at an outlet mall in Allen, Texas before he was fatally shot by police - shares the same name as the plaintiff.\n\n\"In their haste to cash in on the eagerness of viewers and readers to learn the identity of the May 6, 2023 mass shooter at the outlet mall in Allen, Texas, several media organizations recklessly disregarded basic journalistic safeguards and published the photo of an innocent man, branding him as a neo-Nazi murderer to his local community and the nation at large,\" the lawsuit, filed March 26 and obtained by HuffPost, alleges.\n\nAmong the defendants accused of sharing the innocent man's photo are far-right podcasters Tim Pool and Steven Crowder, along with Infowars host Owen Shroyer. Other media organizations named as defendants include the conservative cable channels Fox News and Newsmax; entertainment blog Hollywood Unlocked, TelevisaUnivision, the parent company of Spanish-language broadcaster Univision; and foreign policy news site Today News Africa.\n\nThe lawsuit says the news organizations misidentified the shooter between May 7 and May 9.\n\nFox News, for instance, is accused of publishing 36-year-old Garcia's image on FoxNews.com in a story about the gunman.\n\n\"Fox News Network, LLC refused to publish a retraction within 30 days,\" the lawsuit says. \"Indeed, no retraction has ever been published. Fox completely ignored Plaintiff and never responded.\"\n\nYou can read the full lawsuit here.\n\nHuffPost reached out to the defendants in the case but did not receive a response back.\n\nGarcia is being represented by Mark Bankston of the law firm Farrar & Ball, as well as attorney Greg Adler.\n\nBankston previously represented two Sandy Hook parents who won $45 million in damages against conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, after Jones spent years falsely claiming the 2012 school shooting never happened on his Infowars show. Bankston is also currently representing a 22-year-old Jewish man who alleges he was falsely linked to a neo-Nazi brawl by billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nGarcia's lawsuit contains a letter his mom sent to a Univision journalist after she saw her son's photo on the network. The letter, written in Spanish, said her son's \"only sin was to be called the same Mauricio Garcia,\" according to the lawyers' translation.\n\n\"They have made a very serious mistake, they have destroyed my life and that of my family, Mauricio's grandfather, my son was scared to death!!!\" she wrote. \"I am going to send you the photo that is my son and I have received death threats and hatred!!!\"\n\nFollowing the shooting, details began to trickle in about the real gunman's identity.\n\nMauricio Garcia, 33, wore a patch during the shooting with the letters \"RWDS,\" or \"Right Wing Death Squad\" on it - a common sight at extremist gatherings, including at the deadly neo-Nazi rallies in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017. And posts from the gunman on Russian social media revealed he had a large swastika tattoo .\n\n\"We do know that he had neo-Nazi ideation,\" Hank Sibley, North Texas regional director for the Texas Department of Public Safety, said at a press conference following the massacre. \"He had patches. He had tattoos. Even his signature verified that.\"\n\nDespite evidence of the gunman's neo-Nazi beliefs, many on the right - including Musk - dismissed the idea that the shooting could've been motivated by right-wing extremism, instead suggesting it was a government conspiracy.\n\nOne of those people was Tim Pool, a beanie-wearing podcaster who has hosted white supremacist Nick Fuentes and right-wing troll Milo Yiannopoulos on his show.\n\nWhen discussing the shooter's social media profile on his program, \"Timcast IRL,\" Pool said: \"You see, here's where we get into the psyop,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\n\"No one knows if this Russian social media profile is actually - actually belongs to this guy,\" Pool said, the suit alleges. \"Now the photos that are coming out, ... they don't show his face.\"\n\nPool added that he didn't want to show photos of the potential shooter \"considering the sensitive nature of these things,\" the lawsuit says. But Pool's media group had already published a photo of a different man - the plaintiff Garcia - on its website, according to the suit.\n\nPool's company, Timcast Media Group, is listed as a defendant.\n\n\"Despite Plaintiff's demand, Timcast Media Group, Inc. refused to publish a retraction within 30 days,\" the lawsuit says. \"Indeed, despite acknowledging Plaintiff's demand and deleting the articles, no retraction has ever been published.\"\n\nAccording to the suit, Pool wasn't alone in publishing the wrong photo while also claiming the shooting was a government conspiracy. Shroyer, who served prison time for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack , allegedly showed a photo of the wrong Garcia on his Infowars program, \"The War Room With Owen Shroyer.\"\n\nMore from the lawsuit:\n\nWhile showing innocent Plaintiff Mauricio Garcia's photograph, Shroyer stated: \"They're the ones who call a Hispanic man a white supremacist and a neo-Nazi. His name was Mauricio Garcia, your neo-Nazi [laugh] white supremacist. But we know now, this is the Leftist logic, we know now that it actually has nothing to do with skin color.

One of the men, 38-year-old Scott Leader , told police he was inspired by presidential candidate Donald Trump's message on immigration.\n\n\"Donald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported,\" Leader allegedly told cops when he was arrested with his brother, 30-year-old Steve Leader.\n\nThe Boston Globe reported that a witness saw the brothers beating the 58-year-old victim with a pole three or four times as he attempted to defend himself.\n\nThis isn't the first time the Leader brothers have been charged with a crime. After the attacks on September 11, Scott Leader was convicted with a hate crime after he assaulted a Muslim man and called him a \"terrorist.\"\n\nWhen Trump heard about the assault, he told the Globe, \"It would be a shame...I will say that people who are following me are very passionate. They love this country and they want this country to be great again. They are passionate.\"\n\nTrump, who is currently leading the GOP presidential field, set the tone for his campaign in June when he said that Mexican immigrants were criminals and rapists.\n\nSince launching his bid, Trump has continued to issue offensive comments about Latin American immigrants. Earlier this week, he offered a glimpse at his immigration plan, which promotes mass deportations and an end to birthright citizenship .\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The Racially Charged San Francisco Police Shooting You Don't Know About But Should\n\nPeople gathered at a vigil for Mario Woods on December 3, 2015 Jaeah Lee\n\nDozens of people gathered at a candlelit vigil on Thursday night in San Francisco, at the spot where 26-year-old Mario Woods was killed by police the day before. Woods, who is black, died in a hail of bullets fired by San Francisco Police Department officers on Wednesday afternoon in the city's Bayview district. Police identified him as the suspect in an attack whose victim was apparently stabbed in the shoulder but is expected to survive. Police officials said Woods was wielding a kitchen knife that he refused to relinquish even as officers ordered him to drop it, fired bean bag pellets, and pepper-sprayed him.\n\nThe moments leading up to the shooting were captured on several widely circulated videos recorded on cellphones. In one, Woods can be seen standing with his back against a wall, surrounded by police whose guns are drawn. When Woods begins to walk away, an officer steps in his path, and within seconds a series of shots rings out. SFPD Chief Greg Suhr told reporters that a total of five officers opened fire. ( Warning: graphic images )\n\nA video posted by HotRod (@daniggahot) on Dec 2, 2015 at 4:59pm PST\n\nWoods died at the scene. A resident who lives next to the site of the shooting told Mother Jones that he counted at least 36 shell casings on the sidewalk after the violence was over. Another angle also captured the shooting (graphic).\n\nAnother angle from yesterday's police shooting in Bayview (SF)\n\nThis was taken by one of my students who lives a block away.\n\nPosted by Larry Salomon on Thursday, December 3, 2015\n\nSF Weekly reported that Woods had been a gang member in 2009 and had previously served prison and jail time for possession of a firearm by a felon. Woods' mother, Gwendolyn, told ABC7 News that her son had suffered from mental health issues but was getting through them. \"He just needed some help,\" she said. \"He fought past them. \" She told interviewers that her son had \"gotten his uniform\" for his new job with the United Parcel Service that he was slated to begin the day after he died .\n\nThe San Francisco police department has had a troubled history of police aggression and racism toward minority communities. In February, four San Francisco police officers were cleared in the shooting death of Alex Niet o, a 28-year-old Hispanic man who was shot 10 to 15 times by police in March 2014. Police officers mistook a Taser for a gun. In March, a series of racist and homophobic text messages sent among a group of officers in 2011 and 2012 emerged as part of a federal case against a former San Francisco police sergeant convicted of corruption charges, according to the San Francisco Chronicle . The department tried to fire eight officers and suspend several others involved, but the disciplinary process is ongoing. In August, a video of more than a dozen San Francisco police officers surrounding and tackling a disabled homeless man went viral, spurring outrage.\n\nNeighborhood residents where Woods was shot questioned the level of force used to subdue him.\n\n\"They had six officers against this one little guy,\" area resident Cedric Smith told the San Francisco Chronicle . \"They could have used batons. They could have backed off. They didn't need to shoot him.\" And Chemika Hollis, another resident, wondered why police officers shot him so many times. \"How can you feel a threat when you have 10 cops around you?\" she said.\n\nThursday's vigil was set up on the spot where Woods was gunned down, with pictures of him, candles, and a sign posted to the wall reading, \"Black Lives Matter.\" A few blocks away from the vigil, dozens more gathered at a community meeting in the St. Paul of the Shipwreck Catholic church, while others held a peaceful protest outside.\n\nSan Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr has said the officers were justified in shooting Woods, and he promised a thorough investigation.\n\n\"It's a tragic loss anytime somebody dies. We never want to do that,\" he told reporters after the shooting. \"But this is all they could do. I really don't know how much more you can make it plain to a wanted felon that he should drop the knife.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Want economic recovery? Start by supporting the Latina workforce\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nLatina Equal Pay Day is an observance and call to action that brings awareness to an issue that affects not just Latinas, but the entire American economy.\n\nThe Equal Pay Act passed almost 60 years ago, making it illegal to pay anyone less based on their gender or race. Unfortunately this problem persists, but for Hispanic women in particular, the gap only gets wider.\n\nFor a Latina to reach pay parity with a white non-Hispanic man, she would need to work past the age of 90 (6 years beyond her life expectancy). This is obviously unrealistic, which means there is no real way for her to ever catch up!\n\nWhen I first learned about the pay gap, I was shocked. Growing up in Mexico, we had much more pay transparency with published wage scales, so we all knew how much everyone made.\n\nSuperstar employees could always qualify for bonuses, but even those had a clear and transparent way of being measured. When I first came to this country, I was surprised at the secrecy around pay. Thirty years later, it's disappointing to see how little progress we've made.\n\nLatinas have the largest pay gap among women, and sadly, it is the widest gap we've ever seen. This year it dropped to $.54 cents to the dollar for all Latina workers and $.49 cents for those in full-time jobs.\n\nAccording to Monica Ramirez, who founded Justice for Migrant Women , she explained that the disparity accounts for all Latinas with reported earnings:\n\n\"We set the date for December 8th because per the 2020 census data, that reflected a $.49 cent to $1 dollar gap - we would not have had a day of action for Latinas in 2022, or 'best case' per one calculation, it would have been on New Years Eve. We could not let a year go by without acting as a collective, raising awareness and addressing the solutions ... 33 million women's experiences overall are accounted for. We did not want to erase the experiences of part-time workers, gig workers, seasonal workers, etc. We also can't appropriately address a problem if we don't understand its scope.\"\n\nTo address the scope of this problem, we must acknowledge the economic weight that Latinas bear in order to keep the U.S. economy competitive. Before the pandemic, their numbers in the labor force were projected to grow by almost 26 percent , significantly outpacing that of white women.\n\nUnfortunately, this cohort was devastated by the pandemic, not just among deaths but also in economic hardship. According to the National Women's Law Center , 324,000 Latinas were forced to leave the workforce in September 2020 - almost three times the rate of white women, and more than four times the rate of Black women. Taken together, Latinas are now on track to lose on average $1.2 million in their productive careers, but in states like California, which has the highest Hispanic population, the loss jumps to $1.8 million .\n\nFor some, unconscious bias might suggest this wage gap persists because Latinas only work in low-wage service jobs, but the disparity actually becomes wider among Latinas with bachelor's and advanced degrees compared to those with a high school diploma.\n\nThe same is true even among the highest paid jobs held by Latinas. For example, those who work in legal occupations make on average $66,201 a year compared to their non-Hispanic white male counterparts who earn $156,908 annually for the same job.\n\nWhile the global pandemic clearly exacerbated this gap, Latinas and their families were hardest hit by a year of record inflation , according to recent estimates from the New York Fed. Their share of income spent on basic goods and services - transportation, housing, food - far outpaced their average income growth.\n\nIf we consider that potentially 30 million Latinas in this country will each stand to lose $1.2 million in their productive careers as a result of wage inequities, that amounts to $36 trillion in lost economic power.\n\nNow imagine if a third of that went to taxes - that's approximately $10 trillion that Latinas will not be able to contribute directly to schools, healthcare, parks, social security - measures that would benefit us all.\n\nThis massive wage gap also cripples Latinas from the ability to build generational wealth and potentially close the gap entirely. For instance, if Latinas invested the money they are not appropriately getting paid (on average $30K yearly), over the course of 40 years with the average return of the stock market just above 10 percent (S&P 500 index), their $1.2 million could turn into $13.2 million per Latina with compound interest.\n\nBut despite the headwinds so many Latinas face, their drive to overcome prevails. They are the primary decision-makers in their homes, they are increasingly more educated, and they are starting businesses at an accelerated rate on minimal capital.\n\nOn this day of action, let's be intentional in supporting their growth. Here's how:\n\nIf you support equal pay, make your voice heard. Participate in the many live and virtual activations from the U.S. Capital to the United Nations. Even when most women and their allies have been able to make small improvements toward pay equity, we will not have true equity until ALL women are paid the same.\n\nBeatriz Acevedo is a leading voice among Latina entrepreneurs in the United States. A proud immigrant from Mexico, she is the CEO and co-founder of Suma Wealth and serves as president of the Acevedo Foundation.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

He was not released immediately, but his attorneys expected him to walk free later in the day.\n\nRELATED: Lewis Fogle freed by DNA after serving 34 years for teen's murder\n\nDNA tests found that the crimes Vargas was convicted of were actually committed by the so-called Teardrop Rapist, who is known for a tattoo of a teardrop under his eye, said Chris Saunders, a spokesman for the California Innocence Project at California Western School of Law, which took up Vargas' case in 2012.\n\nWitnesses linked Vargas to the crime because he had a similar tattoo.\n\nThe Teardrop Rapist is on the FBI's most wanted list. He is linked by DNA to 11 crimes and is suspected of 35 in total across the Los Angeles area, the Innocence Project said.\n\nOn the day of his sentencing in 1999, Vargas told the court, \"I'm concerned (the) individual (who) really did these crimes might really be raping someone out there, might really be killing someone out there.\"\n\nIn assaults going back to 1996 on victims ranging between 14 and 41 years old, the suspect in most of the cases tried to engage in conversation with a woman walking to work or school, then pulled a weapon, forced her into a secluded area and sexually assaulted her, officials have said. He was often armed with a gun or a knife.\n\nEvery one of the attacks happened in the morning between 5 and 8.\n\nPolice in 2012 released several sketches of the suspect they described as a light-skinned Hispanic man between 40 and 55 years old.\n\nHis most striking characteristic is the tattoo some victims have reported seeing on his face, though even that was shrouded in uncertainty, with some remembering it on one side of his face and some on the other, and some reporting one teardrop, others two.\n\nOfficials said there was even some evidence the man may have had the tattoo removed.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Richard, good to see you as always.  Thank you for joining me.\n\nYou can watch Richard`s full report on assignment \"On Assignment, Made in China\" Sunday 10:00 p.m. Eastern right here on MSNBC.  \"THE 11TH HOUR\" with Brian Williams starts now.\n\nBRIAN WILLIAMS, THE 11TH HOUR, HOST:  Tonight the haunting images of an American vice president staring at caged men being held by the United States.  Reporters who were there tonight describing the sight of it, the smell, the migrant stories of being denied basic hygiene while sleeping on concrete.\n\nAlso the President loses another Cabinet secretary, Alex Acosta is out.  The latest fallout from the case of sexual predator and long-time friend of Trump, Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nAnd is another cabinet member headed out this gets more serious with reports that Trump is mulling over the firing of our director of National Intelligence.\n\nAnd the late word tonight Mueller`s testimony has been delayed a week but the Democrats claim it`s for a good reason.  All of it as THE 11TH HOUR gets underway on a Friday night.\n\nWell, good evening once again from our NBC News headquarters here in New York.  Day 904 of the Trump administration.  It`s been an eventful, one, Labor Secretary Alex Acosta resigned today after the latest fallout after his secret plea deal for sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.  Tonight, federal prosecutors are accusing Epstein of witness tampering.\n\nWe`ve also just learned the congressional hearing for Robert Mueller, his testimony has been delayed.  Testimony was supposed to happen this coming Wednesday.  It`s now been postponed until July 24th.\n\nSo much more ahead on all of those topics but we begin tonight with this breaking news out of McAllen, Texas.  And the images just into us tonight are rather incredible.  They show Mike Pence, the Vice President, the man in black flanked by Lindsey Graham among others looking at men who are just feet away from them inside a chain linked cage and in plain English, it`s what -- if it looks like this when the feds know they are coming, what must it be like in other facilities.\n\nAnd about these conditions, \"Washington Post\" reporter Josh Dawsey accompanied the vice presidential delegation.  He supplied some of his own imagery.  And most importantly, he supplied this description as the designated pool reporter on the scene filing news back for reporters in Washington and we quote.  \"Almost 400 men were in caged fences with no cots.  The stench was horrendous.  The cages were so crowded that it would have been impossible for all of the men to lie on the concrete.\n\nThere were 384 single men in the portal who allegedly crossed the border illegally.  There were no mats or pillows, some of the men were sleeping on concrete.  When the men saw the press arrive, they began shouting and wanted to tell us they had been in there 40 days or longer.  The men said they were hungry and wanted to brush their teeth.  It was sweltering hot.\n\nAgents were guarding the ages wearing face masks.  Water was available outside the fences.  And agents said the men could leave and get water when the press wasn`t there.  Most of the men did not speak English and looked dirty.  They said they had been there for 40 days or more upon questioning from the pool.\n\nWe were pulled out of the portal within 90 seconds and a White House official said the secret service expressed opposition to the Vice President going in.  He briefly went into the room, \"I was not surprised by what I saw\" Pence said later at a news conference.  I knew we`d see a system that was overwhelmed.\"\n\nJust this morning at the White House, the President was eager to preview the Vice President`s trip.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  So they are touring detention centers and that was my idea because I read a phony story in the \"New York Times\" today or the other day about the detention centers, about the conditions and I had people calling me up at the highest level from border patrol and ICE.  Almost crying about that phony story and they never saw anything.  They have phony sources. They don`t even have sources, they write whatever they want.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWILLIAMS:  Trump also confirmed that immigration and customs enforcement agents will carry out nationwide raids to round up undocumented migrants this weekend.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP:  It starts on Sunday and they`re going to take people out and they`re going to bring them back to their countries or they are going to take criminals out, put them in prison or put them in prison in the countries they came from.  We`re focused on criminals as much as we can.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWILLIAMS:  So there you have it.  And with us for an important lead off discussion on this summer Friday night, Jeremy Bash, former Chief of Staff at CIA and the Pentagon, former Chief Counsel for the House Intel Committee.  Emily Cochrane, Congressional Reporter for \"The New York Times\" who is notably been covering the Trump administration`s border crisis all this while.  And General Barry McCaffrey, Retired U.S. Army Four-Star General heavily decorated combat veteran of Vietnam, a U.S. ground commander in the Gulf War among other distinguished titles in his lifetime.  Welcome to you all.\n\nJeremy Bash with all apologies to Malcolm Gladwell we have had what looked like and seemed like tipping points in this administration before.  Is this one in fact do you think?\n\nJEREMY BASH, FMR. CIA CHIEF OF STAFF:  Those images are hard to watch, Brian.  I mean, we are a nation where we typically welcome refugees, welcome asylum seekers, welcome the huddles masses yearning to be free.  And here we`re keeping them in absolutely inhumane conditions.\n\nAnd here is the point. They are purposely being held in inhumane conditions.  The Vice President of the United States is purposely bringing his press pool in there to show, to broadcast, to display for all to see that we separate families, that we keep people in inhumane conditions and we are preannouncing a law enforcement action not for any operational purposes but to scare people to go into hiding because this is all political.  This is all about sending a message.\n\nWILLIAMS:  And Emily indeed, the question again, what is it like when they don`t know you`re coming or was this intended as a scare tactic?\n\nEMILY COCHRANE, THE NEW YORK TIMES CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER:  Well, according to Josh Dawsey`s pool report, the Vice President`s office was clear that they wanted the visit to be as accurate as possible.  They didn`t want border patrol to sanitize the conditions in any way to show the accuracy.  Certainly, these images will resonate on Capitol Hill where there are already been divisive debates over how to fund customs and border patrol, how to fund border agents and ICE.\n\nWILLIAMS:  General, I`m going to play for you an exchange after the visit.  This is between the journalist Josh Dawsey of \"The Washington Post\" who filed those gripping dispatches from inside the room and the Vice President.  We`ll talk about it on the other side.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJOSH DAWSEY, WASHINGTON POST WHITE HOUSE REPORTER:  Mr. Vice President, we just saw 384 men outside, we saw them briefly too sleeping on concretes, no pillows, no -- nowhere to basically stay or stand.  Some of them said they were thirsty.  Some of them said they hadn`t showered in 10, 20, 30 days.  Some of them were pretty despondent.  Does that meet this administration`s standard for how we take care of people?\n\nMIKE PENCE, (R) VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  In what you saw today was that the facility here in McAllen is overwhelmed.  I wouldn`t take the word of people that are being detained here in McAllen for how they are being treated.  But I`m very confident that they are being provided with shelter and water and food and access to health care and access to hygiene.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWILLIAMS:  So general, there you have it and it`s a tough question to you, what does this say about us around the world or is the answer to that, it says exactly what administration wants to say about us around the world?\n\nGEN. BARRY MCCAFFREY, U.S. ARMY (RET.):  You know, Brain, I`ve spent a lot of time in that U.S., Mexican border and Mexico and Central America and I never seen a more shameful situation ever.\n\nPart of it -- by the way, I don`t think is a dauber (ph) policy.  I think it`s incompetence on such a scale that we`re unwilling to look at that as the rational for what we`re seeing.  The numbers don`t work.  There is 58,000 people in customs and border patrol.  There is around 81,000 detainees either in ICE., CBP or Health and Human Services.\n\nIn May, a 144,000 people crossed the border.  This law enforcement agency, the Border Patrol of 18,000 agents is not going to be able to handle it.  So we got a policy that producing a humanitarian disaster.  They got to fix it.  They got to call their National Guard in the four Border States and take care of these poor people.\n\nWILLIAMS:  General, you`ve also said this is systemic.  Look to the south.  Look at the trail of people.  Look at the problems in the nations where all of the men in that pin have come from.\n\nMCCAFFREY:  Oh, yeah, no, the triangle in Central America is a disaster of violence injustice, corruption and competence.  Anybody in their right mind is going to try to get out of there and get to the United States.  So clearly, you need a system approach in which you`re trying to create conditions in Central America that make it more likely that they can survive in their homeland.  And then finally, we got to sort out what should rational policy be dealing with asylum seekers and economic migrants.\n\nYou know, there is 11 million of us here in this country who are here illegally, and they are part of the economy and they are by in large law- abiding.  So, what is it we`re trying to achieve?  And it didn`t start with Mr. Trump, either, I might add, you know, the Obama team deported 3 million people, so we have no rational policy dealing with this southern border.\n\nWILLIAMS:  Indeed, Emily the Vice President mentioned Congress tonight in numerous remarks, numerous interviews.  What efforts are underway at a remedy?\n\nCOCHRANE:  So Congress just passed $4.6 billion in emergency aid for the southwestern border.  Speaker Pelosi has said that she plans to bring a couple pieces of legislation dealing with stricter oversight for Homeland Security and humanitarian aid for migrants to the floor.  Whether or not that makes it to the Senate remains to be scene.  And ultimately Congress does have to fund these agencies and departments through the next fiscal year.  The spending limit is September 30th and Congress will have to decide how they fund these agencies going forward.\n\nWILLIAMS:  Emily, when you come back from that region, back to your life, presumably in Washington, what do you tell the people you know, the people around you about what strikes you down there?\n\nCOCHRANE:  I think what struck me the most from the few migrants that I was able to speak to was how much they wanted to still come to the United States, to be in this country, and that`s what brought them here in the first place.\n\nWILLIAMS:  Jeremy Bash, how do you clean up a mess this large?\n\nBASH:  Well, just to pull on the thread that General McCaffrey laid out for us, which is this incompetence or is this deliberate?  I certainly agree if there`s a lot of incompetence to go around.  But what concerns me is that when the President preannounces an ICE. raid, now remember, we`ve done immigration law enforcement raids before, they are normally kept secrete, number one, so that they`ll be effective.  And number two, to protect the law enforcement officers that may have to go into, say, in an MS-13 safe house.\n\nNow, by preannouncing the President has not only endangered ICE officials but he has also tried to instill fear and scare people, scare families, scare people to think that they`re going to be separated from their children or from their parents or from their loved ones.  So this really has the hallmarks of the old soviet knock at the doors, the Stalinist tactics, the Gestapo tactics of trying to round people up in the middle of the night.  This is not law enforcement.  This is not operational.  This is pure politics designed to instill fear and designed to make the President seem like he`s doing something on immigration when he`s really not doing anything.\n\nWILLIAMS:  General McCaffrey, your reaction to not only the raids this weekend but as Jeremy was talking about, this advanced billing.\n\nMCCAFFREY:  Well, the advanced billing has just measured Trump, that`s what he does.  It all comes back to him staying in the spotlight.  Clearly, it`s a political act.\n\nBut look, Brian, you back off the whole issue.  There`s 11.4 million undocumented migrants in the U.S.  They are vital to our economy.  If by some magic non-sense we could round them all up and send them back where they came from, the economy would be a disaster.  They grow our food, they take care of our kids they do most of the construction work in the United States.\n\nSo again, you know, what is the objective of all this activity?  We do need to control our borders, no question about that.  A couple times and miles from Mexico, 5,000 miles to Canada, it ought to be a law enforcement presence.  But, you know, at the end of the day, we are simply not going to be able to stop people at the border and round up millions of people who are in the economy and send them back.  Both sides need to sit down in Congress and pass sensible laws.\n\nWILLIAMS:  Can`t thank our guests enough, as we said it`s a consequential night with a lot of our news coming in late.  To Jeremy Bash, to Emily Cochrane, to General Barry McCaffrey, our thanks.\n\nAnd coming up for us, as we said at the top of the broadcast, there has been a delay, we won`t hear from Robert Mueller this coming week but he`ll apparently spend more time testifying by sliding the date a week later.\n\nAlso tonight, the disturbing story of a sex offender formally in the Trump social circle, today the scandal cost a Cabinet member his job.  We`ll hear from the reporter who has helped break this story wide open publicly as THE 11TH HOUR is just getting started on this busy Friday night.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nWILLIAMS:  Robert Mueller`s testimony on the Hill now delayed by a week.  He`ll testify in public on Wednesday, July 24th instead of the 17th.  He`ll first appear before the House Judiciary Committee for three hours starting at 8:30 a.m. and then give testimony to the Intelligence Committee.\n\nMeanwhile, President Trump`s Labor Secretary, Alex Acosta, announced his resignation today amid the on going controversy over the plea deal he brokered with sex-offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nEarlier today President Trump appeared with Acosta on the White House lawn as something of a parting gift as they spoke to reporters.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP:  He`s done a fantastic job.  He`s a friend of everybody in the administration.  And I got a call this morning early from Alex and I think he did a very good job yesterday under a lot of pressure.\n\nI just want to let you know, this was him not me because I`m with them.  He was a -- he`s a tremendous talent.  He`s a Hispanic man.  He went to Harvard, a great student.\n\nALEX ACOSTA, LABOR SECRETARY:  I have seen coverage of this case that is over 12 years old that had input and vetting at multiple levels at the department of justice.  And as I look forward, I did not think it was right and fair for this administration`s Labor Department to have Epstein as the focus rather than the incredible economy that we have today.  And so I called the President this morning, I told him I thought the right thing was to step aside.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWILLIAMS:  So there you have it and with us to talk about it tonight, two pros, Jonathan Allen, our NBC News National Political Reporter and Josh Gerstein, , Senior Legal Affairs Contributor for Politico.\n\nDr. Allen, I`d like to begin with you let`s talk about this Hispanic man that went to Harvard. And I have a dual question for you, a, what business did he have standing in the briefing room of the Labor Department, standing behind the seal of a Cabinet agency using the imprimatur of the federal government to relitigate his handling of the case of a sexual predator?  B, what standing did he have, what business did he have serving as Labor Secretary to begin with?\n\nJONATHAN ALLEN, NBC NEWS NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER:  Well, number one, Brian, let me just say that Dr. Allen is my mother.\n\nNumber two, look, what we saw yesterday with Alex Acosta in this sort of ritual as we`ve become used to it of an audience of, one, humiliation press conference where people beg for their jobs from President Trump.  It was unusual in that, it was delivered standing behind that U.S. government seal.  This man trying to position himself to keep one job after all these questions have been raised about what he did in another job as a federal prosecutor representing the people of the United States of America and cutting what anybody would call a shady deal with a man whose now been accused of all of these sex trafficking related crimes dealing with underaged girls.  This is somebody whose reputation was obviously on the line.\n\nIt was completely unsustainable for him to remain in office, not just from the perspective of representing the American public at the Labor Department but more important to President Trump from the perspective of his campaign for reelection and his continuing administration.  Alex Acosta everywhere he went would have been asked about this from the questions you just asked.  And President Trump would have been asked about it everywhere he went.\n\nWILLIAMS:  Josh, there`s no polite way to say this.  A lot of people have a lot to worry about in this Epstein case.\n\nJOSH GERSTEIN, POLITICO SR. LEGAL AFFAIRS CONTRIBUTOR:  Oh yes, the circles that he traveled in included academia, science, philanthropy, the business world, he was one of these figures who liked to convene what he would probably salon type dinners, a boat in New York and in Palm Beach.  And it`s in that capacity that he ran across at different times, both President Trump and former President Bill Clinton as well as a lot of other figures, Allan Dershowitz among others.  And all those people are having their connection to Epstein scrutinize in greater detail now than ever in the past.\n\nAlthough, I should say, Brian, that the outlines of this Epstein story and the connection to Acosta have been well established in the public record for at least five years.  There was a book written about it by anti- trafficking activist, Conchita Sarnoff, really five years ago or so.\n\nThe minute Acosta was nominated, I was surprised to hear his name even put forth as a potential nominee for Labor Secretary because I said I couldn`t believe that this administration would be interested in having this discussion.  We had a story up on 90 minutes after he was nominated.  So, so this information was out there and really no one in Washington has bathed themselves in glory or acquitted themselves particularly well in terms of the vetting process for a Cabinet nominee.  We`re not talking about an obscure position in the federal government here.\n\nWILLIAMS:  Hey, John, considering the quote I saw from a member of Congress, which may be a very apt warning letting people know that the Mueller testimony may be a kin to a book on tape, what does the delay in the Mueller testimony mean to you, what should our audience know about it?\n\nALLEN:  It may be a very dull book on tape if it`s rendered in that way and certainly the way he gave his previous press conference.  Look, I think the delay means a couple things.  Number one, more members will get a crack at them.  Number two, it will be closer to the August recess and there are two pieces to that.  It means that the members of Congress aren`t going to be in Washington to talk to reporters about it for very long.  And the House is not going to be convening to take any action.\n\nI mean, it was subsequent to it.  But it also means that those members are going to go back to town halls and to talk to their constituents and they`re going to get an immediate read on what the reaction of their constituents is.  And so if there is a big push for an impeachment right afterward, they`re going to hear about it quickly.\n\nAnd then of course the third thing is, the President wanted to put a book end on this testimony with a rally he had one planned for later and still has one planned for later that night on July 17th and now does not have currently a rally planned for July 24th.  So, we may see one pop up on the calendar pretty quickly but they seem at the moment to have evaded giving him that opportunity.\n\nWILLIAMS:  Josh, John makes a great point.  The last thing Congress is going to do is ruin their own summer vacation but it may be a case of be careful what you wish for if they go from hours of Mueller on live television on networks like this one right into town hall meetings with constituents wanting to know what they are doing about it.\n\nGERSTEIN:  Yes, I mean, there is going to be considerable pressure at least on some members of Congress.  And you have to remember of course, the people that come to the town hall meetings are going to be the folks that are more engaged, that are more interested and probably more likely to pressure their members to move forward.  So I do think almost everything that`s done on this front leads to more of a drum beat for impeachment.\n\nI still think we`re going to have to look at the opinion polls after this hearing and see, though, whether it really moved the needle in a significant way in terms of sort of the vast middle of America that is not caught up in the Mueller drama and the Trump drama on the day to day basis.\n\nWILLIAMS:  Gentlemen, you`re both free to go to enjoy what`s left of your week.  John Allen, Josh Gerstein, we appreciate you coming on, on a Friday night.\n\nGERSTEIN:  Thank you, Brian.\n\nWILLIAMS:  Coming up for us, the latest on the Jeffrey Epstein case as even more of his accusers now come forward just as the feds asked them too.  The tenacious journalist who`s reporting help to initiate all of this will be with us here next when we continue.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMICHELLE LICATA, ALLEGED EPSTEIN VICTIM:  They found my name and number at his house that I had written down and they found me.  And so we had to have my mom`s permission.  So I had to tell her the story all over again. And I remember teller her, \"I don`t want you to think of me as not your little girl anymore.\"  I was like, \"Don`t think anything other than what you already know of me.\"\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWILLIAMS:  That was Jeffrey Epstein`s first accuser to speak publicly to the Miami Herald.   She was interviewed by our next guest.  His alleged victims are sharing harrowing stories of abuse even as reports surface of at least a dozen more potential victims.\n\nRemember, the feds asked for victims to come forward at the press conference.  Epstein was arrested in New York a week ago tomorrow night, he`s trying to convince a judge to let him out on bail and let him await trial at his Manhattan mansion.\n\nNew court documents from a hearing on that request reveal new accusations, this time of witness tampering.  Prosecutors say, \"Within recent months, Epstein paid significant amounts of money to influence individuals who were close to him and who might be witnesses against him at a trial.\"\n\nThe reported payments $350,000 in all came within days of the Miami Herald series of reports detailing dozens of cases alleging Epstein sexually abused young girls in the early 2000s.\n\nThe series of reports also laid bare the secret plea deal brokered by then US attorney now former cabinet secretary Alex Acosta that gave Epstein just 13 months in jail and immunity from federal charges.\n\nThe President again today attempted to distance himself from his friend of many years.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES:  I wasn`t a big fan of Jeffrey Epstein that I can tell you.  And now if you look the remnants hurt this man and I hate to see it happen.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWILLIAMS:  Epstein has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.  We are so happy to have with us tonight Julie K. Brown, Investigative Reporter for the Miami Herald who has reported so extensively on the scandal.\n\nJulie, let`s begin with the last element, and that`s the President.  When you hear him try to distance himself from Epstein, what do you want to tell the folks watching this broadcast and reading your work?\n\nJULIE K. BROWN, INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER, MIAMI HERALD:  Well, I mean, he should have, I hope, that his people did the research ahead of time before they nominated him to find out about this case.  It had certainly been reported before that Epstein got some kind of an unusual lenient plea deal.  So it`s kind of baffling to me that the President seems like he doesn`t -- he didn`t get that memo so to speak that he was hiring someone who let essentially an accused pedophile, you know, escape some serious prison time.\n\nWILLIAMS:  And, Julie, what about the President`s history with Epstein?  Does it hold water when he says he was never a fan?\n\nBROWN:  Well, you know, the President has people that are -- you know, we know how he hires people and he`s fans of them, and then the next day or a month later he`s not a fan of theirs.  So it`s hard to say.  Maybe he wasn`t a fan at one point and he was at another point, I don`t think we really know the full story about his relationship with Mr. Epstein.\n\nWILLIAMS:  And when Epstein asks to be confined to his New York mansion, East 71st Street, in a beautiful part of the city of New York while awaiting trial, is that evidence to you that he retains some of hootspa (ph) he has displayed in his private life for so many decades?\n\nBROWN:  Yes.  And, you know, he is a master at manipulating the system using his power and money, and this proposal that he would give up his passport, ground his plane, hire some private security people to monitor him is somewhat laughable because that`s exactly the kind of thing that he did back in 2008, 2009 when he was, you know, in jail in Palm Beach.  And he managed to get them to approve his valet picking him up every day at the jail, and letting him go to an office he had set up in West Palm Beach.\n\nSo he is a master at trying to get people to do what he wants essentially.\n\nWILLIAMS:  You have talked to what is it almost 60 women alleged victims in this case.  For them, in their lives, as scared as they were talking, you were it.  You were in effect, their government, you were their confidant, you were their advocate.  You must have been happy at some level even though you`re a journalist and not a participant.\n\nSeeing the feds, that press conference in New York, seeing them for the first time in all of this speaking up on behalf of the victims.\n\nBROWN:  Well, I really give all the credit to them.  They, you know, some time has passed.  At the time that Mr. Acosta was nominated, my first thought after the confirmation hearings or, you know, one of the question to him about this case, I thought what did these girls, who are now women, think about this.  And that`s what kind of drove me to try to see if I could track them down.\n\nAnd, you know, they felt betrayed and it took a lot of courage, I think, for them to share their stories with me.  And I can`t thank them enough and I`m sure other victims who are now feeling a little bit more comfortable coming forward are doing so because of them.\n\nWILLIAMS:  A recipient of the Polk Award, Julie K. Brown with Miami Herald, thank you so much for spending sometime on our broadcast.  We appreciate it.\n\nAnd coming up for us on this Friday night, the President is playing with House money on this.  It gets critical now as he is considering another personnel change one that could directly impact the security of our country, more on that after this.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nWILLIAMS:  So Alex Acosta out of the Trump cabinet.  He was number 13 to leave, there maybe another one on the way and this one is potentially big.\n\nAxios was first to report today that \"President Trump has told confidants he`s eager to remove Dan Coats as director of national intelligence, according to five sources who have discussed the matter directly with the President\"\n\nSource familiar with the matter tells NBC News indeed that in February, Trump spoke with John Bolton`s former Chief of Staff Fred Fleitz about replacing Coats.  Fleitz is a former CIA officer now heads a think tank.  The Anti-Defamation League says \"has promulgated a number of anti-Muslim conspiracy theories over the years.  Chief among them is the allegation that the US government has been infiltrated by the Muslim Brotherhood and that a number of political figures have actual ties to the group.\"\n\nWe have asked two gentlemen to come back on with us, Jeremy Bash and General Barry McCaffrey from earlier in the broadcast.\n\nGeneral, before the break, I used the phrase that the President is playing with house money.  Secretary of labor is one thing.  This job speaks to our national protection.  It speaks to our election protection in ways we could not have imagined even five years ago.  It speaks to public safety.  Talk about Dan Coats and the job of DNI.\n\nGEN. BARRY MCCAFFREY, RETIRED US ARMY:  Well, you know, our intelligence collection services are simply unbelievably good.  Electronic intercept, phone in, you meant.  It`s coordinated.  There are 17 different intelligence agencies.  The DNI is supposed to bring them together, to rationalize, to integrate.\n\nDan Coats is a public servant of tremendous dignity and good judgment, army vet, congressman, senator, ambassador to Germany, and he`s objective.\n\nSo I think -- and Jeremy, I know knows a lot about this, the biggest problem you can have is when you`re intelligence system tells you things they want you -- they think you want to know.\n\nSo I don`t know Mr. Fleitz.  General Dunford`s name is also floating around out there probably pretty good.  But I think Mr. Trump doesn`t like independent objective advice.\n\nWILLIAMS:  Jeremy Bash, Dan Coats and your old boss, Leon Panetta, are falls apart kind of personality-wise.  I do believe Dan Coats was kind of unfairly dismissed as a kind of Chamber of Commerce, Republican from Indiana, look at what his challenge has been under this boss and the ramparts he is built up around this job.\n\nSo, Jeremy, same question, do you address what his loss would mean?\n\nJEREMY BASH, FORMER CIA CHIEF OF STAFF:  I couldn`t agree more with General McCaffrey.  Dan Coats is a highly capable, highly honorable public servant.  And, of course, though he comes from the political side of the House having served as a Republican senator and Republican ambassador, he`s done the job in a non-political way, in a non-partisan way.\n\nAnd really what he`s done is he`s kept the intelligence community off the so-called X.  He`s really kept them out of the line of fire for the most part from the President although the President has, of course, been launching broadsides about the \"deep state\".\n\nAnd, of course, he`s been rejecting some of the fundamental conclusions of the intelligence community by in large the community has got its nose down is doing its job and is serving its purpose.  And Dan Coats has been able leading them.\n\nI think a loss of Dan Coats would be a problem unless they replace him with a non-political career person like his current deputy Sue Gordon.  But if they bring in someone who is highly political, highly partisan, I think it`s a huge problem.\n\nWILLIAMS:  General, this is a DNI who, let`s not forget.  Listen to the President take Putin`s word over his and let`s not forget a DNI who learned in public from Andrea Mitchell who, we both know that the President had invited Putin to the White House.  All of it he kind of kept in with dignity and kept going forward.\n\nMCCAFFREY:  Yes, that`s almost a world turned upside down.  We are going to be in terrible danger if we can`t keep the intelligence services of the United States focused on objectively understanding the threat to our security.\n\nA public servant like Dan Coats has done just that.  If they put a political angry and Islamophobe in there who selectively feeds information to the White House, the National Security apparatus, then I think we`re going be in great trouble.\n\nBut, you know, at the end of the day, Brian, this is all about the President.  This is not about Bolton or Mr. Fleitz or whoever.  We`ve had an erratic, impulsive, and unwise series of choices on national security.\n\nI love Kim Jong-un.  There is no hurry about him producing -- continuing produces all material.  This aggressive stance with Iran, you put him in a box and don`t let him have a pass out.  So, I think we got a very troubling pattern of national security decision-making.\n\nWILLIAMS:  Gentlemen, I can`t thank you both enough.  I`m going to ask if you both come on in the days ahead if I can put in graphic form, the vacancies in Department of Defense and we can talk about all of them and the way they leave us open in various ways.   Jeremy Bash, General Barry McCaffrey, our thanks on a Friday night.\n\nAnd coming up, to our south, our attention goes, the storm that is not yet a hurricane, that is bringing more water to some places than Katrina did.  A long weekend is ahead for our friends in New Orleans and the rest of the great state of Louisiana.  We`ll get a late report in just a moment.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMATT LUPOLI, REPORTER, WDSU:  We`re standing on the levee at the end of Canal Boulevard and we`ve been watching as Lake Pontchartrain just continues to lap at the shoreline here.\n\nIn fact, you can see waves with white caps coming up over the edge.  The lake side is looking a little -- more like an ocean shoreline right now.  And much of the park between us and the lake is already under water.\n\nPeople who live right on the edge of this park tell us, they`re used to seeing the water collect here but obviously, the concern is that it just keeps collecting.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWILLIAMS:  That`s our station down in New Orleans, WDSU.  This is an uneasy night for people living along the Gulf Coast as this Tropical Storm Barry heads toward coastal Louisiana.\n\nThere is a possibility that by the time the last drop of rain from this storm falls, some areas will receive something between 25 and 28 inches of rain, can you imagine?  Some of the rain falling at the rate of three to four inches an hour with a storm surge hitting the mouth of the Mississippi River.  The river is already at dangerous levels.\n\nThe city of New Orleans has issued a shelter in place order that went into effect at 8:00 pm local time.  This is kind of a new euphemism we all have to get used to.  It`s government speak for saying, stay home.\n\nParts of the city were already hit with flooding earlier this week days ahead of the storm`s arrival.\n\nWith more on what to expect in the hours ahead, we`re so happy to be joined by Chief Meteorologist for our NBC New York station, WNBC, Janice Huff.\n\nAnd, Janice, you and I were talking earlier, I`ve heard meteorologists today say they would be happier if this thing was a hurricane, that would at least give it more energy and it would move faster out of the region.\n\nJANICE HUFF, WNBC CHIEF METEOROLOGIST:  Yet, Brian, and that is the large issue with the storm is the speed of it, it`s not moving.  It`s barely moving at walking speed.  We`re talking west at 3 miles an hour, and you can walk faster than that in most cases.\n\nThe top winds now near the core at 65 miles an hour.  They`re starting to feel that along the coastal areas of Louisiana.  The center is 75 miles south of Morgan City, Louisiana, so that`s an area that`s still in the brunt of the wind right now.\n\nWe can start to see those rain bands forming, which we haven`t seen in a while because there had been so much dry air on the north side of the system, sort of shutting it down.  Most of the energy and most of the rain was just south of that out in the gulf.  But now we`re starting to see some of those rain bands forming here.\n\nNow, the good news, if there`s good news at all about this storm, which is not good news for most people in central Louisiana into Mississippi.  But for New Orleans, there is some good news in terms of rainfall.  The bulk of that heaviest rain talking upwards of 25 inches will be west of New Orleans.\n\nThe problem is, the not so good news is places like in between New Orleans all the way to Baton Rouge and to southwestern Mississippi the places like notches, these areas are going to be dealing with the worst rain and also the worst river flooding here and likely flash flooding.\n\nThe New Orleans could get some flash flooding.  That is possible for streets and highways.  But in terms of the inundation flooding now and breaching the levees and the hydrologist that forecast for the rivers, plea that may not happen now but it`s going to come very, very close.  So they`ll be watching that very carefully.\n\nIn the meantime, we`re looking at storm surge here.  And that`s what I was just saying.  So now they`re predicting storm surge to be about three to five feet around New Orleans.  If it stays below five feet, I`ve been hearing that that would be just fine, they won`t have to worry about the water coming over the levees, they worry about it going over five feet so we`ll have to keep watching that.\n\nOf course, the greatest storm surge will be here on the shore areas towards Grand Isle.  And then to the north, Baton Rouge dealing with a very heavy rain, and this could be catastrophic in some cases.  You`re talking about two feet of rain in a -- over a duration of time.  This is going to take hours and hours and days.  It`ll be still in Central Louisiana, North Central Louisiana on Sunday.\n\nSo it`s going to take a very long time for this to even move out of the state of Louisiana.  And then when it does, it moves up the Mississippi River Valley, and then there could be heavy rain and flooding in parts of Mississippi.  And then, eventually into parts of maybe even Western Tennessee, parts of Southern Missouri, into the Ohio Valley, it`s going to take days before this even moves out of this area.  And it might even affect the weather here in the northeast by Thursday of next week, Brian.\n\nWILLIAMS:  All right.  Janice Huff, thank you.  We`re thinking about everybody down there, one of the great parts of the world.  Appreciate you coming up tonight.\n\nAnd coming up for us, there`s a way to talk about Donald Trump and there`s a way to talk to him, and there`s a penalty if you don`t.  We saw it in an action today, that when we come back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK):\n\nWILLIAMS:  Last thing before we go tonight, is just once again a reminder of how the attorney general of the United States feels he has to talk when he`s around the President.  This was just yesterday following a loss for Trump, the abandonment of the legal effort to make a question about citizenship a part of the census.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWILLIAM BARR, US ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Thank you, Mr. President.  And congratulations on today`s executive order, which will ensure that we finally have an accurate understanding of how many citizens and non- citizens live in our country.\n\nI applaud the President for recognizing in his executive order that including a question on the census is not the only way to obtain this vital information.\n\nCongratulations, again, Mr. President, on taking this effective action\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWILLIAMS:  Indeed.  While he was speaker of the House, Paul Ryan of Wisconsin made for an ideal Trump supplicant.  And while he was unwilling to be candid when the American people were paying his salary, now, he`s quoted in a new book about to come out called \"American Carnage\" where he is America has grown numb to the President and, \"I`m telling you, he didn`t know anything about government.  I wanted to scold him all the time.  Those of us around him really helped to stop him from making bad decisions.  All the time, he goes on, don`t call a woman a horse face.  Don`t cheat on your wife.  Don`t cheat on anything.  Be a good person.  Set a good example.\"\n\nWell, today, Trump was asked about the former speaker of the House, Paul Ryan.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES:  So Paul Ryan was not a talent.  He wasn`t a leader.  Paul Ryan was a lame duck for a long time as speaker.  He was unable to raise money.  He lost control of the House.\n\nThe only success Paul Ryan had was the time that he was with me because we got taxes cut, I got regulation cuts.  I did that mostly without him.\n\nBut for Paul Ryan to be complaining is pretty amazing.  I remember a day in Wisconsin, the state that I won, where I stood up and made a speech, and then I introduced him and they booed him off the stage, 10,000 people.  So for him to be going out and opening his mouth is pretty incredible but maybe he gets paid for that, who knows?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWILLIAMS:  And our regular, normalcy reminder, we`ve never seen anything like this ever in American public life, not even remotely close.\n\nAnd with that, that is our broadcast for this Friday night and for this week.  Thank you so very much for being here with us.  Have a good weekend and goodnight from our NBC News Headquarters here in New York.\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.                                                                                                     END\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

We didn`t discuss.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES (voice-over): Tonight why Donald Trump chickened out of demanding payment for his border wall. How the Mexican people received a foreign candidate who`s been insulting them for over a year. And can Donald Trump`s last-minute surprise gamble actually pay off? Plus, the Clinton response, and Hillary`s American exceptionalism appeal to Ohio.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We`re still Reagan`s shining city on a hill.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES (voice-over): And ahead of Trump`s big immigration speech, a reality check.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: We don`t even have a border. People are just flowing through like water. There is no border right now.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES (voice-over): We`ll show you where Donald Trump is misleading voters on immigration when ALL IN starts right now.\n\nHAYES: Good evening from New York. I`m Chris Hayes. It is a very big news night and has been a very big news day. We are now just one hour from Donald Trump`s highly anticipated speech on immigration in Arizona where we hope we`ll finally get a clear answer to the question his campaign steadfastly refuses to answer, or has steadfastly refused to answer of late. Does Trump still back a so-called deportation force who would scour the country to forcibly expel the roughly 11 million people living in the U.S. without documentation? Which was Trump`s position in the Republican primary. Or is he now reversing his stance in favor of policy more palatable to general election voters? Much more on that shortly. But first we take you to Mexico, a country Trump has repeatedly vilified and whose people largely distain Trump in return. And where Mexico`s president Enrique Pena Nieto is now directly contradicting what Donald Trump said happened during their meeting in Mexico City today. Pena Nieto is saying he made it clear Mexico will not pay for Trump`s so-called wall, a contradiction the Clinton campaign is seizing on tonight and calling Trump a liar. Trump`s visit to Mexico marked his first foreign campaign trip as a presidential candidate. He met with Mexico`s president behind closed doors. The two men appeared together after their meeting with Pena Nieto speaking first in Spanish as Trump listened to a translator. Despite having in the past likened Trump`s rhetoric to that of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, Pena Nieto adopted a largely collegial tone, describing his conversation with Trump as, quote, open and constructive. But he also offered Trump something of a public reality check referencing the fall in unauthorized migration from Mexico to the U.S. and the illegal flow of guns from the U.S. into Mexico, and pointedly stating Mexicans are good people and deserve respect. Trump spoke next, and while he called Mexicans drug dealers, criminals and rapists on the campaign trail, he adopted a very, very different tone today.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: I happen to have a tremendous feeling for Mexican-Americans, not only in terms of friendships but in terms of the tremendous numbers that I employ in the United States. And they are amazing people, amazing people. I have many friends, so many friends, and so many friends coming to Mexico and in Mexico. I am proud to say how many people I employ. And the United States first, second and third generation Mexicans are just beyond reproach, spectacular, spectacular hardworking people. I have such great respect for them and their strong values of family, faith and community.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES: Trump also indirectly addressed the elephant in the room, his planned wall along the U.S./Mexico border.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: We recognize and respect the right of either country to build a physical barrier or wall on any of its borders to stop the illegal movement of people, drugs, and weapons.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES: On the campaign trail, Trump has famously insisted that Mexico will pay for that wall, a claim that appears to delight many of his supporters, including this guy spotted at a Trump rally in March.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: Mexico does not like us. Mexico is not our friend. Mexico is the new China. Mexico will pay -- you mark my words -- I win. Mexico pays.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN: How are you going to make them pay for the wall?\n\nTRUMP: I will, and the wall just got 10 feet taller. Believe me.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: Who`s going to pay for the wall? Who`s going to pay? I didn`t hear you. Who`s going to pay?\n\nCROWD: Mexico!\n\nTRUMP: Better believe it.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES: Now today was Trump`s big opportunity to back up all that tough talk over months. And according to former Tea Party Congressman Joe Walsh, \"If real Donald Trump comes back from Mexico tomorrow with a big check from Mexico to pay for that wall, that`s game set match.\" If you`re watching, Joe Walsh, I`ve got some bad news.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: We didn`t discuss who pays for the wall, we didn`t discuss. We did discuss the wall, we didn`t discuss payment of the wall. That`ll be for a later date. This was a very preliminary meeting.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES: Crucially, that is not what the other person in the meeting says, Pena Nieto, in a tweet a short time ago, quote, at the start of my conversation with Donald Trump, I made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall. Either way, Trump didn`t extract that big check, fact seized on by the Clinton campaign. Donald Trump has made outlandish policy forcing Mexico to pay for his giant wall, the centerpiece of his campaign, said Hillary for America Chair John Podesta. But at the first opportunity to make good on his offensive campaign promises, Trump choked. After Pena Nieto challenged Trump`s account, Podesta added, quote, it turns out Trump didn`t just choke, he got beat in the room and lied about it. Speaking in Cincinnati before Trump`s appearance in Mexico, Clinton contrasted her work as Secretary of State with Trump`s hastily arranged trip.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCLINTON: People have to know that they can count on you, that you won`t say one thing one day and something totally different the next. And it certainly takes more than trying to make up for a year of insults and insinuations by dropping in on our neighbors for a few hours and then flying home again. That is not how it works.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES: NBC`s Hallie Jackson`s covering the Trump campaign joins me live from Phoenix where he will be speaking tonight. Well, Hallie, I think the general consensus after it was, OK, well, that didn`t go terribly, sort of all worked out.\n\nHALLIE JACKSON, CORRESPONDENT, NBC: Right.\n\nHAYES: Now you have the foreign head of state essentially calling trump a liar. Has the Trump campaign responded?\n\nJACKSON: So the Trump campaign came out with a statement regarding this issue of the payment of the wall and Pena Nieto saying that he wouldn`t pay Trump, obviously as you talked about making that a central tenet of his whole wall building process in the first place. To the campaign, it`s a disagreement between these two. And when Trump went down there, according to a communications advisor, David Miller, who released the statement, it is unsurprising that this disagreement happened because this was not a negotiation. They`re saying that a negotiation would have been inappropriate. This is a conversation that will continue, according to the campaign. Here`s the real question, Chris. So first of all, did they talk about it or not, and you`re hearing two different things from the two people who were in the room at the time, right? The other question is, how does Trump reconcile that tonight, right? In his first public remarks at this rally, and you can see the room is filling up. And let`s be clear. It is a rally. This is not, like, a formal policy speech that we`ve seen from Trump in the past. This is what I would see on any other night at 7:00 pm talking to you in one of these --\n\nHAYES: Right.\n\nJACKSON: -- (INAUDIBLE). The question is does he talk about having Mexico pay for the wall after today, the Mexican president reiterating that he`s not going to be paying for the wall? That`s the central question mark that I think we have to figure out. How does he reconcile that? How does he reconcile that very diplomatic tone that he struck with the very fiery tone that we often see on the campaign trail. Here tonight, by the way, just to pick off a couple of notable names, Governor Jan Brewer, we spotted her walking around, Sherriff Joe Arpaio also here, unsurprising as he often appears with Trump on the campaign trail. So folks getting ready for what, again, has been billed as this big speech, a really high-stakes night for Donald Trump.\n\nHAYES: All right, Hallie Jackson, thank you.\n\nJoining me now, Representative Black Farenthold of Texas, Republican who supports Donald Trump, Representative Joaquin Castro, also of Texas, who supports Hillary Clinton. Congressman Farenthold, let me begin with you. Since the wall -- the wall -- has become such a centerpiece, the Trump campaign has reiterated that it will be a physical and impenetrable barrier that will be the duration of the border of the United States. You represent folks along the border. Is that a good idea? Is that a feasible idea?\n\nREP. BLAKE FARENTHOLD (R), TEXAS: Well, listen, I think everybody agrees that we need to secure the border, and --\n\nHAYES: No, no, but the wall is specific --\n\nFARENTHOLD: -- a wall is one way to do it.\n\nHAYES: So you think there will be a -- you think it`s a good idea to build a physical and impenetrable barrier, the duration of the border between the two countries?\n\nFARENTHOLD: I`m not going to dodge your question. I`m going to say we need to secure the border. And in some places we need a wall. In some places -- and Donald Trump has said this -- there`s a geographic physical barrier where there won`t be a wall.\n\nHAYES: So you think there`s going to be -- if he`s elected, you think there`s going to be a 35 foot impenetrable wall the duration of the border. And will Mexico pay for it?\n\nFARENTHOLD: Again, I think we need to get the border secure. How it`s done, I don`t particularly care. My constituents don`t particularly care.\n\nHAYES: Well, he cares. He`s running on a wall.\n\nFARENTHOLD: The issue is securing the border.\n\nHAYES: He`s running on a wall.\n\nFARENTHOLD: And if he`s able to do that and that`s the way to secure the border, let`s do it.\n\nHAYES: Congressman Castro, what do you make of this back and forth of Pena Nieto about who -- I mean, first of all, it`s like we are talking about, you know, this sort of fictional reality as if it were real, like who will pay for this wall that isn`t going to get built.\n\nREP. JOAQUIN CASTRO (D), TEXAS: Yes.\n\nHAYES: What do you make of this exchange?\n\nCASTRO: Well, I thought that the visit was a colossal failure on the part of Donald Trump. I think also, Chris, you witnessed today one of the greatest acts of political cowardice that we`ve seen in quite some time. You think about it, Donald Trump has built a big part of his campaign, the main part of his campaign, on stoking fear and resentment. And his main argument is that he`s going to make Mexico pay for a border wall. And then he goes to Mexico, sits in front of their president, and doesn`t have the courage to even bring up the idea of Mexico paying for that wall. You know, it`s like --\n\nHAYES: Yes.\n\nCASTRO: -- somebody in school that says, when I see this guy at the end of the day, I`m going to beat him up. And then they see the person and they don`t say a word. It`s just an incredibly cowardly act for somebody who`s been talking big for a long time and also at the expense of Hispanic- Americans. You know, there was a Hispanic man, a homeless man, in Boston that was beaten up, there was a Hispanic man in San Diego who had all these ugly racial and ethnic epithets shouted at him, students that had been shouted down, called beaners and wetbacks at volleyball games and basketball games across the country in high schools. You know, so he`s really created this climate of fear and anger towards Hispanics, and then he goes there today and does this.\n\nHAYES: Congressman, do you think he choked? Do you think it was cowardly for him not to raise this principal issue, which I note is one of only seven policy positions on his website?\n\nCASTRO: Yes, I do.\n\nFARENTHOLD: I don`t. I think --\n\nHAYES: Congressman Farenthold. Sorry.\n\nFARENTHOLD: Yes. I don`t think it was at all. When you start a negotiation, you don`t go -- ask anybody in sales. You develop the relationship first, and that`s what Donald Trump is doing. Hillary Clinton doesn`t have the courage to go and talk to the president of Mexico --\n\nHAYES: You don`t think she`s talked --\n\nFARENTHOLD: -- because she knows she`ll have to --\n\nHAYES: -- to the president of Mexico?\n\nFARENTHOLD: -- get out in front of the press and answer questions.\n\nHAYES: Do you think Hillary Clinton has not talked to the president of Mexico?\n\nFARENTHOLD: She was invited. Donald Trump went, she hadn`t gone.\n\nHAYES: She has talked to the president of Mexico. She was the Secretary of State of the United States.\n\nFARENTHOLD: I`m sure she has in the past.\n\nHAYES: Right.\n\nFARENTHOLD: But the point is --\n\nHAYES: So let me ask you this, Congressman --\n\nFARENTHOLD: -- she didn`t take this opportunity to go because she would have had to answer questions from the press and she`s afraid to get in front of a camera because she doesn`t want to answer questions about the Clinton Foundation and all the other --\n\nHAYES: Congressman --\n\nFARENTHOLD: -- corruption associated with her.\n\nHAYES: Yes. Congressman, the Donald Trump plan to get Mexico to pay for the wall says they can get Mexico to pay for the wall in three days. Does that sound like the right time frame for you, three days?\n\nFARENTHOLD: Again, I don`t have Donald Trump`s negotiating skills. If he thinks he can do it --\n\nHAYES: You think he can do it in three days --\n\nFARENTHOLD: -- I`m going to take him at his word.\n\nHAYES: -- particularly given what happened with Pena Nieto today?\n\nFARENTHOLD: Listen, I don`t think it`s going to be as easy. But again, the fact of the matter is the people want the border secure. And Donald Trump is talking about --\n\nHAYES: What is --\n\nFARENTHOLD: --securing the border. We don`t hear Hillary Clinton talking about securing the border. She wants --\n\nHAYES: Will you give me a --\n\nFARENTHOLD: -- to continue Obama`s open border policies.\n\nHAYES: Can you give me a definition of a secure border?\n\nFARENTHOLD: Sure. When people aren`t getting across in drones --\n\nHAYES: Zero people?\n\nFARENTHOLD: -- like they are now.\n\nHAYES: (INAUDIBLE).\n\nFARENTHOLD: When we`re catching almost everybody who comes across, that`s the definition of a secure border.\n\nHAYES: We`re at a 15-year low on apprehensions. What would be the number? Is it zero crossings?\n\nFARENTHOLD: I don`t think you`ll ever get to zero, but I think you`ll get down to --\n\nHAYES: What`s the number?\n\nFARENTHOLD: -- we`re catching 95 to 99 percent.\n\nHAYES: Congressman Castro, do you feel the border is insecure?\n\nCASTRO: I believe and I know that we commit more resources to the border today than we ever have in American history. If you look at the numbers in the 1990`s, at one point there were about 1.4 million people coming across. Now it`s down to about 330,000. So we doubled the number of border patrol agents that we had since 2004 when President Bush was in office. Yes. So the fact is, Hillary Clinton has talked about securing the border, but she`s not going to get into all of this hysteria and all of the fear and resentment that Donald Trump has tried to create among the American people.\n\nHAYES: Yes. Let me just say as a final note that the Comprehensive Immigration Reform bill that was passed by the Senate and killed by Congressman Farenthold and his colleagues in the House, you can like it or not like it, it`s not an open borders bill, I think it`s fair to say. Representatives Blake Farenthold and Joaquin Castro, Texas. Gentlemen, thank you both for your time tonight. Appreciate it.\n\nJoining me now, former CBS Evening News anchor Dan Rather, managing editor and anchor of Dan Rather Reports on Access TV. Have you ever seen anything quite like what we saw today down in Mexico?\n\nDAN RATHER, EDITOR AND ANCHOR, DAN RATHER REPORTS: Absolutely not. I kind of feel like we`ve been parachuted into the Theatre of the Absurd. I don`t understand what happened today. Over the years, I`ve attended a lot of meetings between the president of the United States and the president of foreign powers. I do not recall any such meeting in which the two principals came out and told directly opposite stories --\n\nHAYES: Immediately.\n\nRATHER: -- contradicting stories immediately after the (INAUDIBLE). I don`t profess to understand this. I will say this about Donald Trump. We need to understand -- and I think a lot of people do understand -- that his strategy for winning the election, the core of it is to dominate every news cycle. And here again today, as quaky, as really mondo bizarro as this whole situation has been, once again Donald Trump is dominating --\n\nHAYES: Hmm.\n\nRATHER: -- the headlines and television coverage. Hillary Clinton today - - and I`m not praising her for it -- but Hillary Clinton today made a statement about defense of the United States, which (INAUDIBLE) required of the military. At least an attempt to deal with a serious and important subject. But Donald Trump -- and give him credit, if that`s the word -- he`s succeeded once again. He dominates any media landscape on any day and he`s done it again today, and that may be to his advantage.\n\nHAYES: I think that`s his greatest skill. And I think sometimes it`s been to an advantage and sometime it`s been to his disadvantage. And, you know, when he was dominating the media on calling an American judge, you know, unfit to judge him because he`s Hispanic.\n\nRATHER: Well, exactly. And I think it`s a fair analysis to say that he`s very seldom called to account --\n\nHAYES: Mm-hmm.\n\nRATHER: -- when one story doesn`t match the other story. Look --\n\nHAYES: Or he moves on.\n\nRATHER: -- we weren`t in the room. The American people will get to decide whom they think is telling the truth out of this meeting. The Mexican president says, I made it very clear we`re not going to pay for the wall. Donald Trump says, we didn`t discuss --\n\nHAYES: Right.\n\nRATHER: -- or mention the wall. People can make up their own mind of whom they think is more likely to be telling the truth.\n\nHAYES: There has been in the past -- I mean, I was trying to think of an analog today in terms of the setting here. I mean, you can imagine the political reception domestically if President Obama were to meet with a foreign candidate -- not a head of state, a candidate -- who had made central to their campaign whether it was they were running for office in Mexico or they`re running in France, that the Americans are terrible, that they`re fundamentally untrustworthy, that they`re sending rapists and murderers or warmongers or killers -- I mean, I know American politics and you know it as well as anyone, you can imagine what the reception would be.\n\nRATHER: Well, exactly. And that`s part of the many things I don`t understand about this meeting. This looked like a lose-lose situation for both the Mexican president --\n\nHAYES: Right.\n\nRATHER: -- and Donald Trump, particularly if Donald Trump was going to walk into the room and say, let me tell you one thing, (INAUDIBLE) --\n\nHAYES: Right.\n\nRATHER: -- you`re going to build the wall --\n\nHAYES: And you`re going to pay for it.\n\nRATHER: -- and you`re going to pay for it.\n\nHAYES: Yes, it doesn`t look like that happened, although who knows, maybe Pena Nieto`s wrong. It is interesting to me that, you know, when Barack Obama took that trip in 2008 abroad on the campaign trail, it was kind of a bold stroke.\n\nRATHER: Right.\n\nHAYES: And meant to sort of show people that he could be, you know, commander in chief. And --\n\nRATHER: Right.\n\nHAYES: -- John McCain also traveled abroad. He actually traveled to Mexico in 2012. Of course, he was sitting Senator. Mitt Romney traveled abroad in -- sorry, in 2012. Do you think this is now an institution of the American campaign?\n\nRATHER: That`s a very good question. It`s becoming an institution to do it. And obviously one of the reasons Donald Trump went to Mexico today, he`s meeting with a foreign power, looking presidential --\n\nHAYES: Right.\n\nRATHER: -- if you will. And you make a good point. In recent years, there`s been an effort to kind of institutionalize it. And guessing in the future, my guess is that future candidates are going to want to do the same thing. But depending on how this turns out for Donald Trump --\n\nHAYES: That`s exactly right.\n\nRATHER: -- it may not turn out all that well for him and it may give a future candidate a little pause in saying, you know what, maybe I better check my whole cards and not go.\n\nHAYES: There are huge risks involved. Of course, Dan Rather, a pleasure for your time. Thank you very much.\n\nRATHER: Thank you, Chris. Always.\n\nHAYES: Still to come, before hearing Donald Trump`s major immigration address -- that`s tonight, you`re not going to go anywhere -- we thought it would be helpful to do a pre-fact check of some of his more common immigration claims. That is coming up. But first, after insulting the nation for his entire campaign, look how the people of Mexico received the Republican nominee today. That`s right after this two-minute break.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHAYES: Perhaps this New York Times headline summed up the announcement of today`s meeting between Donald Trump and president Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico: Donald Trump to visit Mexico after more than a year of mocking it. Trump has made blaming Mexico for problems facing the U.S. one of the cornerstones of his candidacy. And his cascade of insults to the Mexican government, its court system and people, have not gone unnoticed in Mexico. Today the Mexican president came, though in a somewhat muted fashion, to the defense of his country`s citizens.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nENRIQUE PENA NIETO, PRESIDENT OF MEXICO (through translator): The Mexicans in the United States are honest people and hardworking. They are well- intentioned people. They are good people who respect the institution of the family and community life and who respect the law.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES: Trump is an almost universally reviled figure in Mexico as seen in the ubiquitous Trump pinatas for sale, which is one reason why his meeting with Pena Nieto was so puzzling. Joining me now is Francisco Goldman, a contributor to The New Yorker, author of The Interior Circuit: A Mexico City Chronicle. And Francisco, let`s start with this. I mean, you know if you travel as an American during campaign season, wherever you go people are tuned into the American political scene. How closely have Mexican media and Mexicans been following this campaign?\n\nFRANCISCO GOLDMAN, CONTRIBUTOR, THE NEW YORKER: Yes, they`ve followed it fairly closely, but not as closely as you would think. Basically, once they realized Trump is the villain, Trump insulted Mexico, Trump is obviously, you know, been running on a campaign that Mexicans interpret as a racist and xenophobic and ultra-nationalist and even fascistic -- it`s a word that`s often used here -- a campaign attacking Mexico and scapegoating Mexico. And that`s about where it ends, really. And of course a lot of it is turning him, in the very much Mexican way, into a figure of bula, a figure of making fun of Trump, of almost, you know, reveling in your almost joyous detestation --\n\nHAYES: Yes.\n\nGOLDMAN: -- of what he represents. And a lot of comedy. I don`t think people -- when it was first announced that Trump was even coming here, the first reaction was kind of astonishment. But it shouldn`t be confused with, you know, the way Mexicans might react to something they take much more seriously.\n\nHAYES: Yes.\n\nGOLDMAN: Such as the drug war.\n\nHAYES: My sense in terms of what I`ve been sort of consuming in terms of Mexican culture, particularly on Trump, this idea, this kind of, like -- both a villain but also sort of object of ridicule, almost sort of unanimously in a country that is incredibly politically divided at this moment. This kind of figure of sort of --\n\nGOLDMAN: Yes.\n\nHAYES: -- universal revulsion and mocking.\n\nGOLDMAN: That`s right. And, Chris, the country may be politically divided, but I would say don`t forget that this president, Enrique Pena Nieto, has the lowest approval ratings in this country in modern times and is equally a figure of fun and --\n\nHAYES: Right.\n\nGOLDMAN: -- mockery at this point than if -- you know, so it was really a -- like, to me from this morning when I first began to follow it, like a train wreck waiting to happen. And certainly I think we`re going to have a world, you know, the Mexican record in mocking, hilarious memes that`s coming over the next 24 hours without a doubt, you know.\n\nHAYES: Well, it seemed to me in terms of monitoring just watching Mexicans on Twitter last night just reacting to the news, this was incredibly --\n\nGOLDMAN: Yes.\n\nHAYES: -- high risk low reward for Pena Nieto, which is to say, you know, people feel insulted, they feel that he has to stand up for the honor of Mexico and its people and the integrity of its governments and its courts and everything. And anything less than a sort of reading him the riot act would be seen as essentially surrender. And it`s hard or me --\n\nGOLDMAN: Yes.\n\nHAYES: -- to think that the meeting is going to help him politically at all domestically. Maybe I`m wrong. What do you think?\n\nGOLDMAN: No. The meeting, the way it played out, has destroyed him, as my taxi driver on the way over here said. I saw my taxi driver go through all the stages of rage and resignation and finally a kind of fierce Mexican glee that that`s it, he will never recover from this. This is the noose around his neck and (INAUDIBLE) neck and they`re finally going to be gone because this is -- when we thought that you couldn`t go any lower, they finally hit bottom. I think that there was a lot of that kind of anticipatory mocking earlier. There was some very serious, important statements from very heavyweight Mexican intellectual and political authorities in the morning. I saw the person who had the longest term as Mexico`s ambassador to the U.S. saying, you know, what a political, moral mistake this is. You`re legitimizing that kind of racist statements and xenophobic statements that Trump had uttered even by inviting him here and granting him this sort of --\n\nHAYES: Yes.\n\nGOLDMAN: -- courtesy. So I think it was Enrique (INAUDIBLE), a conservative intellectual denouncing it in similar ways saying you don`t invite somebody you`ve compared to Hitler, as Pena Nieto had earlier, you know, into your house in this way. I saw someone else calling it the gravest Mexican diplomatic error in history. I myself watching this morning thought, he must have something up his sleeve. He must be setting a kind of trap. His approval ratings are so low, he`s so denigrated, he`s so disliked. I thought, he`s obviously going to try and recapture some kind of, you know, popularity here by really publicly standing up to Trump. That must be the agenda, but no --\n\nHAYES: Yes.\n\nGOLDMAN: -- that didn`t happen.\n\nHAYES: All right. Francisco Goldman, always a pleasure to hear from you from Mexico. Thank you very much for joining us. Appreciate it. Coming up, Hillary Clinton`s pitch to Republicans looking for a Trump alternative. Former Governor Jennifer Granholm joins me to discuss. That`s just ahead.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCLINTON: I know we can`t cozy up to dictators. We have to stand up to them. We can`t contain ISIS. We must defeat them, and we will.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES: In her speech to the American Legion today, Hillary Clinton issued a fairly standard line used by Americans heads of state that we shouldn`t cozy up to dictators. It`s a maxim often ignored by those American heads of state when it comes to certain dictators who are American allies. As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton herself said with regard to Hosni Mumbarak who kept an iron grip on Egypt for nearly 30 years before his ousting in 2011, quote, I really consider President and Mrs. Mumbarak to be friends of my family, so I hope to see them often here in Egypt and in the U.S. U.S. government has also been a steadfast ally to the un-democratic and oppressive regime of Saudi Arabia. And not just an ally, the U.S. has been supplying arms to the Saudis at record levels. Since 2010, the Obama administration authorized a record 60 billion dollars in U.S. military sales to Saudi Arabia, arms that had then been used to wage an air war in the country of Yemen indiscriminately targeting civilians. According to the United Nations, the Saudi-led military coalition in Yemen was responsible for some 60 percent of the 1,953 child deaths and injuries there during the past year. Human Rights Watch pointing out that aerial strikes had hit schools, hospitals, markets and homes, and that includes areas specifically designated off-limits. According to the New York Times, the United States included a bridge on a no strike list of vital infrastructure explicitly informing the Saudis that it was critical to responding to the humanitarian crises in Yemen. And yet the Saudi-led coalition obliterated the structure. The air strikes have been going on for over a year with basically no domestic political outcry. But finally members of congress are speaking up about the ghastly moral abomination that is the Saudi war on Yemen. Sixty-four legislators signed a bipartisan letter asking the Obama Administration to halt the sale of more than a billion dollars worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia. The letter, noting that in June, 204 House members voted to block the transfer of cluster bombs to Saudi Arabia after reports of their use in civilian areas in Yemen. It was not enough to stop the transfer. America is the largest arms exporter in the world, just one of the many ways we`re an exceptional nation. What Hillary Clinton said about her foreign policy position today, including her version of American exceptionalism next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHAYES: Today, Hillary Clinton delivered a speech that in many respects could have been delivered by a Republican, even a neo-conservative. For instance, this line about leadership.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCLINTON: The United States is an exceptional nation. I believe we are still Lincoln`s last, best hope of Earth. We`re still Reagan`s shining city on a hill. We`re still Robert Kennedy`s great, unselfish, compassionate country.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES: Now, there was a line Clinton uttered about what happens if America`s allows a leadership vacuum.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCLINTON: Because when America fails to lead, we leave a vacuum that either causes chaos or other countries or networks rush in to fill the void.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES: If that language sounded familiar, here`s what Republican Senator Marco Rubio said at the Ronald Reagan dinner in October 2014.\n\n(BEIGN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. MARCO RUBIO, (R) FLORIDA: So from a national security perspective, the absence of America leadership leaves a vacuum that leads to chaos, and we`re seeing it play out in every region of this planet.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES: Clinton`s calls for American leadership have already brought a long line of ndorsements from Republican security officials from past administrations.\n\nToday, the campaign added another one, James Clad, former deputy assistant secretary under President George W. Bush.\n\nJoining me now, Jennifer Granholm, former governor of Michigan and co-chair of Hillary Clinton`s transition team.\n\nTo those who are wary in the Democratic Party in the center-left or across the political spectrum about how Hillary Clinton approaches the projection of American forces and the use of military force, what can you say to reassure them in the wake of rhetoric that sounds very much like some of the most sort of hawkish voices in American public discourse, endorsements from a lot of those folks and a record of supporting a fair amount of military intervention?\n\nJENNIFER GRANHOLM, FRM. GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN: Well, I`d say two things, Chris. One is this: Hillary Clinton is giving Democrats an ability to be patriotic. I say this as an immigrant to this country. And whether your people were brought here by the Amistad or whether they flew here in American Airlines or came across the Arizona border, our diversity if our American exceptionalism and she referred to the diversity of the military. But that -- it allows Democrats to define American exceptionalism our way, our convention, where we were all waving the American flag. It`s been hard as a Democrat to see Republicans embrace that and sort of take it from us.\n\nNow Democrats are saying, we are exceptional, and we`re going to define it our way. And that means we`re going to define it our way in terms of what makes this country great, in terms of how we project ourselves across the world.\n\nShe talked about how important it was when we went in to get Osama bin Laden, that we didn`t just wipe out his family, that we, because of our values and who we are, got them out of there safely.\n\nOur projection across the world is not just us leading, it is us pulling people along together.\n\nSo for Democrats to be proud of being patriotic, to be proud of being American, it`s a big gift to us as a party.\n\nHAYES: Well, I mean, look, I think most people in American politics in the highest reaches and most people who run for president think America is an exceptional nation. I think that -- if you polled members of congress, that`s a consensus view. It`s a view I think most Americans probably share. I think the definition of that could be a little bit difficult to pin down, frankly, but on this question of leadership, I mean, what struck me about sort of putting the Hillary Clinton and the Marco Rubio thoughts together, those sound bites together was, that has been a call from critics of this president, that American -- America has not led under President Obama.\n\nAnd I can`t tell if this rhetoric from Hillary Clinton ismeant to sort of subtly distance herself from some of the aggressive restraint, to use a phrase, that the president has sort of promulgated as president.\n\nGRANHOLM: I don`t think she`s distancing from him at all. I think she`s helping to explain and say where she`s going to take it to the next level.\n\nI mean her definition of American exceptionalism, it`s not just that we are the biggest economy or that we`re the most powerful military, or, you know, any of that -- or that we`ve got the most robust GDP, it is because we use our assets to benefit the world. It is because we are not shrinking in the face of what are global threats, that we are linking arms with other countries and using all of those great things about us to be able to make the world a better place.\n\nProgressives should feel really good about that.\n\nHAYES: All right. Jennifer Granholm, thank you for your time tonight. Appreciate it.\n\nGRANHOLM: You bet.\n\nHAYES: Coming up, previewing Trump`s immigration speech and the stark contrast to Clinton`s policies. And tonight`s Thing one, Thing two is also coming up next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHAYES: Thing One tonight, we`re approaching that time of year where your TV gets inundated with political ads, from political campaigns down to state races. For instance, Iowans may start seeing this ad from Republican candidate Waylon Brown who is running for state senate, which he`s shown talking and listening to Iowa voters, including these kids at school with their teacher.\n\nBut what`s weird about this interaction is that another Iowa candidate spoke to the same teacher and those same kids, and so did these other guys. Why are all these candidates meeting with the same kids? That`s Thing 2 in 60 seconds.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHAYES: We`ve covered on this show the delightfully amusing micros-genre of political campaigns using or misusing stock footage in their ads. But now it appears the Iowa GOP has gone a step further. As the political news site Iowa Starting Line pointed out today, all GOP state senate candidates have the same kids in their ads. And so it looks like all these candidates embarked on the same listening tour of the same hallway, in the same school, with the same kids.\n\nThe Iowa Republican Party apparently scheduled the day of film shoots to save time and money and then just swapped their candidates into the frame. Most likely voters won`t notice, except, as Iowa Starting Line notes, nearly all of these candidates are in the same media market.\n\nSo if any of these ads run do happen to run back to back, it might look a bit awkward.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHAYES: We`ve all spent the last few weeks tying ourselves into knots, trying to figure out exactly what Donald Trump`s immigration policy is. While Hillary Clinton`s policy, whether you agree with it or not, has been clearly laid out in speeches and on her website, Clinton says she`ll introduce comprehensive immigration legislation which would include a path way to citizenship.\n\nShe would defend President Obama`s executive actions on the issue. Make it easier for people to become naturalized citizens and change current detention policies.\n\nJoining me now, Lorella Praeli, national Latino vote director for Hillary for America.\n\nLorella, do you feel like -- what do you make of the last few weeks of Donald Trump`s immigration policy trajectory as he heads into the speech tonight? Can you hear me there, Lorella?\n\nLORELLA PRAELI, HILLARY FOR AMERICA: Hi, Chris.\n\nHAYES: Hey, sorry.\n\nSo what do you make of these last few weeks of Donald Trump on immigration as he heads into the speech tonight?\n\nPRAELI: I think that nothing has changed. I mean, what we`ve seen Donald Trump and his campaign try to do over the last few weeks is distract people from his dangerous policies. I mean, he went to Mexico today with that intention, to distract us and to change headlines. And what we know out of what has happened is that in his signature policy issue, which is to build a concrete giant wall along the southern border, he went into a room, got beat, and then lied about it.\n\nAnd so what we know today is who Donald Trump has been from day one of his campaign, Chris. He is for massive deportation. He is for putting DREAMers on a path to deportation, he is for banning entrance of a full religion into our country, 1.5 billion people.\n\nAnd so this is Donald Trump being Donald Trump. And I guess for me, for my own personal experience and the way I approach this work, I think the damage has already been done. There`s nothing that Donald Trump can say today or in the next 70 days to undo the damage that he`s done throughout the last 14 months of his campaign.\n\nHAYES: What do you say to people who say, look, what if he ends up in this position, which he sort of seems to flirt with is -- we`re going to prioritize people with criminal convictions for deportation, which is not that different from what President Obama has done. Of course President Obama has -- there have been record deportations under President Obama, and tries to essentially move closer to the Hillary Clinton position?\n\nPRAELI: I don`t buy it, Chris. When you have someone that`s spent the last 14 months and launched his campaign by calling Mexicans rapists and criminals and then has used every opportunity that he has had to talk about this issue, to criminalize and demonize people like my sister, people like my mother, people who I know and grew up with, when he has used every moment to do that, I just don`t believe it.\n\nHe could say he`s for passing immigration reform tonight in Arizona and I wouldn`t buy it. We have 14 months of his rhetoric. The damage has already been done. The dangerous policies could happen if he`s president. And so I say we`re not buying it, the American people are not buying it, Latino voters are not buying it, and we`re ready to go out and fight back.\n\nHAYES: All right, Lorella Praeli, thank you for your time tonight. Appreciate it.\n\nAs we await Trump`s big immigration speech, we have some important fact- checking of his more frequent claims on immigration. That`s coming up after this break.\n\nBut first, and this is important, my kids are here tonight, visiting the studio. So loyal viewers know what that means, it`s time for their animal video requests. My daughter Ryan asked for a video of an elephant. So, here is an elephant at the Dallas Zoo, moving a 500- pound log around her habitat using her trunk. My son David has asked for a video of a rhinoceros.\n\nSo, here`s a black rhino just kind of hanging out in the St. Louis Zoo, not really doing any heavy lifting, just sort of strolling.\n\nWe`re All In when we come back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHAYES: We are just minutes away from Donald Trump`s big immigration speech in Phoenix, Arizona. For the past 14 months, Trump has built his presidential brand on fear mongering over the issue, I think it`s safe to say. Describing our southern border as being overrun by undocumented immigrants with people pouring into the country and only a wall paid for by Mexico can possibly stop all the chaos.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: Do you remember when I ran, when I announced, I talked about illegal immigration. I talked about people pouring in to our country. And just look at the record numbers of people right now that are pouring across the borders of this country.\n\nThe border is a disaster, Bill. People are pouring in and I mean illegal people, illegal immigrants, and they`re pouring in.\n\nOur country is out of control. People are pouring across the southern border. I will build a wall. It will be a great wall. People will not come in unless they come in legally.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES: All right, the reality is that fewer immigrants are entering the U.S. illegally than at any time in the recent past. According to The Washington Post, evidence is emerging illegal immigration flows have fallen to their lowest level in at least two decades. The Pew Research Center estimating that after years of steady increases, the population of undocumented immigrants in this country has leveled off.\n\nAnd by the way, there already is a wall. You`re already paying for it, in fact. NBC News reporting that American taxpayers have spent billions of dollars on border security, including a 700-mile-long physical barrier along the southern border with Mexico. Border security spending has , get this, increased 1,400 percent over the past 15 years and all that security has made it more difficult for people to actually cross the border.\n\nApprehensions at the border are at a 15-year low. And those are just a few of the many examples of how Trump`s rhetoric on immigration is at odds with reality. Joining me now with fact check some of Trump`s assertions on immigration are Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton who joins from outside the Trump event in Phoenix, and Javier Palamarez, president and CEO of U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Congress.\n\nAnd Mayor Stanton, let me start with you outside that venue there. I mean, one of the big themes for Donald Trump is that Mexico represents essentially a kind of hostile power, a rival, an enemy. Is that your view from where you stand as the mayor of Phoenix, very close to that border?\n\nGREG STANTON, MAYOR OF PHOENIX, ARIZONA: Just the opposite. Phoenix is lucky to be close to Mexico and our southern border. As you know, Mexico has a fast-growing economy. Right now, there the 12th or 13th largest economy on Planet Earth, soon to be growing to the fifth or sixth largest over the next 20 years. They have a growing Middle Class. That`s a great opportunity for trade for our local companies.\n\nWe have over 90,000 jobs here in our region that are directly tied to trade with Mexico. So I don`t want to build walls with Mexico, I want to build economic bridges with Mexico, and having greater economic ties with Mexico is nothing but a great thing for our local economy here in Phoenix, and Arizona.\n\nSo I think Donald Trump has it all wrong in how he`s perceived our relationship with Mexico.\n\nHAYES: Javier, let me ask you -- let me ask you this, because you`ve had the experience of a meeting with Donald Trump on immigration like Pena Nieto just went through, about almost exactly a year ago.\n\nHow are you viewing what happened today through that prism?\n\nJAVIER PALOMAREZ, U.S. HISPANIC CHAMBER OF COMMERCE: Well, I`m not surprised at all that the private Donald Trump is quite different from the public Donald Trump.\n\nAs you know, we met almost a year to the day for the first time after I had just spoken to Donald Trump. He was very courteous to me and then doubled down in his hate-filled rhetoric. The reality of it is, this man has predicated his entire campaign on two things: building a wall and the fact that Mexico would pay for that wall. He has built this movement of hate and now he`s having to try to figure out how do I do exactly what Javier Palomarez warned me I should do, is start to court the Hispanic vote in America.\n\nHAYES: Mayor, one of the other things that Donald Trump really stresses is to focus on immigrants as a kind of distinct criminal threat. That he will take individual cases of unauthorized immigrants committing a felony or violent crimes, talks about that constantly. Obviously, you have a large undocumented population there in Phoenix. Is that how the reality plays out on the ground in Phoenix?\n\nSTANTON: No, it`s not. In fact, no city in the United States of America would benefit more from comprehensive immigration reform than Phoenix, Arizona. That`s why our two senators, Senator McCain and Senator Flake, in a bipartisan way, supported tough but fair comprehensive immigration reform. We`ve got to get people out of the shadows and fully involved in our economy. It would be great for our local economy. So instead of telling disaster stories or trying to scare people, we need to deal with it in a mature way and tell it accurate information.\n\nThat immigration reform, comprehensive immigration reform, will be great for the American economy, certainly great for my city.\n\nHAYES: The big question here, and this is the thing that everyone is looking to see, is where he ends up on the question, the hardest question. 11 million people who live here, what do you do with those folks. How have you reacted to them essentially try to avoid the question?\n\nPALOMEREZ: Well, I want to just say, Chris, that I could not agree more with Mayor Stanton. He`s absolutely dead on. We need to stay focused on the fact that as we stand today, Mexico represents close to $600 billion of bilateral trade with America. I agree with him, I agree with my dear friend John McCain, I agree with my good friend Jeff Flake. All of us are in agreement that Mexico is an important trade partner with the United States, more than six million American jobs depend on that bilateral trade.\n\nNothing could be further from the truth, this myth -- in fact,it`s not even a myth, it`s a lie that Donald Trump has perpetrated that says that there`s this is tsunami of Mexicans coming across the border, taking our wives, and our children, and our jobs. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nThe United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce collaborated on a joint study with the George W. Bush Institute and that study found as recently as 2010, that net migration between the United States and Mexico, which is a look at the number of people leaving the U.S. going to Mexico and leaving Mexico and coming to the U.S. was practically zero.\n\nFor a five-year period of time, nations of this size, it was less than 20,000 people. And in fact, it was 20,000 more people leaving America going to Mexico than leaving Mexico coming to America.\n\nIt is an absolute lie. It`s subterfuge. It is something that he has created, and perpetrated, and continued to propagate to build this movement of hatred.\n\nHAYES: Yeah. And quickly, mayor, that wall is never going to get built, is it?\n\nSTANTON: Well, I know there`s this debate about whether or not -- you know, who said they`re going to pay for the wall, or whether Mexico is going to pay for the wall. The wall shouldn`t be built. The wall would be a very dumb thing to build. We want to build bridges, economic bridges, bridges of friendship of support with Mexico. We don`t want to build a wall. That would be very dumb. We could be smart about this. And we don`t want to engage in public policy that is self defeating for our local economy. The wall is a bad idea.\n\nHAYES: As Benjamin Conkol (ph), the writer, said today it`s a heck of a joke for a guy to fly in a private jet between two neighboring countries twice in one day in order to promote a wall between those two countries.\n\nJavier Palomerez, Mayor Greg Stanton, thank you very much.\n\nAnd that is ALL IN for this evening.\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

They were all black men, ages 19 to 43, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune . One victim was shot in the stomach needed surgery, the Black Lives Matter local group in Minneapolis said Tuesday.\n\nRELATED: Rahm Emanuel: Killer cop took 'law into his own hands'\n\nThe shooting happened about a block away from the Minneapolis Police Department 4th Precinct, where Black Lives Matter demonstrators and local activists have camped for more than a week after 24-year-old Jamar Clark was shot dead by a police officer during a scuffle on November 15.\n\n\"Dozens of officers responded almost immediately attending to victims and secured the scene,\" the police statement said early Tuesday. \"Additional resources were called in and are actively investigating the shootings, interviewing a multitude of witnesses.\"\n\nWitness Jie Wronski-Riley, 19, told NBC News via telephone that a group of three men was \"yelling and being aggressive and it was obvious they were here to antagonize and confront people.\"\n\nAround 25 of the protesters started \"escorting\" the three people away from the area when there was a \"conflict between the two groups,\" Wronski-Riley said.\n\nMost of the protesters broke off but around four of them kept on up the street to ensure the three men would not come back. Wronski-Riley said that at this point the men \"turned around and without warning and started shooting at us ... everything was super chaotic.\"\n\nMinneapolis' Black Lives Matter group were among dozens claiming on Twitter that the shooters were \"white supremacists.\"\n\n\"What happened last night was a planned hate crime,\" the group said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nRELATED: Judge orders release of controversial police shooting video\n\nAsked about the allegations swirling on social media, Minneapolis Police Department spokesman John Elder said it was \"way too early in this investigation\" to make a statement about claims the shooters were white supremacists.\n\n\"I have heard a dozen different theories, and as part of our investigation we will investigate every one of these until we can ascertain which one is applicable,\" he told NBC News.\n\nBlack Lives Matter Minneapolis chided the police Tuesday for not protecting protesters.\n\n\"We reiterate that we have zero faith in this police department's desire to keep us safe,\" the group said.\n\nThe shooting happened near a protest camp over the police shooting of Jamar Clark earlier this month. According to police, Clark was a suspect in an assault and was interfering with paramedics who were trying to treat a victim. It is unclear whether Clark was handcuffed during the scuffle.\n\nThe Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, the state agency investigating his death, is looking into whether he was restrained. The FBI is also conducting a civil rights investigation.\n\nClark's death set off more than a week of protests, some of which turned violent .\n\nMinnesota Gov. Mark Dayton told reporters Monday that he had seen video of the incident, but said it provided no conclusive evidence of whether the shooting was justified.\n\n\"There's nothing in there that's going to provide any confirmation for this view that the officers acted as some allege they did,\" Dayton said.\n\nIn light of the shootings late Monday, Clark's brother, Eddie Sutton, called for an end to the protest encampment.\n\n\"Thank you to the community for the incredible support you have shown for our family in this difficult time. We appreciate Black Lives Matter for holding it down and keeping the protests peaceful,\" Sutton said in a statement released early Tuesday. \"But in light of tonight's shootings, the family feels out of imminent concern for the safety of the occupiers, we must get the occupation of the 4th Precinct ended and onto the next step.\"\n\nNBC News' Elizabeth Chuck contributed to this story, which originally appeared on NBCNews.com\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

I`m Steve Kornacki.  Chris Matthews will be back here on Monday.  Thank you for joining us and \"ALL IN\" with Chris Hayes starts right now.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCHRIS HAYES, MSNBC HOST:  Tonight on ALL IN.\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  You know what I know about Alex, he was a great student at Harvard, he`s Hispanic which I -- which I so admire.\n\nHAYES:  A big loss for the president as yet another cabinet member resigns and disgraced.\n\nTRUMP:  He`s a Hispanic man, he went to Harvard, a great student.\n\nHAYES:  Trump`s Labor Secretary is out thanks to a deal he cut with sex predator Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nTRUMP:  I wasn`t a big fan of Jeffrey Epstein, that I can tell you.  And now if you look, the remnants hurt this man.\n\nHAYES:  Tonight, new scrutiny of all the President`s men amid news his Acting Labor Secretary was a sweatshop lobbyist.\n\nTRUMP:  I think you know Pat.  He`s a good man, highly recommend.\n\nHAYES:  Then, new calls for a complete overhaul of border patrol after the head of the agency is linked to a notorious Facebook group.\n\nREP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD):  Top Border Patrol officials have been aware of the Facebook group and it`s egregious contents for many months and even years.\n\nHAYES:  And just one day after caving on the census, Trump tries to spin his defeat.\n\nTRUMP:  Not only didn`t I back down, I backed up.\n\nHAYES:  When ALL IN starts right now.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES:  Good evening from New York, I`m Chris Hayes.  We begin with breaking news tonight.  Shocking new pictures tonight from the Trump detention camps on the southern border.  Images of men tightly packed into cages as Vice President Mike Pence visited the border on what was supposed to be something of a PR tour.\n\nThe administration disputing reports of horrific conditions for migrants.  That`s what they say, this is the reality as Washington Post reporter Josh Dawsey who was there wrote \"the pool was taken into an outdoor porter at the McAllen border station around 5 p.m. where almost 400 men were in caged fences with no cots.  The stench was horrendous.  When the men saw the press arrived, they began shouting and wanted to tell us they`ve been in there 40 days or longer.\"\n\n\"The men said they were hungry and wanted to brush their teeth.  It was sweltering hot.  Agents were guarding the cages wearing face masks.  Most of the men did not speak English and looked dirty.  They said they`ve been there for 40 days or more upon questioning from the pool.\"\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are not a terrorist.  We are not a terrorist.  We are not a criminal.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES:  Joining me now, Jonathan Ryan, CEO and President of RAICES which is the largest immigration legal services provider in Texas.  Jonathan, I know your organization has represented people who have been in this facility and others like it.  Is this what you`ve been hearing about what the conditions are like?\n\nJONATHAN RYAN, CEO AND PRESIDENT, RAICES:  Consistently and for many years, Chris.  You and I first met actually down in McAllen outside I believe probably of the same -- this same station.  And I`ve spoken with individuals from Somalia 15 years ago about these facilities.  I`ve spoken with Central American children this year about these facilities.  And their accounts are consistent and they are horrific.\n\nThe things that take place are beyond the conditions that you see on your T.V. screens which show people packed in with no pillows, no comforters, you can even see the water coolers placed conveniently outside of the place where they`re accessible to these individuals.  but frankly, it gets much worse than that.\n\nThe treatment that we hear about from the officers themselves indicates not an aberration from training but truly training itself.  Rough treatment, bodychecks, disgusting language, it`s all common things inside of these facilities because that is the culture, and frankly, this is what these facilities exist to do, to further terrorize immigrants and frankly to make them give up their rights so that lawyers such as those at RAICES are unable to help them to get the protection that they deserve.\n\nHAYES:  So one of the things -- you talked about the duration for which these facilities have been terrible which we`ve had many people who cover this peat for a long time who said that.  One of the things that seems to me new and different here are the duration of time that we`re hearing individuals detained in what are essentially makeshift facilities that are supposed to hold people for 72 hours.\n\nWhat do you say about the fact that we`re hearing people with 20 and 40 days in pens of 400 people with nowhere to sleep?\n\nRYAN:  It`s true that the conditions that we see today have been around for many years.  But it`s also absolutely the case that what we`re seeing now is a scaled up, toughened up, and unfortunately more streamlined in its own devious way and devastating way to cause more harm to more people.\n\nWe`ve never seen anything like the images that are coming out from today`s visit.  And to your point is if this was to have been constructed as a P.R. opportunity, I think it appears to have blown up in the face of the vice- president significantly because I am shocked even knowing what I know, I`m shocked by the images that I`ve seen.\n\nHAYES:  Jonathan Ryan of RAICES Texas which provides a legal support and representation for many of the migrants down at the border who are seeking asylum, which is, of course, legal under U.S. law.  Jonathan, thank you very much.\n\nRYAN:  Thank you.\n\nHAYES:  Before -- joining me now, Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii who was a Member of the Judiciary Committee.  Senator, your reaction to the images that we`re seeing from the visit of the Vice President and some of your colleagues.  In fact, the chair of your committee if I`m not mistaken Lindsey Graham was in there, Mike Lee as well who I believe is on your committee as well.  They were down there during this trip.  What`s your reaction to this?\n\nSEN.  MAZIE HIRONO (D-HI):  Well, based on what your -- the prior person just said, they saw the tremendous overcrowding.  I heard people shouting they`re not criminals, tremendous overcrowding which is what their own I.G. that they -- has said.  Dangerous overcrowding, extended stays in these facilities would endanger the health and safety of these people and that`s what`s going on.\n\nAnd if in fact, this is what they saw, I`d be very curious to hear what Vice President Pence and Chairman Lindsey Graham have to say because -- what, are they going to say everything`s great, you know everything`s done -- going great which is how the president describes what`s going on in the border.\n\nHAYES:  Yes.  The president spoke early this morning.  I don`t know if we have that tape and that -- I want to show you what the President had to say this morning about the trip and the conditions in the facilities.  Take a listen.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP:  Today in a few hours, Vice President Pence and the head of Homeland Security are taking the press and Congresspeople into detention center.  And we`re the ones that said they were crowded.  They are crowded because we have a lot of people.  But they`re in good shape.  We`re taking a tours there.  I`d love to be there but I`m going to Ohio, Wisconsin --\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES:  They`re in good shape and this is what -- this is what the Vice President has to say.  He tweeted this if we have that tweet.  He -- this is what he had to say after he -- after he visited the facility, we`ll get that tweet in a second.  What do you want to say to the president after seeing these images?\n\nHIRONO:  These are images very similar to what we have seen before where the administration kept saying and of course the President is saying that these facilities are being run well and that nobody is deprived of anything.  So these are images comport much more closely than with what we`ve all been seeing that there`s tremendous overcrowding.\n\nAnd at the same time, here`s an administration that thinks that by being cruel to people especially the children and these facilities, that`s going to stop people from coming over, at the same time cutting hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to the northern triangle countries where most of these people are coming from.\n\nSo the cruelty that is being subjected -- that we`re seeing is unconscionable and I`m just wondering you know, are you trying to find what Pence said because I don`t know how anybody can go to a place like that where the smell, the heat, the overcrowding is obvious.  And what exactly did Pence say about the conditions there?\n\nHAYES:  He said that -- something to the effect that even under great overcrowding, that the conditions were humane.  \"Toured the Donna Processing Center, the Second Lady saw firsthand how even the face of our overwhelmed facilities, CBP is providing humane and compassionate care.  Congress must reform our laws to end this unsustainable crisis of illegal immigration of the border.\"  Humane and compassionate.\n\nHIRONO:  They must have a very different definition of humane and compassionate where people are incarcerated basically and they don`t have access to showers, they don`t have some other basic necessities.  They have a very different definition of humane and compassionate.\n\nHAYES:  What is -- your colleagues, I don`t know where your vote was on that $4.6 billion supplemental package to DHS but it passes broad bipartisan support in the Senate.  There are some controversy in the House but it passed there and was sign into law.  There`s a question now of is the problem your capacity of money or is it something deeper about the culture of CBP and ICE so you keep particularly running facilities like this.  What is your view?\n\nHIRONO:  It`s both.  Obviously, there`s a culture of I would say cruelty and sadism, I would say, in these facilities, not by everyone of course.  But when you have conditions like that where people are all smashed together and the president keeps talking about these migrants as less than human, I think that you create an environment where certain kinds of behaviors and statements that are very detrimental and not regarding these people as human beings comes to the fore, and that`s what`s happening.\n\nHAYES:  Senator Mazie Hirono, thank you so much for being with me.  One small just addendum to what I just said.  The president -- the vice president`s tweet was about the Donna Processing Center.  That`s another facility than this center which is at McAllen which we saw.  Although one can imagine that the conditions aren`t surprisingly different there and we have not heard any comment here.\n\nJosh Dawsey who is the pool reporter from the Washington Post who was there who I should say to his credit was on full duty and according to his full report, negotiated with the Vice President`s staff and the Secret Service to be let into this facility which was not -- if I understand his reporting, the pool report initially on the tour.  Kudos to Josh and to the crew that got in there.\n\nHe talked to the vice-president afterwards.  The vice-president basically said he wasn`t surprised by what he saw.  These horrifying pictures come just hours after the Acting Inspector General of DHS testified before Congress about the terrible conditions they`ve seen and the dangers of those conditions pose.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJENNIFER COSTELLO, ACTING INSPECTOR GENERAL, DHS:  Our recent unannounced inspections revealed a situation far more grievous than those previously encountered by our inspectors.  For instance, when our team arrived at the El Paso del Norte Processing Center, they found that the facility which has a maximum capacity of 125 detainees had more than 750 detainees on-site.  The following day that number increased to 900.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES:  Also testifying at that oversight hearing, several members of Congress who have been inside some of those facilities who described what they saw through their colleagues and clearly as Senator of Hirono was just saying, there`s a combination of factors in play including an actual appreciable uptake in border apprehensions of people seeking asylum, and a culture at Customs and Border Protection that seems frankly at least from the outside and for the news we`re getting pretty rotten to its core.\n\nJust last week for example, ProPublica reported on a Facebook group for current and former border agents filled with sexist memes and mockery of immigrant deaths.  At the time, U.S. Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost said \"these posts are completely inappropriate and contrary to the honor, integrity I see and expect from our agents day in day out.\n\nBut get this.  In a new piece out today, the Intercept found that not only was Provost a member of that same Facebook group, she even commented on a post albeit not on any of the racist or sexist content.  The Intercept report she has since left the group.  Here with me now to talk about what`s gone so wrong with the culture at CBP Ryan Devereaux, the Intercept reporter who broke that story and Jenn Budd who is a former Senior Border Patrol Agent.\n\nRyan, I want to come to you a second.  Jenn, I want to begin with you.  You worked for CBP.  You served as an agent.  What is your reaction to what we`re learning now and what you are seeing in these images and the Vice President today and the OIG reports?\n\nJENN BUDD, FORMER BORDER PATROL AGENT:  Well, first I need to be clear that I was a Border Patrol Agent under the prior system before CBP came about but it is the same agency that in the Border Patrol and it is the same environment and the same culture.\n\nBut when I see these pictures, I honestly, Chris, I`ve never seen anything like this before in my life.  Those detention facilities I`ve seen and I know them well, their processing centers, but they`re kind of like a drunk tank and that they just have one toilet and then they just have some bench seats, but they`re not meant to hold anybody more than even really honestly 24 hours.\n\nHAYES:  Yes.  And we`re hearing people 40-day, yelling 40 days.  Ryan, you`ve been doing a reporting on the culture of this place.  Tell me about this Facebook group and how the Acting Director was involved in it?\n\nRYAN DEVEREAUX, REPORTER, THE INTERCEPT:  Well, the Facebook group was called I`m 10-15.  It`s since had its name changed.  It`s been archived but I managed to get access to the group several weeks ago and we started archiving hundreds of posts in the group.  And those post sort of reveal the culture inside CBP, inside the Border Patrol specifically when agents feel like they`re not being watched.\n\nIt`s an invite-only group so folks are in there kind of expressing their unvarnished opinions about a lot of things.  A lot of meme sharing.  In a lot of ways, it`s sort of indistinguishable from kind of the worst right- wing content you might find on the internet except this is populated by current and former federal law enforcement officials.\n\nHAYES:  Including the acting head of the agency?\n\nDEVEREAUX:  That`s correct.  So we were able to find a post from Carla Provost, the Chief of the Border Patrol in November 2018, three months after she took over the agency officially in which as you -- as you mentioned, it was a rather innocuous quote, but what it shows is that she was a member of this group, knew that this group existed, participated in this group.  And she`s one of several supervisors that we`ve been able to identify who took part in this -- in this group.\n\nHAYES:  Oh so it`s not just her, there are other supervisors you have identified who were part of this group?\n\nDEVEREAUX:  We found three supervisors of whole sectors and then several law stationed patrol agents in charge.\n\nHAYES:  Jenn, are you surprised to hear about the tenor of some of the racist, sexist, and really kind of vile memes have been on this message board?\n\nBUDD:  No, I`m not surprised at all.  And honestly, that`s what I`m used to seeing from the Border Patrol.  It was that way back when I entered in 95 and it`s always been that way.  And it`s just gotten worse over time.\n\nAnd frankly when they first you know, responded to this with their press release saying they didn`t know anything about it, and then not too long after that they released a second press release stating that they had known about it for years and that they were monitoring it, my first response on Twitter was I think maybe they`re saying that because we`re going to find out that some higher-ups are on it and they`re going to try and say that they were monitoring it.\n\nAnd so I`m not surprised at all that she was on this.  It`s shameful and it`s disgusting.\n\nHAYES:  What is your reporting indicate about the culture of this agency at this moment when it is clear -- I mean, we should be clear there the numbers really are up.  It really is under strain.  They are detaining more people.  They are apprehending more people.  There are more families coming at the border.  That is a real actual empirical fact in the world that`s changed in terms of what CBP had been doing which was largely for a long time apprehending people trying to cross in an unauthorized fashion who were single man. This is a different thing starting 2014 getting worse now.  Where is this agency right now?\n\nDEVEREAUX:  Yes so it`s been interesting monitoring the Facebook group up until it was exposed last week over the last month and a half or so.  It seen a sort of rising level of anger and frustration.  I mean, which was always sort of part of the group but it is really -- it really sort of it hit, a sort of fever pitch in the -- in the last few weeks especially as the sort of conversation around concentration camps heated up, and you saw a lot more posts about that, a lot more posts about Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortes, her visits to the border.\n\nShe became a sort of obsession on the group.  And we saw a lot of posts shared about her, a lot of very vulgar and violent posts shared about her.  And I should add, it wasn`t just memes that were that we`re seeing in here.  We see group members complaining about times they weren`t able to use lethal force on the job and how they`re not going to make that mistake again.  There were users joking about roasting migrant kids alive in the sort of mylar blankets that they`re given in detention centers.\n\nIt was a lot of really aggressively violent content.  And also users sort of playing a game in which they would share the \"stupid Central American name that they`d come -- they come across in a detention center, and then sharing and identifying information from migrants who had been brought into custody to sort of one-up each other.  So it was a really ugly culture that sort of developed on this -- in this secret Facebook group.\n\nHAYES:  All right, Ryan Devereaux, fantastic reporting, Jenn Budd, thank you both for your time tonight.  I really do appreciate it.  Ahead there is late-breaking news on the timing of Robert Mueller`s testimony for Congress.  And next a big loss to the President as the Labor Secretary finally resigns after outrage over the plea deal that he cut with sex predator Jeffrey Epstein.  The fallout from the Epstein scandal continues and that is next.  Don`t go anywhere.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHAYES:  The man who cut a secret non-prosecution agreement with a known sex predator will soon be out of a job.  That would be U.S. Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta.  It was announced today that he is resigning effective next Friday over criticism of the lenient treatment he gave to Jeffrey Epstein when he was a US Attorney in Florida more than a decade ago.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nALEX ACOSTA, SECRETARY OF LABOR, UNITED STATES:  I do not think it is right and fair for this administration`s Labor Department to have Epstein as the focus rather than the incredible economy that we have today.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES:  Epstein pled not guilty in New York Monday on charges that include sex trafficking of underage girls.  He faces up to 45 years in prison.  Prosecutors saying he abused dozens of girls some as young as 14.  Today prosecutors accused him of witness tampering, saying that Epstein paid 350,000 to tamper with potential witnesses against him.\n\nEpstein had faced similar charges in Florida but served just 13 months in prison with work release privileges thanks to the deal that Acosta cut secretly with Epstein`s lawyers.  That deal came just a few years after Epstein`s long time former pal Donald Trump told New York Magazine that Epstein was a \"terrific guy, adding he`s a lot of fun to be with.  It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do and many of them are on the younger side.\"\n\nAcosta defended his handling of the Epstein case on Wednesday blaming state prosecutors and insisting he cut the best deal possible but it wasn`t enough to save his job.  Sources tell NBC News that Trump spent yesterday asking friends and allies about whether Acosta should be fired, was assured that a cost it would leave on his own, which must have been a relief for president who pretty much never has the guts to fire anyone in person.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP:  I just want to let you know this is was him not me because I`m with him.  He was -- he`s a tremendous talent.  He`s a Hispanic man, he went to Harvard, a great student, and Alex I think you`ll agree.  I said you don`t have to do this.  He doesn`t have to do this.  You know what I know about Alex?  He was a great student at Harvard.  He`s Hispanic which I -- which I so admire.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES:  You did hear that last part right.  The President said he was a great student at Harvard.  He`s Hispanic which I so admire.  Acosta will be replaced by the latest acting member the Trump administration incoming Acting Labor Secretary Patrick Pizzella who used to work for disgraced Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff doing work that included and I quote here, pushing to prevent congressmen imposing minimum wage laws on the Northern Mariana Islands.\n\nAccording to the Leadership Conference on Civil Human Rights, the two men were lobbying for policies that essentially allowed for unchecked slave labor.  Yes, that`s right.  The new labor secretary was effectively a lobbyist for sweatshops.  So that`s who is going to be in charge of a department that is supposed to advocate for worker rights.\n\nI`m now joined now by Franklin Foer, National Correspond at the Atlantic who wrote about Pizzella`s lobbying way back in 2001, also with me former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.  Frank let`s I guess start on the Pizzella -- dig into the archives here of what he was involved in with Abramoff in the Mariana Islands.\n\nFRANKLIN FOER, NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, THE ATLANTIC:  So the Northern Mariana Islands are an archipelago in the Pacific Ocean.  They`ve been part of the Commonwealth of the United States since World War Two.  And they`ve existed in this weird Netherlands.  Since 1975 they`ve been allowed to ship goods to the mainland of the United States, duty-free, tariff-free, stamped with the made in the USA label.  But the Ford administration granted them an exemption for all labor laws.\n\nAnd so it became a magnet for foreign sweatshops where you had laborers coming from China and other places in Asia who would live in guarded barracks, they would be subjected to coerced abortions, they would be paid meager wages.  Their barracks were filled with rats and there were no -- there were very few toilets.\n\nAnd Pizzella lobbied to maintain the Mariana in this the state.  And he did so by essentially corrupting the conservative movement or taking conservatives, bringing them on junkets to the Hyatt at the Marianas.  They played golf, they would sip cocktails with umbrellas in them that go on tours of these factories and they`d come back and they`d write these articles about how the Mariana were a petri dish of capitalism, to use Tom DeLay`s words.\n\nAnd he successfully managed to stymie protection of these workers who were living in the most disgusting fetid conditions.\n\nHAYES:  This came up, Bob, during actually his confirmation hearing because he was -- he was a deputy and Al Franken, then in the Senate at that point pressed him on it.  Take a listen.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAL FRANKEN, FORMER SENATOR:  Did you and the so-called team Abramoff lobbyists lobby against the Murkowski legislation?\n\nPATRICK PIZZELLA, DEPUTY SECRETARY OF LABOR, UNITED STATES:  You know, we might have.  I don`t actually remember if we lobbied against that legislation, but I would assume we did.\n\nFRANKEN:  Would it bother you to know that you were lobbying against protections for thousand workers who are being abused?\n\nPIZZELLA:  Well --\n\nFRANKEN:  Would that bother you?\n\nPIZZELLA:  Of course it would.  But what you mentioned were allegations made.  I -- we were --\n\nFRANKEN:  Cases that were documented many times over and over again while you were lobbying against --\n\nPIZZELLA:  Increasing the minimum wage.\n\nFRANKEN:  Increasing the minimum wage.\n\nPIZZELLA:  Yes.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES:  Bob, what do you think?  Good call for Secretary of Labor?\n\nROBERT REICH, FORMER SECRETARY OF LABOR:  Well, you know, Chris, every time there is a new vacancy in the Trump administration, the next person who goes in is even worse than the one before.  I don`t know where the bottom is.  I mean, you`ve got -- you`ve got foxes guarding almost every henhouse across every agency in the federal bureaucracy right now, and this guy just seems even worse in many respects than Acosta.\n\nYou know the problem here really is systemic, and we`ve got to understand this as systemic.  You`ve got a cabinet of temp workers who don`t even understand their agencies and you`ve got foxes guarding every single henhouse.  The American public is really not being treated in a fairly and in a responsible way.\n\nHAYES:  Yes, Frank, I mean, I think there`s been 13 cabinet departures, at this point Obama had zeroed (INAUDIBLE) had one.  When you look at DHS, you see what this looks like.  You`ve got acting at CBP, you`ve got acting at the top of the agency, you`ve got acting at ICE.  Here are the actings just to the cabinet level.  Labor, Defense, Homeland Security, U.N. Ambassador.  You go down to FEMA Director as a storm bears down in New Orleans and you`ve got an acting.\n\nI mean, this is -- at some point this is going to bite very hard don`t you think?\n\nFOER:  It`s an astonishing list and it speaks to a lot of the incompetence that we see.  And I think one other vital point is that Acosta was criticized by some for not moving quickly enough to dismantle worker protections.  And we have to remember -- and Secretary Reich remembers this, knows this better than anyone.  He -- this is a department assigned to protect the American worker and the American workplace in the regulatory state that it presides over.  It has a real meaningful effect.\n\nAnd to bring a guy in whose idea of freedom is a sweatshop island, I mean it really does speak to their vision for the American worker.\n\nHAYES:  How much damage can be done, Bob, when you`ve got very loose supervision, no meaningful check because you don`t have advice and consent of the Senate in a lot of these places and someone motivated by a specific either corporate or ideological agenda.\n\nREICH:  Well, Chris, a great deal of damage can be done particularly because Trump likes to have acting directors and acting secretaries.  It gives him much more leeway.  He says it gives him more flexibility.  What it really means is there`s no accountability to the public, to the Congress.  There`s no vetting and the Labor Department I can tell you is a collection of very, very dedicated and capable public servants.\n\nBut to treat them the way that they have been treated is really -- well it`s not bringing out the best in the department.  Let`s put it that way.  And the public needs those labor protections.\n\nHAYES:  Franklin Foer and Robert Reich, thank you both for being with me.\n\nREICH:  Thank you.\n\nFOER:  Thanks.\n\nHAYES:  Next, Robert Mueller`s testimony before Congress are now officially delayed.  More on that breaking news next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHAYES:  We have more breaking news tonight.  House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry Nadler says former special counsel Robert Mueller has agreed to reschedule his testimony.  Mueller had been scheduled to testify this coming Wednesday, now he will testify a week later on July 24.  According to Nadler, Mueller has agreed to appear for an extended period of time in front of both the judiciary and intelligence committees\n\nJoining me now is Buzzfeed News legal reporter Zoe Tillman.  This seems like it was in the works.  What do we know about how this came about and what it means?\n\nZOE TILLMAN, BUZZFEED NEWS:  What we had been hearing earlier today and as the days  were getting closer to the much anticipated July 17 date was that the time restrictions were concerning to some of the more junior members of the committee, who were concerned that they would not have time to ask questions, that there wouldn`t be enough time for robust questioning of the former special counsel, and it look likes with the delay of a week and the extension of time, that that will allow more members to ask questions and will allow generally for a longer and in theory more comprehensive  hearing, although it`s not clear how much the special counsel is really willing to say, regardless of the length of time and how many people ask questions.\n\nHAYES:  So it`s a week later, but a longer period of time.\n\nThere was something else happening today on the sort of congressional oversight beat, which was an oral argument before the D.C. Circuit that was an appeal of a District Court finding that basically said a congressional subpoena of a  financial firm that worked with the president, Mazar`s, that the president had to turn over the documents.  They appealed to the D.C. Circuit today.  And there were oral arguments there  You got to listen to them.  What happened there?\n\nTILLMAN:  It was not another great day for the president`s attorney in these cases.  Right now they are challenging subpoenas to financial institutions, both here in court in Washington as well as in New York, and the president`s personal attorney faced a lot of skeptical questions about his argument that basically, the House Oversight Committee lacks any power to look into the president`s personal financial matters.\n\nThere were questions especially from Judge Patricia Millett basically saying are you arguing that congress can`t initiate an investigation into corruption by the office of the president?  And the president`s lawyer effectively said yes\n\nHAYES:  I want to play that sound with Judge Millett and William Consovoy who is representing the president.  Take a listen, because it is remarkable sound.  Take a listen.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nPATRICIA MILLETT, D.C. CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS:  Imagine you have in the future the most corrupt president known to humankind, open flaunting, doing it.  What law could congress pass?\n\nWILLIAM CONSOVOY, ATTORNEY FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I think it`s very difficult to think of one.\n\nMILLETT:  OK, you can`t think of one\n\nCONSOVOY:  I understand that sounds extreme, but I`d like to take a shot and explain why it`s not.  So just look at the presidential records act, that would be the most innocuous one, and it survived constitutional review.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES:  So he is basically arguing like they just don`t have the power as an almost constitutional matter to do this, right?\n\nTILLMAN:  That`s right.  And it`s really consistent with the arguments that we`ve seen coming from not just the president in his personal capacity, but also this administration basically saying there should be limits to what congress can demand of executive branch agencies.  There should be limits on what congress can demand of outside parties that are connected to the president.  We expect to see a similar argument raised in a lawsuit that Democrats have filed against the Treasury Department seeking the president`s tax returns, so the Justice Department effectively made the same arguments in a legal memorandum that we saw coming from the president`s personal attorney.\n\nSo they are launching a full out strategy of trying to limit court review of much as possible.\n\nHAYES:  Ah, this will be interesting, because this is almost certainly going to end up before the Supreme Court.  Zoe Tillman, thank you very much.\n\nTILLMAN:  Thanks.\n\nHAYES:  Next, after caving on putting a citizenship question in the census, President Trump says he didn`t back up.  I`m sorry, I screwed that up.  He didn`t back down, he backed up.\n\nBut conservatives are upset over this failure in their effort to maintain minority rule.  That`s next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP:  Not only didn`t I back down, I backed up.  Anybody else would have given this up a long time ago.  The problem is we had three very unfriendly courts.  They were judges that weren`t  exactly in love with this whole thing.  And they were wrong.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES:  The president for the second day in a row pretending he had not been dealt defeat in his quest to put a question about citizenship on the U.S. Census.  But it was a defeat.  And his allies in the conservative Federalist Society know it.  And Axios quoted one of those conservative leaders today calling the whole situation a total waste of everyone`s time that will give people pause the next time one has to decide how far to stick one neck`s out.\n\nOh, they`re sad.\n\nThe reason they`re ticked off, and the reason there was such strenuous effort put in to have the citizenship question put on the census in the first place is that this effort to get the question is part of a much broader GOP and conservative project that extends across the entire coalition from Trump to Mitch McConnell, to state legislators, to the Supreme Court.  And the project is to alter the structures of American governance and representation to protect minority rule for an increasingly outnumbered white Republican base.\n\nAnd the president`s failure on the census means he blew the whole thing, or at least part of it for everyone involved.\n\nJoining me now, Maya Wiley, former assistant United States attorney in the civil division and MSNBC analyst, and Will Wilkinson vice president of research at the Ninconin Center (ph), whose latest work deals with urbanization, polarization and the populist backlash.\n\nI knew I was going to screw that up, Will.\n\nHere is what`s remarkable to me, Maya, the Trump administration lied about what they were doing on the citizenship question.  They even acknowledged it so much because now when you ask them why they are doing it, they don`t go with the lie that it was the Voting Rights Act, they lied before the courts, they lied before congress, they lied before the American people.  They lied in representation to lower court judges about their motives, four justices on the Supreme Court, the four conservatives, including two appointed by Trump, said that`s fine.  Go ahead.  We want you to be able to lie about this, because basically, we support the project, right?\n\nMAYA WILEY, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. A TTORNEY:  Pretty much.  I mean, what they say is you can -- so the interesting thing about the opinion, and I think Linda Greenhouse wrote an excellent piece on this, you know, they spent 22 pages, including Chief Justice Roberts, 22 pages explaining you can do this\n\nHAYES:  Right.  You the power to do this.\n\nWILEY:  You have the power to do this.  Just go back, because you don`t even have to talk about those four dissenting justices, even Chief Justice Roberts, just go back and come up with something else.\n\nHAYES:  Right\n\nWILEY:  It`s essentially what he says. Even though -- because Elena Kagan in the argument says you want us to believe that after you came up with the reason, after making the decision you wanted the question, and then you started shopping around for the rationale.\n\nHAYES:  Right\n\nWILEY:  But we`re supposed to believe your rationale  And that did not sway the justices.  And it`s really interesting to think about how much the new evidence that was not before the Supreme Court that really an intentional decision to disenfranchise, essentially, large groups of people of color was really what was underneath it.\n\nHAYES:  Will, you just wrote this great report about the sort of urban rural divide to oversimplify American politics.  And you have this argument that basically Republican Party is becoming the party of what you call pastoralist supremacy.  What does that term mean?  And why is it so important for them to put structures in place that allow essentially minority rule?\n\nWILL WILKINSON, THE NEW YORK TIMES:  :  Well, in my paper, i explain that our politics has become split along population density.  And the Republican Party has become basically the party of white older lower density America and the Democratic Party is the multicultural party of the city.\n\nThe problem for Republicans is that their base is a minority of the overall population, and a  shrinking one.\n\nHAYES:  Right\n\nWILKINSON:  T hey could -- our system is already rigged to favor smaller populations and lower density states, but that`s not good enough given the size of that coalition.\n\nHAYES:  So what they need are means of electoral college and the U.S. senate which are baked into the U.S. constitution but also political gerrymandering.  This is another thing the court did uphold, right.  This all part of the same project.  It`s got the same people behind it.  These are the gerrymanders, this is the Wisconsin one, which was upheld by the Supreme Court.\n\nRoberts, right, he said, oh, you were too grievous in the way you lied I have to ding you on this, the Dems got 53 percent of the vote in Wisconsin and they got 36 percent of the state assembly seats.  The GOP won 45 percent of the vote, a minority, and got 64 percent, almost a super majority.\n\nIf you rig the game like that, you can get away with minority rule.\n\nWILEY:  This is exactly why after the Supreme Court said, you know, we`re gut -- even though majority of senators, bipartisan, have historically and continuously said there`s a need for the Voting Rights Act, that we have continuing discrimination, and there`s no way to protect voters of color after elections.  They`ve already lost their political voice, so we have a pre-clearence rule.  We say you have to -- those places that have a long history, including a recent history, still have to get permission to do something that might harm  voters of color.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court says, you know what, we`re just going to gut that now.  The flood gates open in states like Texas, North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, that continue a process of making it extremely difficult for strict voter ID laws, you know, ending early voting -- you know, in Georgia we saw disenfranchisement by purges and also by, you know, typos -- disenfranchisement by typo.\n\nSo, all of these -- and in some states, very explicit statements by Republican legislators, that this is to ensure political power.\n\nHAYES:  It does, Will, seem to me like we`re headed towards a real kind of Democratic crisis here, because your argument in that paper is that they have every incentive to create structures, either through the courts or through other means, to kind of barricade themselves of a degree of political power as their base shrinks.\n\nWILKENSON:  Yeah, I mean, it`s a -- it`s not necessary.  It`s a contingent thing.  The Republican Party, because they have the advantage of the low density, low population bias, could easily maintain its electoral edge every cycle without what I call the anti-majoritarian firewall.  They could keep winning elections if they just dig in one or two percentage points to the non-white vote share every election cycle, but they won`t do it because they have become invested in the idea that their base, as presently constituted, is the only true and legitimate manifestation of real American identity.\n\nSo, they have to hunker down into that identity.\n\nHAYES:  Will Wilkinson and Maya Wiley, thank you both for joining us.\n\nAhead, as Tropical Storm Barry closes in on New Orleans, the city faces an unprecedented set of dangers we`re going to go live from New Orleans, ahead.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nALVA JOHNSON, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISER:  And so he just starts getting closer and when I realize that he was going to kiss my lips, I turned my mouth and he caught me right in the corner of my mouth  And I was just kind of frozen.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES:  Back in February, I interviewed Alva Johnson, this is a woman who worked on the Trump campaign and then filed a lawsuit for unequal pay against the campaign, and for battery against President Trump,alleging that then candidate Trump had forcibly kissed her on the mouth in August of 2016.\n\nAt the time of her interview, she was the 15th woman to accuse the president of some kind of unwanted sexual contact.  And since her accusation, the writer, E. Jean Carroll, has alleged the president raped her violently 23 years ago in the Bergdorf Goodman changing room.\n\nWell, this week, a new development in the Johnson lawsuit.  The president`s defense team produced a video of the alleged incident taken by a Trump campaign volunteer.  Here it is.  The defense says this shows that Johnson`s characterization was wrong.  The allegation that he forcibly kissed her and kissed her on the mouth are entirely false.  The exchange was an innocent moment.\n\nJohnson`s lawyer said in a statement, the video, quote, corroborates exactly what Alva said.   Now whether or not everybody would have felt violated by that is an open question, but Alva was.\n\nYou can make a judgment here yourself from that video, which now everyone can see.\n\nThere will be further judgments on this very question from the court.\n\nAs to whether the president should some day have to answer for the multiple credible allegations of sexual misconduct, including the allegation of rape, well, you can be the judge of that as well.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHAYES:  The first major storm of the season is heading straight for the Louisiana coast.  And tonight, Tropical Storm Barry is expected to make landfall tomorrow morning as a category one hurricane, bringing with it a major threat of storm surge and flash flooding as well as just massive amounts of rain.  25 inches are forecast in some areas of the state, 10 to 15 inches in the city of New Orleans where the Mississippi River is already eight feet above normal levels\n\nThe river is rising faster than expected at this very hour, although forecasters are still projecting it will crest after the storm at about 19 feet, which is a key number because it`s just below the height of many of the levees currently protecting New Orleans.  The mayor is now calling for a voluntary evacuation for everyone outside of the city`s levees and asking residents planning to ride out the storm to shelter in place starting at 8:00 p.m. local time tonight.\n\nI want to bring in New Orleans city councilwoman Cindy Nguyen, who is joining us tonight from the Ninth Ward, which she represents, where she is sheltering from the weather in a grocery store.\n\nCouncilwoman, what is the latest there?  How does it look for the folks who live there are not going to be leaving the city?\n\nCITY NGUYEN, NEW ORLEAN CITY COUNCILWOMAN:  Good evening, Chris.  Well, it`s pretty calm right now.  We have a little bit of wind in the lower nine area.  And people are still kind of making sure they are taking care of their preparation for the storm.  But it looks like many people are staying.  I see a lot of cars on the median.  I still see some cars traveling on the street.\n\nBut we are very hopeful.  We are very blessed that we have a very robust team that the mayor has put together to ensure that all citizens, not just in district eight, but the entire city of New Orleans will prepare to weather out the storm.\n\nHAYES:  You`re in the lower ninth, and of course everyone remembers what happened during Hurricane Katrina in the lower ninth where levees did fail.  It`s a part of the city that`s particularly below sea level.  Are you confident that the adjustments, changes, increases in levee strength and height that happened since Katrina put you in a good position to be protected from this kind of event?\n\nNGYUEN:  I spoke to the Corps of Engineers at length yesterday as well as this morning.  They are confident in their levee protections.  And they are the experts.  And so I`m going to follow along with them.  I`m going to continue to pray to make sure that all the citizens, not just the L9 (ph), but in Venetian 9 (ph), (inaudible) and the entire city is going to be safe during the storm\n\nHAYES:  How have things changed over time, particularly as we have climate models suggesting we`re going to wetter weather, probably more intense storms, even if they come less often, in how you and city officials think about planning when something like this happens?\n\nNGUYEN:  I think mostly it`s about education, but making sure that we have been pushing a lot about cleaning out the Cash Basin (ph).  I know my colleague, Councilman Jay Bank, has been really pushing that.  His area got flooded on Wednesday heavily.  And I know he started a massive movement in making sure the Cash Basins (ph) are cleaned out and making sure that people are not leaving debris out on the curb-sides so that way all of the drainage area is able to drain out the water.  Because water has got to go somewhere.  And if our drainage system is clogged up, then it`s going to go somewhere.  And we definitely don`t want to go into anybody`s homes.  We want it to go into the drainage system where it`s going to go out to where it needs to go to.\n\nHAYES:  All right, do you have a place that -- are there places that people can go inside the city of New Orleans that they can`t get out?  Is the recommendation they shelter in place at this hour?\n\nNGUYEN:  Yes, yes.  Mayor Cantrell has opened up several shelters, one is the Rosenberg Recreational Center.  People can actually call 311 and there will be an arrangement for people to be sheltered there.\n\nHAYES:  You expressed confidence in the Army Corps.  Has the Army Corps won that confidence from the city in the last 13 years?\n\nNGUYEN:  I believe they are working on it and they have continued to monitor the levee system.  They have been at it, you know, since Wednesday, and even before that.  It`s not just because of the storm that they have been monitoring the levee system.\n\nI will be out here tomorrow with them to make sure that the levee is going to be good.  They have put and added sandbags to make sure the water doesn`t topple over.  They will feel very confident about the levee system, and our citizens is going to be safe.\n\nHAYES:  All right, Councilwoman Cindy Nguyen.  We`re all pulling for you.  Thank you for joining me.\n\nThat is ALL IN for this evening.  \"THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW\" starts right now.\n\nGood evening, Rachel.\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

The National Weather Service predicting the storm will make landfall over the central Louisiana coast early tomorrow morning as a CAT 1 hurricane.\n\nThey expect it to weaken as it moves inland, but rain is the biggest threat here. Forecasters say the slow moving storm will likely sit over that already water logged region for days. So once again, the country is praying for New Orleans and for competence in our nation`s disaster response if the worst comes to pass.\n\nThis is a developing situation. We do not know what the next 24 hours will bring, but MSNBC of course will be monitoring the storm all weekend. That does it for us for now though. We`ll see you again on Monday. Now it`s time for the \"LAST WORD\" where Ali Velshi is in for Lawrence tonight.\n\nGood evening.\n\nALI VELSHI, MSNBC HOST:  Good evening, Rachel. We`ll pick up a very busy Friday evening as you described the way they all are these days. Have yourself a great weekend.\n\nMADDOW:  Thanks, my friend.\n\nVELSHI:  I`m Ali Velshi in for Lawrence O`Donnell. Tonight, the stench was horrendous. That`s how one reporter covering Vice President Pence`s visit to a border patrol station described the conditions inside. Crowded cages, migrants who said they were hungry and couldn`t brush their teeth, many who had been there for more than a month.\n\nWe will bring you more of the stunning images from the border and President Trump versus Paul Ryan, the former House speaker comes out swinging saying this about Trump, \"He didn`t know anything about government. I wanted to scold him all of the time.\" And of course the president hit back.\n\nMore on those stories later, but first, sex offender Jeffrey Epstein continues to be a problem for President Trump, a problem that`s not going away simply because Trump`s labor secretary has resigned. The president, for years before he took office, said that he was friends with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nHe even said in a 2002 interview that Epstein was a terrific guy who is a lot of fun to be with. Last year when the \"Miami Herald\" released it`s big expose on the Epstein case, one Epstein victim said she was working at Trump`s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida when she was recruited to be a masseuse to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nAnd to complicate matters for Trump, the Epstein revelations keep coming. The \"Miami Herald\" reported last night that \"at least a dozen new victims have come forward to claim they were sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein following Epstein`s arrest Saturday in New Jersey.\n\nNow tonight, the \"New York Times\" is reporting that Epstein \"was accused of witness tampering on Friday by federal prosecutors who said he wired $350,000 to two people who were potential witnesses against him. Mr. Epstein sent the money to the potential witnesses in late November and early December 2018 shortly after the \"Miami Herald\" published an investigative report about a secret deal he had reached with authorities in Florida to avoid federal prosecution, prosecutors said.\n\nAnd there are more details from Epstein accuser, Jennifer Araoz, who said that Epstein raped her when she was 15 years old. She described her relationship with Epstein in an exclusive interview with NBC`s Savannah Guthrie.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nSAVANNAH GUTHRIE, NBC HOST:  Did you ever think why did this older man want to hang out with a 14-year-old?\n\nJENNIFER ARAOZ, EPSTEIN`S ACCUSER:  I did. I but I didn`t overanalyze it because I did and I didn`t care. It`s really big because I just knew that I was young. I, you know, needed the money. He was -- I thought maybe just he needed companionship. I wasn`t sure what it was. I really didn`t ask any questions.\n\nGUTHRIE:  So the first time you went there alone, is that when something sexual happened for the first time?\n\nARAOZ:  He brought me up to the upstairs room which had the massage room and he would tell me like I want to show you my favorite room in the house. I guess he was getting more comfortable and afterwards he basically said -- he transitioned into, you know, do you give good massages?\n\nGUTHRIE:  Promises to help her become a model or actress and help her family financially also kept her coming back, she says, even after he began sexually abusing her.\n\nARAOZ:  I wasn`t thinking this is belittling. I was just a lost kid, you know, so I just -- it just seemed, OK. I don`t know.\n\nGUTHRIE:  And he have suggested he might help you that was this promise hanging over all of that.\n\nARAOZ:  Yes. So I just -- I said this could only be beneficial, you know. This was a good thing. Just stick it through, you know. It will get easier it will get better so I just kept on going.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nVELSHI:  Jennifer Araoz is not involved in the new federal indictment against Epstein, but her lawyers have now asked a New York court for more information about Epstein and his associates in anticipation of filing a civil case against him.\n\nEpstein`s attorneys have previously questioned Araoz`s credibility, but through these most recent revelations, the president has tried to distance himself from Jeffrey Epstein, claiming that he had a falling out with Epstein more than a decade ago.\n\nBut here`s a thing to keep in mind, a point that Lawrence made at the beginning of the week. The president has yet to say a bad word about Jeffrey Epstein. He still hasn`t condemned Epstein`s criminal acts, but Trump apparently realizes how bad those criminal acts are and how bad they could be.\n\nCNN is reporting that privately, Trump was \"stewing\" over labor secretary Alex Acosta`s fate over his handling of Epstein`s 2008 case, fearing a steady stream of revelations. \"There would just continue to be disclosures, one official said. There would be questions in this town and on the trail\" meaning the campaign trail.\n\nAnd that brings us to the resignation of Alex Acosta, a man who just two days ago said he had no intention of stepping down and who is now resigning.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I just want to let you know, this was him not me because I`m with him. He was a -- he`s a tremendous talent. He`s a Hispanic man. He went to Harvard, a great student. And in so many ways, I just hate what he`s saying now because we are going to miss him.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nVELSHI:  Alex Acosta held a nearly hour long press conference earlier this week defending his role as a U.S. attorney in a lenient plea deal for Jeffrey Epstein. But his answers aren`t enough for congressional Democrats who are further complicating matters for Trump. House Democrats want Acosta to testify about his role in that plea deal and they also want a briefing from the Justice Department about the deal.\n\nLeading off our discussion tonight are Joyce Vance, former U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Alabama and Jennifer Rubin, opinion writer at \"The Washington Post.\" Both are MSNBC contributors. Thank you to both of you for joining us on a Friday night.\n\nJoyce, let`s start with you. There are inconsistencies in the argument that Alex Acosta put forward in his statement earlier this week, very different from his resignation, but he said things that others have come out and said simply aren`t true.\n\nThat victims had an opportunity to look at the sweetheart deal that he did or that they had other avenues that they could pursue. And there does seem to be evidence that he may have been in violation of rights that victims actually have under the law.\n\nJOYCE VANCE, MSNBC CONRIBUTOR:  You know, court has found that he did violate the victims` rights to be notified and it seems relatively clear that whatever they did in this case they made every effort to conceal it from victims, which is contrary to existing DOJ rules.\n\nThe suggestion that you can somehow avoid the obligation, you have to notify victims of the outcome of a case by not indicting it, is I think just very difficult to reconcile with the reasons that we have that policy in place.\n\nSo, everything that Acosta says in this regard contrary to the apology that he should have been making to these victims I think only dug him in deeper to problem.\n\nVELSHI:  That`s interesting because there are a lot of reasons, Jennifer, why cabinet secretaries come under fire in various scandals, but this one is pretty black and white. There is nobody in the country who thinks that the things Jeffrey Epstein did are tolerable on a societal level.\n\nHowever, when asked about this, the president said today that he was willing to live with anything and he didn`t ask for Acosta`s resignation. Let`s listen to what he said.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Do you believe, Mr. President, that Epstein has become and Mr. Acosta has become a distraction to the Labor Department?\n\nTRUMP:  Well, Alex believed that. I`m willing to live with anything, John. I think you know me. I`ve lived through things that you wouldn`t believe.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nVELSHI:  Jennifer, what do you make of the president`s handling of this?\n\nJENNIFER RUBIN, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, this is typical for Trump. He never expresses any sympathy, any empathy, any horror on behalf of the victims. He says that Alex Acosta was victim. He says that Alex Acosta was doing a great job.\n\nThat`s almost verbatim, the same language he used for Rob Porter for example, the former White House staff secretary who there was very convincing pictorial evidence, was a spousal abuser. This is how Trump operates. He thinks that in any of these cases, the man who was accused is the victim.\n\nAnd I would add just a couple of things. One, I think we shouldn`t ignore that very powerful interview at the top of your show with that girl who, still a girl in some ways, expressing I was just a kid. I didn`t know. If that doesn`t break your heart and explain the absolute mendacity, the malice, the evil that Jeffrey Epstein was encountering.\n\nAnd that in some sense, that Alex Acosta took advantage of that as well. They were just kids. They wouldn`t know. They would be so frozen out of the process. He would get this wrapped up and go on with his career. And the other thing is that he did lie. He specifically said that he had to be the one to swoop in to do this because the state was going to let him go.\n\nThe state prosecutor spoke up yesterday and said, you know, the feds always have the option to bring their own case. And by the way, there was a 53- page indictment. He could have pursued that. He could have investigated that.\n\nSo, I have, really, very little comprehension for someone like Alex Acosta can look himself in the face and -- look at himself in the mirror in the morning. And even less understanding for how Donald Trump who knew about this settlement when he hired him could have tolerated him this long.\n\nVELSHI:  This is an important point, Joyce that Jenifer makes. This is not -- this came up in Alex Acosta`s hearing. This was a known fact. All of the details about this were not known and the \"Miami Herald\" has done a remarkable job in reporting it.\n\nBut Alex Acosta definitely suggested in his press conference that if not for him, things could have been worse. He talked about the rolling of the dice of going to court, taking Jeffrey Epstein to court versus agreeing to this very lenient deal.\n\nWere you -- you are obviously a specialist at this having been a prosecutor. Were you able to make sense of what Alex Acosta was trying to get across and whether it made sense?\n\nVANCE:  It`s contrary to everything that I know about his office. For years I worked with the office he led. The Southern District of Florida based in Miami. You know, that`s an office that makes big drug cases and they make those cases by using witnesses who come with a lot of baggage, witnesses who had been deal drugs, who have engaged in all sorts of misconduct.\n\nSo the notion that somehow his office wouldn`t be able to convict in a case where dozens of victims had come forward because some of these girls were pictured on social media holding a beer. That just doesn`t make any sense. And no prosecutor views these sorts of sex abuse cases that way.\n\nThese are the cases where you charge hard because Jeffrey Epstein is a classic predator. And in that interview with Ms. Araoz, we hear everything that she is saying. He`s a dangerous predator. Alex Acosta`s obligation was to lock him up and get him off the streets so he couldn`t molest any other girls.\n\nVELSHI:  But this doesn`t end, Joyce. The \"New York Times\" is reporting that federal prosecutors want Jeffrey Epstein to be denied bail. The United States Attorney`s Office I Manhattan made the new witness tampering allegations that we heard about tonight in a court filing asking that Mr. Epstein be denied bail while he awaits trial saying the payments were evidence that he might try to influence witnesses if he were not detained.\n\nNow, we only have that reporting on this. Joyce, we don`t know what it is, but we do know that after the \"Miami Herald\" story came out in late 2018, prosecutors in New York are now saying that he wired $350,000 to two people who may have been witnesses in a new investigation.\n\nVANCE:  You know, prosecutors have two options when it comes to detaining a defendant pretrial. One is to argue that he`s a flight risk and we expected that with Acosta. I think the less expected piece is these alternative prosecutors have of arguing that a defendant is a danger to the community.\n\nAnd we saw that for instance in the Paul Manafort case with allegations that he was trying to witness tamper. This is that same thing. This is the allegation that if Acosta gets out of custody pretrial, he has shown a propensity to try to tamper with witnesses, to pay them off, to keep them from cooperating with law enforcement. And this was the sort of allegation that a judge should use to keep a witness locked up until he goes to trial.\n\nVELSHI:  Jennifer, while we are talking about people who have been -- who have left the Trump administration under scandal, there is another development -- Axios is reporting that President Trump has told confidants that he is eager to remove Dan Coates as the director of National Intelligence according to five sources who have discussed the matter directly with the president.\n\nAnd the president seems to be dissatisfied by Dan Coates, which isn`t -- doesn`t probably come as much of a surprise to you, Jennifer, because of those people who surround the president as part of the national intelligence and national security apparatus. Dan Coates is thought by some to be an old hand, somebody who has been in government in the past and who has publicly it appears, disagreed with the president`s assessments made by the intelligence community.\n\nRUBIN:  He is about the only one left in this administration who has a reputation with both Democrats and Republicans for being a professional, whose word is -- and can be taken seriously.\n\nWhat`s even worse about this report is there was a suggestion that John Bolton, about the most aggressive, the most partisan, the least calm individual one could ever imagine in government may be his replacement. And that is absolutely horrifying.\n\nVELSHI:  I want to ask you, Joyce, about the citizenship question. So much has happened this week it`s hard to keep track of it. The president was asked today about his comments yesterday in which he appeared to drop the efforts to get the citizenship question unto the census, but suggested that what he was doing now with an executive order was a change of course. Let`s listen to this conversation.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Did you back down on the issue?\n\nTRUMP:  No. No. Not only didn`t I back down, I backed up because anybody else would have given this up a long time ago. The problem is we had three very unfriendly courts. They were judges that weren`t exactly in love with this whole thing and they were wrong. But it would have taken a long time to get through those courts. You understand that better than anybody.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nVELSHI:  It`s an unusual statement, Joyce, not one that we are entirely unfamiliar with from this president, but we had three unfriendly courts. The judges weren`t in love with this whole thing. They were wrong. It would have taken a long time to get through the courts so I`m just going to handle it this way.\n\nVANCE:  Nobody likes losing in court, but that`s how our system works. When people have problems that they can`t resolve on their own, they go to court and we agree that when the highest court in the land speaks and decides a case, everyone lines up behind that decision, love it or hate it, and follows it. That`s everyone except for Donald Trump.\n\nAnd this suggestion that he`s made and one of the spokes people sort of embellished on it earlier today and said that he was tired of abiding by the courts and being controlled by them. Every single person in the Republican leadership on The Hill needs to be asked will you continue to support this president if he refuses to follow the law because that is by definition a constitutional crisis.\n\nWe averted it this week and whoever it was, I suspect folks in the Justice Department who talked the president down, he certainly did back down this week and agree to follow the court`s ruling. But with him, that will be a constant threat going forward, this risk that he will not abide the rule of law.\n\nVELSHI:  Joyce Vance and Jennifer Rubin, we so depend on you to provide the analysis that helps us understand these fast moving developments. Thanks to both of you.\n\nComing up, Republicans including Mike Pence went to the border today where they saw a severely crowded detention facility where nearly 400 men were being held in cages without cots to sleep on and where a reporter covering the vice president`s visit described the stench as horrendous, that`s next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nVELSHI:  Breaking news tonight on the humanitarian crisis at the southern border, disturbing new images capture the overcrowded conditions inside the Border Patrol station in McAllen, Texas where Vice President Mike Pence toured the facility today with a group of congressional Republicans.\n\nJosh Dawsey of the \"Washington Post\" who was the designated reporter traveling with the vice president wrote \"after negotiating with the V.P.`s office, pool was taken into an outdoor portal at the McAllen border station around 5:00 p.m. where almost 400 men were in caged fences with no cots.\n\nThe stench was horrendous. The cages were so crowded it would have been impossible for all the men to lie on the concrete. When the men saw the press arrive, they began shouting and wanted to tell us they have been in there for 40 days or longer. The men said they were hungry and wanted to brush their teeth. It was sweltering hot. Agents guarding the cages wearing face masks. Most of the men did not speak English and looked dirty.\"\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are not a terrorist. We are not a terrorist. We are not criminals.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nVELSHI:  Earlier in the day, the vice president applauded Customs and Border Protection \"providing humane and compassionate care after touring a different facility that Dawsey notes was new, clean, and relatively empty, filled with cots, medical supplies and snacks and where children were watching T.V.\"\n\nAfter seeing the overcrowd and unsanitary conditions at McAllen, Dawsey says he, \"Asked Pence afterwards if he was OK with what he had said. On the first two times, he didn`t directly say yes or no and said he expected to see it and wasn`t surprised. He later said he obviously wasn`t OK with it because he`d been trying to fix the system.\"\n\nAnd tonight, the vice president tweeted this response, \"The DHS facility in McAllen is a prime example of why we need to secure our borders. The facility is overcrowded and our system is overwhelmed. It is time for Democrats in Congress to step up, do their jobs and end this crisis.\"\n\nThese shocking pictures coming just hours after the House Oversight Committee held a hearing about the appalling conditions for migrant adults and children at the southern border that the Trump administration has tried to dismiss as unsubstantiated. Several Democrats who visited facilities in El Paso in Clint, Texas last week testified to what they saw including freshman Democratic congresswoman, alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY):  This is a manufactured crisis because the cruelty is manufactured. This is a manufactured crisis because there is no need for us to do this. There is no need for us to overcrowd and to detain and under-resource.\n\nThere is no need for us to arrest innocent people and treat them no differently than criminals when they are pursuing their basic human rights. These are the women that we spoke to. It`s their handwriting. And while we are being asked to speak only to officers, we are not getting the accounts of migrants, of their treatment, of what they are experiencing.\n\nAnd so when these women tell me that they were put into a cell and that their sink was not working and we tested the sink ourselves and the sink was not working and they were told to drink out of a toilet bowl, I believe them. I believe these women.\n\nI believed the canker sores that I saw in their mouths because they were only allowed to be fed un-nutritious food. I believe that when they said they were sleeping on concrete floors for two months I believe them.\n\nAnd what was worse about this, Mr. Chairman, was the fact that there were American flags hanging all over these facilities, that children being separated from their parents in front of an American flag, that women were being called these names under an American flag, we cannot allow for this.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nVELSHI:  We`ll discuss the humanitarian crisis at the southern border after the break with Angel Padilla and Danielle Moodie-Mills.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP:  Today in a few hours, Vice President Pence and the head of Homeland Security are taking the press and Congress people into detention centers and we are the ones who said they were crowded. They are crowded because we have a lot of people, but they`re in good shape.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nVELSHI:  They`re in good shape. That was President Trump this morning calling the border detention centers in good shape ahead of the Vice President`s visit to McAllen, Texas. But these stunning new images -- take a look at vice president. Look at his body language while this is all going on.\n\nThese were captured by reporters traveling with Pence revealing appalling conditions, which by the way, you`ve heard about several times from reporters, from lawyers, from members of Congress. But now the vice president is there with the cameras and you see men in cages, too many of them to lie down, crowded into cages having gone weeks without showers or being able to brush their teeth.\n\nJoining us now, Angel Padilla, the national policy director for the progressive activist group Indivisible, and Danielle Moodie-Mills, she is the host the terrifically named \"Woke AF\" on SiriusXM. Welcome to both of you.\n\nDanielle, what were we supposed to think was supposed to happen there? I mean, is the idea that because the vice president was going down there, that maybe they`d get some heads up and clean up the place because he is sitting there with his arms crossed, not really looking, making eye contact with anyone, watching what we have been hearing people come on this show and this channel over and over again and say is happening.\n\nDANIELLE MOODIE-MILLS, #WOKEAF HOST, SIRIUSXM :  He was supposed to go there and do the great razzle-dazzle, show the American people how clean, how safe, how sanitary these conditions were and how the people on the left like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were blowing everything out of proportion.\n\nVELSHI:  Right.\n\nMOODIE-MILLS: And in fact he shows up and what does he see? Everything that we`ve been told, just like you said, just like the reporting she had shown us, everything that we`ve known over the past several months that had been coming out of these camps, that they`re unsanitary, that they are unsafe.\n\nThat the smell, the stench that is coming out of these facilities, the scabies, the flu, all of the disease that is being created by this administration, right? When you can get up in court at the Ninth district federal court and say we don`t have to provide you with soap and toothbrushes and any diapers or anything, blankets, cots or anything like that, what do you think is going to happen?\n\nDo you think that everyone is going to end up being OK or do you think an outbreak is going to occur? And that more people are going to die. 24 adults have already died in U.S. custody. Six children have already died in U.S. custody because of their wilful neglect, because of a strategy that they have put in place that says that if we make it so uncomfortable, so detestable, so horrible--\n\nVELSHI: That they won`t come.\n\nMOODIE-MILLS: --then they won`t come.\n\nVELSHI: Yes, Angel, we listened to some of the testimony that Danielle was just talking about by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez just before this block. By the way, viewers may have noticed that at the end of her sentence they all looked over to the side because it did seem that somebody had taken ill, that was what that was about.\n\nBut to this last point angel Angel, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez mentioned that these are facilities in which the American flag is put up, over which the American flag flies. So the idea that these are detention centers and that they are unsavory and that they are unhealthy, there is really no reason for this to happen in 2019.\n\nIf you want to deter emigration, there are different manners in which you can deal with this. This does appear to be inhumane, this does appear to emulate some of the worst things that we`ve seen in history about the detention of people.\n\nANGEL PADILLA, NATIONAL POLICY DIRECTOR, INDIVISIBLE: Yes, that`s right. And people, there are thousands of people right now that are suffering at the border and you know, people are outraged as they should be you know, just today there were 800 events through the Lights for Liberty actions calling for the end of detention.\n\n800 events across five continents that`s how outraged people are and they should be but the two most important things that people need to know, anyone who`s outraged about what`s happening at the border, anyone who`s outrage about families being separated or the raids that might happen starting on Sunday, they need to know two things.\n\nNumber one, this is about choices, this is all because of deliberate choices made by this administration, it`s not about a lack of resources, it`s not about a lack of money, it`s because they are choosing to do this. Their purpose of doing this is to inflict as much harm and as much trauma on immigrant families as possible.\n\nIt`s about choices, that`s number one. Number two is that the U.S. Congress - the U.S. Congress pays for this. They are able to do this because Congress keeps giving this administration money and so one of the most important thing that anyone can do is make sure that their members of Congress know that they do not want their tax dollars going towards detention, going towards harming families.\n\nVELSHI: There`s a lot of money actually depending on how you look at it, if it`s the border patrol detention centers that are run by the government, it`s upwards of $200 a night and one would think, regular folks watching this understand what they can do with $200 a night, it doesn`t look like that and if it`s the private detention facilities, they`re upward of $700 a night which could probably get some of us a room at the Four Seasons,\n\nSo it`s a little puzzling as to why this is happening, why we are paying for this. However to Angel`s point, should we not be funding because there were a number of Democrats who voted against this funding bill, that finally did pass because the argument that Customs and Border patrol and DHS is making is that we don`t have the money for this.\n\nMOODIE-MILLS: But that is a lie, it is a lie and it`s one of the many lies that this administration has been telling us. This is not about funding because if it were about funding then Democrats women voted against the bill. The reason why the bill, Mitch McConnell`s bill was voted against because it didn`t have any guard rails to it, because they wanted provision specifically to make sure that there were going to be doctors, that there was going to be nurses, that the sanitary conditions that we need, that are required under law were actually going to be funded.\n\nThis was just money given to what? Trump`s wall, given to whatever and so no, this is not about money.\n\nVELSHI: Let`s listen to what - we saw Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, testifying next to her was Michigan Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib who toured border facilities her own self, last week. Let`s listen to what she had to say in today`s hearing.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREP. RASHIDA TLAIB (D-MI): I spoke to CPB agents even though they told us not to speak to them too. Remember that? And I said what do you think we need to do because you guys are overwhelmed. They said one of them, stop sending money, it`s not working. Another one said, I wasn`t trained for this, I am not a social worker.\n\nI am not a medical care worker. He actually said I want to be at the border, that`s what I was trained to be at. The separate - the one other one, the last one Mr. Chairman, the separation policy isn`t working he said.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nVELSHI: Angel, one of the tenets of our profession as journalists is to bear witness, to show people what`s really happening and that has succeeded. We have shown people what`s going on, we`ve had people at the border for over a year. There are lawyers and advocates and people like you who are showing them and now we have members of Congress.\n\nAnd then we even have the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security, everybody and today the Vice President confirms the same thing. What does it do? Where does it end? How does it change?\n\nPADILLA: Well, it`s - it`s super important. I mean look, what this administration does is operate in secrecy. They steal money from other agencies in order to and continue their enforcement practices. That`s why it`s so important to see things like that OIG report that you mentioned, shedding light into all of those abuses, all that mismanagement, all of the mistreatment that we`re seeing at the border.\n\nBut the bottom line is that this is - this is something that that we`ve known for a long time, this is nothing new. This is something that happened before Trump, it just has been accelerated and weaponized by this administration and the bottom line is that we`ve been investing in enforcement and have been separating families for a long time and it is time for us to stop doing that.\n\nThat`s why we`re part of the defund hate coalition. We`re taking - pressuring members of Congress to start defunding those hateful agencies because families have been separated at the border and internally.\n\nVELSHI: It`s remarkable in 2019, we`re separating parents from their children. Angel Padilla and Danielle Moodie-Mills, thank you both for joining us tonight. Coming up, Paul Ryan has left Washington but he`s back on Donald Trump`s mind today for what Ryan says about Trump in a new book. That`s next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nLAWRENCE O`DONNELL, MSNBC HOST: And so Paul Ryan will take his place in history as simply the worst of this country`s Speakers of the House of Representatives. And he has earned that position in history through unprecedented and unrelenting cowardice as Speaker of the House, an office that is constitutionally capable of containing and controlling an out of control President but Paul Ryan surrendered all of his powers to the Trump presidency.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nVELSHI: That was Lawrence`s assessment of House Speaker Paul Ryan`s tenure on the day that he announced, he would resign his speakership and now a new book from Politico`s Tim Alberta has confirmed what Lawrence and many others had assumed about Paul Ryan, that throughout the first two years of the Trump presidency, Paul Ryan disapproved of Trump`s behavior as President.\n\nBut was simply on willing to use his office to do anything about it. According to newly released excerpts from the forthcoming book `American Carnage,` Ryan left the Speakership because he could not stand the idea of another two years with President Trump. The young conservative crusader who once tried to raise the retirement age in America to 70 reportedly saw his own retirement at 48 as a \"escape patch.\"\n\nPresident Trump responded to reports of Ryan`s comments today both on Twitter and in a conversation with reporters on the White House - White House South lawn.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So Paul Ryan was not a talent. He wasn`t a leader. Paul Ryan was a lame duck for a long time as Speaker. He was unable to raise money. He lost control of the House. The only success Ryan had was the time that he was with me because we got taxes cut. I got regulation cut so I did that mostly without him.\n\nBut for Paul Ryan to be complaining is pretty amazing. I remember day in Wisconsin a state that I want where I stood up and made a speech and then I introduced him and they booed him off the stage, 10000 people.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nVELSHI: The only success Paul Ryan has was the time that he was with me. When we come back, I`ll talk to Charlie Sykes and Jennifer Rubin about Paul Ryan`s sudden change of heart when it comes to President Trump.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREPORTER: What`s your take on the President`s comments and if you`re--\n\nREP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI): I haven`t seen all of his comments.\n\nREPORTER: The President`s lawyer John Dowd has just resigned. Does that concern you?\n\nRYAN: Didn`t know anything about it. I don`t know the content of that conversation.\n\nREPORTER: Do you believe the President though when he says, do you believe the President?\n\nRYAN: I didn`t see his interview. I`ve been little busy today. I haven`t been looking at Twitter.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nVELSHI: That was how former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan used to respond to questions about Donald Trump but in a new book out next week, Ryan is finally letting the world know what he really thinks of the President. Joining me now is Charlie Sykes, Editor in Chief of the Bulwark and an MSNBC Political Analyst.\n\nJennifer Rubin is also back with us. Welcome to both of you, thank you for being here. Charlie, you know I`m a sort of wonky economics guy and when Paul Ryan showed up on the scene, I really - I used to like him, he always had a board like I do with numbers on and he tries to explain graphs and he gets to these wonky conversations and I thought that would sustain him.\n\nI thought that was the thing. He was going to be able to both intellectualize and deal with the economics of a conservative Congress. What went wrong?\n\nCHARLIE SYKES, EDITOR IN CHIEF, BULWARK & MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, pretty much everything. I mean Donald Trump rolled in and just crashed all of Paul Ryan`s vision of the party. I mean, when you think about it, you know, I mean, I`m old enough to remember when Paul Ryan was in fact the future of the Republican Party, when he was the intellectually and that was all cast aside.\n\nAnd the way you describe him is he really was the anti-Trump, he cared about policy, he cared about a lot of those things but when push came to shove, he made that Faustian bargain, that he was going to keep his mouth shut, he was going to keep his head down and he was going along with Donald Trump maybe because he was hoping that someday that Donald Trump would pivot or pay attention to this information.\n\nOr maybe he just simply thought that it was worth it to make that bargain in order to get the tax cuts but the reality is look, his legacy is badly tarnished and I will tell you this. I`m in Wisconsin right now. Trump was in Wisconsin today. Lot of the Republicans and elected officials in Wisconsin owe their political careers to Paul Ryan and worked with him for decades.\n\nNot one of them defended Paul Ryan today, not one of them pushed back against Donald Trump`s criticisms and that tells you what`s happened to the Republican Party and what`s happened to Paul Ryan.\n\nVELSHI: You are both conservatives, both of whom do not allow your reputation to be tarnished because - by making a Faustian bargain like Paul Ryan made. Jennifer, why is it so hard? Why is it so hard for conservatives like Paul Ryan and there are others like him who have read conservative work, who understand conservative economics and can get out there in the arena and make an argument in favor of it.\n\nWhy couldn`t they do that and push Trump aside?\n\nWell, they certainly could have done it t various junctures before he was elected. After he was elected, I think several things happened. One is just as Charlie said, they thought well, this guy isn`t so bad, we can get deregulation, we can get a bigger military budget, we can get tax reform.\n\nSo we just have to keep the bear from getting upset with us and therefore we`ll just ignore everything else and we`ll just be pleased with these little crumbs. Second thing is these people are scared of their own shadow, they live to be re-elected. You know Susan Collins is not exactly a conservative made a comment the other day that all around her Republicans in New England, they either retire or they die.\n\nAnd neither one of those options seem interesting to her. Does that speak volumes about what motivates these people? What? That they`re not going to have any life beyond the Senate, that we`d be willing to change your vote or to change your viewpoint in order to keep the same job year after year?\n\nThat unfortunately is the reality.\n\nVELSHI: Remember the day though, remember those days, Charlie? Remember after the recordings on the bus, I mean Paul Ryan felt and looked like a guy with a spine.\n\nSYKES: And he did and he did something extraordinary where he disinvited - he disinvited the President. I mean the nominee, from his own event and you know, Ryan Preibus, we got to get him off the ticket and they had the conference call with the House Republicans where he said I am done with him and that was a decisive moment.\n\nBut it wasn`t decisive in the way that I think a lot of us thought it would be and I think this is kind of the tragedy and a lot of people don`t like to hear that but the tragedy of Paul Ryan, look a lot of Republicans have caved in to Donald Trump, who you know, they compromise their values and their principles.\n\nBut what makes ran a little bit different is he knew better. He always knew who Donald Trump was. He knew what Donald Trump was all about. He was privately discussed that about it. He didn`t have a different opinion than I think than Jennifer and I had about Donald Trump.\n\nSo in a lot of ways his capitulation is the most disappointing and it`s the hardest to defend.\n\nVELSHI: Charlie Sykes, Jennifer Rubin, thank you again for joining me tonight. We`ll be right back with NBC`s Richard Engel who has important new reporting about what it looks like on the other side of Trump`s trade war with China.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nVELSHI: President Trump continues to repeat the lie that China is paying tariffs to help fund the $16 billion in aid that he`s designated for U.S. farmers.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: We are doing great with farmers now in a lot of ways. One way is we`re giving $16 billion out of all the tariffs that we`re collecting. We`re collecting you know, tens of billions of dollars of tariffs from China, they never paid a cent since--\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nVELSHI: No, no, we don`t collect tariffs from China. Countries don`t pay tariffs. Consumers who buy imported products pay tariffs. Only Americans pay the Trump tariffs imposed on China. NBC news Chief Foreign Correspondent, Richard Engel has traveled all across China, witnessing a country looking to make its mark as the 21st century super power.\n\nHere`s a look at Richard`s new report which examines how China is challenging the United States for global dominance in technology and trade.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRICHARD ENGEL, CHIEF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, NBC: To see what fuels that sense that China is on the rise, I`m heading to one of its most dynamic new cities. And I got to ride on China`s new high speed rail network. One of my fellow travelers happened to be a lawyer named Sandy Shang.\n\nSANDY SHANG, LAWYER FROM CHINA: We want our country to be the number one.\n\nENGEL: Number 1 country in the world?\n\nSHANG: Of course.\n\nENGEL: Leader of the world?\n\nSHANG: Of course, why not?\n\nENGEL: And what happens to the U.S.?\n\nSHANG: Number 2.\n\nENGEL: Number 2?\n\nSHANG: Why not?\n\nENGEL: No one champions that message more than President Xi Jinping. President Xi mixes Chinese nationalism with state controlled capitalism. The combination allows him to roll out huge projects very quickly. And none is bigger than the so called Belton road initiative. It`s a massive infrastructure project that spans multiple continents.\n\nYou might call it a Silk Road of the 21st century.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The United States clearly needs to keep an eye on the Belton road. I think there are geopolitical motivations, there are economic motivations, there maybe military motivations that`s entirely legitimate concern out there.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nVELSHI: Joining me now, good treat, is NBC news Chief Foreign Correspondent, Richard Engel. Richard, when you go to Africa and you need to talk about infrastructure and development, they`re talking about China. When you go to Eastern Europe and you talk about infrastructure and development, they`re talking about China.\n\nWhen you go anywhere and you talk about 5G, they`re talking about China. We are obsessed with China and trade or at least the President the United States is. China`s got a - they`re playing a bigger game than we are.\n\nENGEL: I think a lot of people would say that President Trump is focused in the - in the smallest of terms and in the shortest of possible timeframes. He wants to get a better deal and get the Chinese to buy some more agricultural product.\n\nVELSHI: Which is not a bad goal.\n\nENGEL: Which is not a bad goal but China thinks we`re looking to dominate the future and they are working to develop these massive infrastructure projects. So the Belton road initiative which we just talked about, not a very original name but a very important project.\n\nIt is setting up infrastructure projects all over the world. Roads, bridges, ports, commercial terminals not inside China but in all the countries that China wants to trade with.\n\nVELSHI: China is paying for people`s infrastructure in order to get access to their goods and their markets.\n\nENGEL: And to bring them back to Beijing. Remember the old expression? All roads lead to Rome?\n\nVELSHI: Right.\n\nENGEL: Now it`s all roads are going to lead to Beijing.\n\nVELSHI: So there are a lot of ways to think about them, if you were on a train, you can get from Beijing to Shanghai in about four hours on a high speed train, that`s the distance between New York and Chicago or New York and Atlanta. You can barely get between those places by the plane.\n\nENGEL: Nice train by the way.\n\nVELSHI: Yes.\n\nENGEL: Push a button, you go flat. You can move through aisle.\n\nVELSHI: And that is just for getting jostled around. That`s just an accessible version of infrastructure. They are - they see themselves as the builders of the world.\n\nENGEL: Not only are they building, these projects these infrastructure projects. The way they are set up is they are generally loaning the money to these countries to build the project with ferocious terms, should they default so pick a country in - an African country or a country in Southeast Asia.\n\nSure, the Chinese will come in, they`ll build the roads, they`ll build the commercial port but should they not pay it back, they basically have to seize an enormous amount of rights and responsibilities back to China. So some people say that China is building an empire, it is laying the foundation for a new Silk Road.\n\nChina has support to do this, other empires, other countries have done this including China in its own past.\n\nVELSHI: Right.\n\nENGEL: So the question is, is President Trump right to focus on agricultural goods and focus on trade while this larger - all this larger rivalries--\n\nVELSHI: I got 30 seconds. Is China able to wait out America`s political ambitions in terms of trying to get this deal through because they don`t actually face elections the same way we do?\n\nENGEL: Yes, in the 30 second answer, they can and they are counting on it. They see right now this moment as a strategic opportunity while the U.S. is divided, its attention is focused elsewhere, it has been proven that you can manipulate the political system from the outside.\n\nThey do see this as an opportunity for China not to just attain global pole position but to reattain what China sees as its natural historic place.\n\nVELSHI:  I`m looking forward to seeing the whole thing.  Richard, good to see you as always.  Thank you for joining me.\n\nYou can watch Richard`s full report on assignment \"On Assignment, Made in China\" Sunday 10:00 p.m. Eastern right here on MSNBC.  \"THE 11TH HOUR\" with Brian Williams starts now.\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

Let`s play HARDBALL.\n\nGood evening.  I`m Steve Kornacki in for Chris Matthews.  We have breaking news tonight in the Jeffrey Epstein case involving possible efforts of witness tampering.\n\nAnd another major shake-up in the Trump White House, Alex Acosta is out as Trump`s Labor Secretary amid unrelenting criticism that the former federal prosecutor helped to cut a lenient plea deal in that sex crime case against Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nTonight in a new court filing though, this is the breaking news, federal prosecutors are now accusing Jeffrey Epstein, who was arrested for allegedly trafficking underage girls, they are accusing him now of witness tampering.\n\nProsecutors say that Epstein wired $350,000 to two of his possible co- conspirators just days after the Miami Herald began publishing a series of articles about Epstein`s conduct and the circumstances surrounding that lenient non-prosecution agreement he cut with federal prosecutors.\n\nProsecutors write this, quote, Epstein`s efforts to influence witnesses continue to this day.  As in the past, within recent months, he paid significant amounts of money to influence individuals who were close to him during the time period charged in this case and who might be witnesses against him at a trial.\n\nGovernment lawyers obtained bank documents showing that Epstein wired one $1,000 to one individual two days after that Miami Herald story.  And three days later, Epstein wired another $250,000 to another alleged co- conspirator.\n\nProsecutors wrote, quote, this course of action and in particular its timing suggests the defendant was attempting to further influence co- conspirators who might provide information against him.\n\nRevelation comes a day after Epstein`s lawyers argue that Epstein was entitled to bail and request that he be released into home detention.\n\nFor more I am joined by NBC Correspondent Tom Winter.  Tom, I know you have been working the phones and trying to figure out exactly what`s going on here.  Take us through these two possible co-conspirators within days of the Miami Herald writing this story that kicked all of this back into the news in the last year or so.  They`re saying prosecutors that Epstein swung into action and cut some big checks.\n\nTOM WINTER, MSNBC CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  I mean, what`s important about this, how do we know that they`re possible co-conspirators.  Well, they`re identified in the filing tonight, and they`ve been identified previously as being in the non-prosecution agreement that Jeffrey Epstein was able to get as a result of Alex Acosta.  He authorized that non-prosecution agreement.  The two possible co-conspirators were identified in there.\n\nAnd then, apparently, between the two of them, within five days of that Miami Herald -- the series of Miami Herald articles coming out, they received $350,000.  One received a $100,000 payment.  The other got a $250,000 payment.\n\nAnd what`s interesting to me is that, within the filing tonight, prosecutors specifically talk about how that these were kind of one-off payments that did not occur at another time.  So they say neither of these payments appears to be recurring or repeating during the approximately five years of bank records presently available to the government, that being the federal prosecutors.  It tells me that they likely have suspicious activity reports from Treasury identifying these payments, or at the very least the bank flagged these payments.\n\nAnd it`s just indicative of an overall trend they say that goes back to when this case was first prosecuted or first investigated by the Palm Beach Police Department that noticed several attempts to perhaps intimidate or coerce victims.  They talk about payments back then.  And then you have more recent activity.  And here`s why it`s most important.  This is in response to Epstein`s efforts or his attorney`s efforts to get him a bail package.\n\nNow, prosecutors are saying, whoa, the bad activity that we`ve highlighted, the things that we`ve charged, the things we are investigating back in `05, `06, `07 and `08, that activity has not stopped.  We`ve got suspicious activity that`s occurring with his possible co-conspirators within the last six, seven months.  So this is going to be very damning when it`s presented and was filed with the judge when it`s talked about at the bail hearing on Monday.\n\nKORNACKI:  So we`re talking hundreds of thousands of dollars here coming from Jeffrey Epstein.  And we are also getting a better picture, a clearer picture of what he has financially.  What do you know now?  Hundreds of millions of dollars we`re talking about in terms of net worth, hundreds of millions potentially at his disposal.\n\nWINTER:  Exactly right.  So prosecutors tonight also say that, according to records from an institution, a banking institution, that they`ve obtained, he has at least $500 million of assets and cash available to him on hand.\n\nIn addition, they say that he has made $10 million just in that specific institution on an annual basis, and that`s the money he has coming in, that`s income that he has coming in.\n\nSo his income that`s supplanting the money that he is spending on the private jets, on the money that he is spending to keep up his mansion here in New York, the $77 million mansion, his property in Florida, his island in the U.S. Virgin Islands and to fly those planes.  So prosecutors are saying, look, it`s not just that he has money, he also has money coming in.\n\nAnd this is the first time we`ve seen a real detailed accounting of exactly how much money Jeffrey Epstein might have.  And it`s worth noting, it`s only from one institution.  It`s likely he has other institutions that he has done banking with.\n\nWe don`t know about offshore accounts.  Obviously, he`s got the -- in the U.S. Virgin Islands, whether or not he has other accounts.  And this raises questions about exactly how much --\n\nKORNACKI:  That money is a floor maybe, not necessarily the ceiling.\n\nWINTER:  Perfectly put.\n\nKORNACKI:  Could be more here.  Okay, Tom Winter, thank you, great reporting there.  I appreciate that.\n\nAnd meanwhile, the other big news in Washington today, Alex Acosta, Donald Trump`s embattled Labor Secretary, has now resigned.  Acosta joined the President who teed up the announcement while on his way to Marine One earlier today.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENT:  I just want to let you know, this was him, not me because I`m with him.  He was a -- he is a tremendous talent.  He is a Hispanic man.  He went to Harvard, a great student.  And in so many ways I just hate what he`s saying now because we`re going to miss him.\n\nALEXANDER ACOSTA, U.S.SECRETARY OF LABOR:  I do not think it is right and fair for this administration`s Labor Department to have Epstein as the focus rather than the incredible economy that we have today.\n\nAnd so I called the President this morning.  I told him that I thought the right thing was to step aside.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nKORNACKI:  And just two days ago, Acosta had tried to shore up his standing with the President by holding an hour-long news conference, but apparently it did little to quell the public criticism.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREPORTER:  Why is there no need for him to resign?\n\nTRUMP:  There is no need at all, as far as I`m concerned.  I would have -- I watched Alex yesterday.  I thought Alex did a great job.  And, you know, you can always second guess people and you could say it should have been tougher.  They do it with me all the time.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nKORNACKI:  And NBC News is reporting that the President sought input from friends and allies on whether or not Acosta should be fired or if he could weather the storm.\n\nFor more, I`m joined by Yamiche Alcindor, White House Correspondent at PBS NewsHour, Danielle Moodie-Mills, Sirius XM host, and John Podhoretz, Editor at Commentary Magazine.\n\nYamiche, let me start with you.  The President said of his soon to be former Labor Secretary, it was him, not me.  You heard him in the clip there saying, in my mind, he did not have to resign.  Of course, the President could have refused the resignation, I suppose.  Behind the scenes, take us there behind the scenes.  Was a message delivered to Acosta from somebody close to the President, somebody inside the administration that it was time to offer a resignation?\n\nYAMICHE ALCINDOR, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, PBS NEWSHOUR:  Well, this was really an incredibly moment and an incredibly awkward moment at the end of an incredibly awkward week for Secretary Acosta.\n\nThe President pushed Acosta, and sources tell me he encouraged him to go before the cameras, to make a public case to try to defend himself to keep his job.  It was essentially a tryout to say, if you can go before the cameras and I like what I`ll see, I`ll keep you, sort of like The Apprentice.\n\nInstead, the President looked at that, he didn`t watch it live.  But then after a few days, he was watching it, talking to people and decided, essentially, Acosta didn`t do a great job.  As a result, the President essentially walked him out there and really was this was in some ways a walk of shame for the Secretary of Labor.\n\nAnd what we saw was the President, while he was praising him, essentially saying, this guy is going to be leaving.  He has to go.  And they`re trying to say, and White House sources have been telling me, this was all about Acosta.  It was completely his idea.  But, essentially, the President said, yes, I agree with you, you should resign.\n\nAnd this is really the President trying to put space between him and Jeffrey Epstein.  But, of course, as Tom said, there are these new charges about Epstein witness tampering.  There are probably going to be more charges coming.  And President Trump was a very close friend of Epstein.  So even with Acosta out, this is going to be something that President Trump is going to continue to be asked about.\n\nKORNACKI:  John, that seems to be the key here.  The President, if you accept their version of events here, and Acosta got the idea himself, called up the President and said, I want to resign, the President could have said, no, you don`t need to, I refuse the resignation.  I want you to stay on.  So at the very least, he didn`t put up much of a fight here, apparently.  Is that an indication that from Trump`s standpoint, politically, there was no tenable way to go forward with Acosta in that position?\n\nJOHN PODHORETZ, EDITOR, COMMENTARY MAGAZINE:  I mean, it would have been stupid for him to argue that Acosta should stay, like the obviously clean break is a way to distance himself from the story and to make sure the administration isn`t asked daily about why isn`t Acosta resigning yet.\n\nKORNACKI:  But is there anything Acosta realistically could have said or done in that press conference just given the realities of this situation that might have changed what you`re describing?\n\nPODHORETZ:  Once the Miami Herald published the story about the deal that Acosta struck with Epstein in 2008, any resurfacing of the story in which the story became active, which is what happened this week when the Southern District of New York indicted him, was going to mean that Acosta had to go.\n\nI mean, there is no -- he gave a credible summary of his case the other day at his press conference that, you know, he was trying to make sure that Epstein didn`t get off scot-free.  It didn`t strike a lot of people as all that credible, but it was the best possible argument he could make, and I didn`t resolve anything.\n\nKORNACKI:  So, Danielle, just in terms of the politics of this, if the move, politically, from the President`s vantage point was to try to create some distance here as this Acosta -- excuse me, as this Epstein story plays out, did he achieve that?  Does getting rid of -- does having Acosta exit the administration create any new space?\n\nDANIELLE MOODIE-MILLS, SIRIUS XM HOST:  No, there is no space to be created.  And then the President tried to do that when he said, I haven`t spoken to Jeffrey Epstein in 15 years.  We had a falling out.\n\nBut the reality is that, look, Epstein is doing exactly what the President did before he became President of the United States, tampering with witness, paying them off.  Does that sound familiar?  It`s out of the Trump playbook.  And so the more that we dig into this sex trafficking, this child abuse scandal, the more that we`re going to recognize how many more recognizable names are involved in this.\n\nHe did not start this ring just for himself, right?  There are many other men that participated in this.  And the idea that the President of the United States in the 1990s was at a party, just him and Jeffrey Epstein and about a dozen women, some of whom, I`m sure, were underage is really problematic.\n\nSo I don`t think there is any room that is going to be made between him, between Epstein and the President of the United States just because the Secretary of Labor resigns.\n\nAnd more than that, this comes a couple of weeks after E. Jean Carroll`s bombshell report on the President.  So it`s one sex scandal after another.  I don`t think this goes anywhere any time soon.\n\nPODHORETZ:  I have to disagree with you, not because I want to defend Trump`s behavior in any way, shape or form, but we know in 2016, the entire country heard the Access Hollywood tape, and he got elected president a month after or four weeks after.\n\nSo the idea that more sex scandals are going to level him unless there is some credible case to be made that we don`t know of that he participated in something really horrendous with an underage person, this is now all been filed.  This is -- I wish it weren`t the case, but it is.\n\nMOODIE-MILLS:  Right.  And I think that the reality is that this isn`t just another sex scandal.  This is actually involving children between the ages of 13 and 16, and I think that we do -- I think that we do it a disservice to say.  These are the people -- remember growing up and your parents used to say, be careful who you hang around.  When you lay down with dogs, you get up with fleas.  The President right now is in need of serious ointment.  Everybody that is around him has been involved in some way, in some hideous scenarios, whether it is domestic violence and now it`s child abuse and sex trafficking.\n\nPODHORETZ:  Everyone?  You can`t say everyone around him.  I mean, not everyone.\n\nMOODIE-MILLS:  Enough people for it to be a consistent story.\n\nPODHORETZ:  Sex scandals and pedophilic or ephebophilic sex scandals are two different things.  They are not a continuum.  People who are interested in that kind of horrendous behavior have a separate etiology and a methodology.  And until we have any reason to believe that that is a taste of Trump`s, you are stretching the boundaries of what is acceptable.\n\nKORNACKI:  I think if we can reset it though to where we started here, just on the basic question here, from the administration`s standpoint, trying to change the subject, trying to create some distance here, I think there is that open question, politically, that the 2016 campaign has put out there on this issue and on so many other issues.  How much was out there in the 2016 campaign that would have killed off politically any other candidate?  And Donald Trump -- it raises the question where the divisions that were sort of set in place in that 2016 campaign locked in place.  Did they live with us throughout this presidency?  That`s one of the questions the next election is going to tell us.\n\nBut also, there is Epstein`s arrest.  It has renewed focus on his relationship with President Trump.  As we`re talking about here, some context to The New York Times, the two had a years` long friendship with Trump famously telling the New York Magazine that Epstein was a terrific guy at one point.  The President says that years later, they did have that falling out.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREPORTER:  Why did you have a falling out with Jeffrey Epstein and did you ban him from Mar-a-Lago?\n\nTRUMP:  Yes, and I did have a falling out a long time ago.  The reason doesn`t make any difference, frankly.  But I haven`t spoken to him in probably 15 years or more.  I didn`t want anything to do with him.  That was many, many years ago.  It shows you one thing, that I have good taste.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nKORNACKI:  Yamiche, let me bring you back in there.  Just in terms of your reporting, what you`re hearing at the White House, what do they tell you about that Trump-Epstein relationship?  What do they tell you about their expectations as the legal drama with Epstein now plays out?\n\nALCINDOR:  I should say, White House aides really have been very reluctant to talk about this story and talk about the President`s relationship with Epstein.  What we do know is that there is obviously this public information which is that, at one point, President Trump was saying that Jeffrey Epstein was a good guy.  He did like women on the younger ages, but that he -- but that they were close friends.\n\nNow, you see the President is saying that there was some sort of falling out, but he wouldn`t go into detail, and I think those details might be critical.  It`s really critical to find out what did President Trump actually know.  If, in fact, he is in some way -- we come to find out that he knew a little bit more about what Jeffrey Epstein was up to, he maybe knew the ages of these women and didn`t alert authorities, that might be politically and criminally damaging to the President.\n\nBut I will say also that I`ve talked to a lot of Trump supporters, and a lot of women Trump supporters.  The one thing that they seem to always have a soft spot for is children and this idea that even immigrant children who are being separated from their families, when you have people that have hard line immigration stances, when they think about children being mistreated, they start to question the President.  So I think when we start seeing here whether or not the President knew about whether or not 14-year- old children were being abused by Jeffrey Epstein, that might open up into a different kind of problem that President Trump hasn`t quite had to deal with in the past.\n\nKORNACKI:  And just to be clear, and I think I heard you say it, but just to make sure I heard you correctly, you`re saying in terms of talking to folks at the White House, they`re just not giving you any indication of what this falling was about?\n\nALCINDOR:  Exactly.  They`re not -- they`re not at all saying anything about what this falling out was about.  The President obviously was troubled enough that he banned him from Mar-a-Lago and told him that he didn`t want to be around him after years of hanging out with him.  So we just have to figure out what those details are and why they actually fell out.\n\nBut it obviously had to be something very serious for him to go from hanging out with him and having private parties with him to banning him from his private golf course.\n\nKORNACKI:  All right.  Yamiche Alcindor, Danielle Moodie-Mills, John Podhoretz, thank you all for being with us.\n\nAnd coming up, Robert Mueller`s congressional testimony is scheduled for next Wednesday.  Well, now, suddenly, it might not happen, at least not next week.  We will tell you what the holdup may be all about.\n\nAnd brand new poll numbers from the key early primary State of South Carolina.  We showed you the national numbers yesterday.  Now, we`re showing you the first big state with a large African-American voting bloc, new numbers to tell you about there.\n\nPlus, presidential retreat, Trump backing down on the census, part of a growing pattern of bold talk followed by little or no action.  Here is something you don`t see every day.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP:  And I`ll tell you something about Nancy Pelosi, that you know better than I do, she is not a racist, okay?  She is not a racist.  For them to call her a racist is a disgrace.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nKORNACKI:  There is the President defending the Democratic Speaker of the House while also trashing her republican predecessor.  Much more ahead.  Stay with us.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nKORNACKI:  Welcome back to HARDBALL.\n\nDespite Robert Mueller`s agreement over three weeks ago to testify before the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, the date of his testimony is now up in the air.\n\nNBC News is reporting that the Mueller hearings that were slated for next Wednesday may now be delayed until July 24, though the negotiations remain fluid.\n\nAccording to Politico, lawmakers have been seeking -- quote -- \"more time to question the former special counsel.\"  Yet the possible new date is just one day before lawmakers are scheduled to depart for a month-long summer recess, leaving little time for impeachment advocates to seize on my momentum.\n\n\"The Washington Post\" is also reporting late tonight that it was Mueller who proposed the new date to give lawmakers more time.\n\nThe latest ABC News/\"Washington Post\" poll shows that 59 percent of Americans now say that Congress should not begin impeachment proceedings.  Only 37 percent say they should.\n\nAll of this comes after the House Judiciary Committee authorized 12 new subpoenas yesterday for big-name witnesses, including Jared Kushner, Michael Flynn, and Jeff Sessions.  However, the administration has already proven they will block or limit witness testimony at many turns.\n\nI`m joined now by a member of one of the committees that was scheduled, may still be scheduled to interview the former special counsel, Congress Steve Cohen of Tennessee, a member of the Judiciary Committee.\n\nAnd Caroline Fredrickson is president of the American Constitution Society for Law and Policy and the author of \"The Democracy Fix.\"  Caroline testified today before the House Judiciary Committee in a hearing about addressing presidential misconduct.\n\nThank you both for joining us.\n\nCongressman, let me start with you.\n\nAnd let me just see if we can get some news out of you.  When is Robert Mueller going to testify before your committee?\n\nREP. STEVE COHEN (D-TN):  Well, that`s still being negotiated by the committee and committee counsel.  So we don`t really know.\n\nBut I suspect he will testify on I would guess the 24th, but that`s all up in the air.\n\nKORNACKI:  Is this reporting from \"The Washington Post\" correct that it was Mueller who came to the committee and said, perhaps a delay would be in order here?  He was the one who suggested this?\n\nCOHEN:  I don`t know that for a fact.  I just know that they had negotiations, and part of it was to have more time for the Judiciary Committee, so that we could operate as we normally do, with every member having an opportunity to participate in questions, which the Republicans, as well as the Democrats, sought.\n\nAnd I think that was fair.  Originally, it was based on the Intelligence Committee wanting two hours, which covered five minutes for all of their members, but didn`t take into consideration the Judiciary, and it might have just fallen through the cracks.\n\nKORNACKI:  Right.  So, originally, this looked like it would be two hours for each committee.  That would be for next week, if it goes as schedule.\n\nIf it goes, say, a week later, so how much time would you have?\n\nCOHEN:  I don`t know.  That`s being negotiated.  I would hope it would be enough, at least three hours, maybe four.  But it`s up to Mr. Mueller and his folks and the committee.\n\nKORNACKI:  OK.\n\nCaroline Fredrickson, let me ask you about just the expectations for this.  And I`m curious, because we have seen and we have heard from Robert Mueller in public for the past two-and-a-half years basically at that press conference, now a couple of months ago.\n\nI say press conference.  He didn`t take questions.  He talked for about 10 minutes.  I think the impression he left on everybody, measured, very precise in what he was willing to say and what he was not willing to say.\n\nWhether it`s two hours in front of these committees, or whether it`s a more expansive questioning, is there any reason to believe he is going to be any more expansive in what he is willing to say publicly?\n\nCAROLINE FREDRICKSON, AMERICAN CONSTITUTION SOCIETY:  Well, I doubt that very much.\n\nBut there are -- simply reading from his own report in his own voice, I think, would be incredibly forceful for the American public.\n\nAnd we all have to be honest.  Few people have read the report.  Not very many people even have read the summaries that were released.\n\nBut there is incredible content in there, very disturbing findings about misconduct by the president and by his campaign and his associates that having Mr. Mueller, with the reputation that he has, with his measured delivery, with his history of public service, his military service, just telling people what happened, I think will have an enormous impact on how people -- how much people understand about what has really occurred.\n\nKORNACKI:  Congressman, let me ask you about that, because we put the poll number up there.  This was from a couple of days ago, the ABC/\"Washington Post poll; 37 percent say impeachment, go ahead; 59 percent of Americans say, no, don`t do impeachment.\n\nIf you have Mueller, if you hear from Robert Mueller, and those numbers don`t change, is that the end of it in terms of the push for impeachment?\n\nCOHEN:  No, not at all.\n\nYou know, when they started looking at Nixon, it was about 19 percent were for impeachment.  Mueller will be very important in his words and to affirm and to remind the American people that what was in that report is that there were over 100 contacts with the Russians, and the Trump campaign did not refuse them.  They sought them.\n\nThey called for them, and that there were many instances of obstruction of justice, and that Mueller could not say the president didn`t violate the law.  And he said the only reason he didn`t indict him -- or one of the reasons, if it`s the only reason, was because of the Office of Legal Counsel`s determination that they couldn`t legally indict a president.\n\nOtherwise, he would have been indicted, and he would have been like Individual 1 in New York and been with Michael Cohen up the river in New York.\n\nWe need the direct evidence, the people we have subpoenaed, the folks that paid off Stormy Daniels and helped do that and bought the story of Ms. August, the people who were asked to get Mueller to resign, to ask Sessions to unrecuse himself, to ask McGahn to put out a false paper trail and to lie about the president, asking him to fire Mueller.\n\nThose are obstruction of justice charges.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKORNACKI:  Congressman, I think what I`m getting at is this, though.  Between the polling we put up at 37-59 -- and I hear the case you`re making right there.  I have heard you and I have heard other Democrats make that case.\n\nHere we sit, now well into July, and those are the numbers on impeachment.  You have got Mueller potentially appearing.  Let`s say maybe it`s the 24th.  As soon as he finishes, then Congress is supposed to go on a recess basically until the end of the summer.\n\nSo you`re laying out all these other things you need.  Between the poll numbers that show the public is not there right now, that looming recess that is going take you to Labor Day, going to take you into September, is the clock just running out here for folks like you who want...\n\nFREDRICKSON:  Steve, it possible for me to jump in here?\n\nBecause I think we`re sort of missing the bigger picture.  Impeachment is obviously something that Congress could be considering, but there is so much more at stake.\n\nAnd I was thinking about during your last section, where Mr. Podhoretz mentioned the \"Access Hollywood\" tapes, and how that didn`t affect the election.\n\nWell, I also, if I recall, remember that that was the very day that WikiLeaks dumped all of the e-mails that had been hacked by the Russians from Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party.\n\nAnd so, you know, we have to be concerned about our elections and the integrity of our elections.  And Congress needs to get to the bottom of that.  Whether it leads to impeachment or not, we still need to understand how to protect our elections.\n\nKORNACKI:  All right, but quickly there, Congressman, I just want to ask you...\n\nCOHEN:  Our committee has talked about...\n\nKORNACKI:  ... if you guys are going on recess for the rest of the summer, you just went through a whole list of people you want to hear from.  Does that run the clock out?\n\nCOHEN:  Well, first of all, there are subpoenas, and that`s going start a court process.  I don`t expect that the Trump team will not try to stop each and every one of these people, even Corey Lewandowski, who was not a part of the administration, and find every way to stop us.  And so I don`t think it will happen soon.\n\nBut the committee has talked about meeting in August, having hearings in August, and continuing our work in August.  We`re not going to stop because of the recess.  We`re going to continue to try to pursue the truth on behalf of the American people.\n\nThat`s our duty, as the Judiciary Committee of the United States Congress, under Article 1.\n\nKORNACKI:  All right, Congressman Steve Cohen from Tennessee, Caroline Fredrickson, thank you both for being with us.\n\nFREDRICKSON:  Thank you.\n\nKORNACKI:  And be sure to tune in Sunday night, a special report with Ari Melber on the biggest revelations from the Mueller report.  That`s right here, 9:00 p.m. Eastern on MSNBC.\n\nAnd up next, going to head over to the Big Board.  We`re going to dig into some new poll numbers.\n\nAnd, remember, they go Iowa, New Hampshire, there`s Nevada, and then South Carolina, first in the South, first state to go, with a giant black population; 60 percent of the voters in the South Carolina primary will be African-American.\n\nIs Joe Biden still number one there after his recent controversies?\n\nFind out next on HARDBALL.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nKORNACKI:  Welcome back to HARDBALL.\n\nWell, yesterday at this time, we were showing you our new numbers, national numbers, in the Democratic presidential race from our NBC News poll, our first poll after the Democratic debate.\n\nJoe Biden in first place, but Elizabeth Warren not that far behind him, only seven points behind him.  A question we have been asking coming out of that first Democratic debate, how much damage was there to Biden, and, in particular, how much damage to Biden was there among black voters?\n\nBecause, remember, the controversy there on the debate stage and in the days after, it was that showdown he had with Kamala Harris.  It was the issue of busing.  It was racial politics.  What about black voters in particular?\n\nAnd so guess what?  There is also a new poll, in addition to our national poll.  Our friends at FOX News have a new poll from South Carolina, first- in-the-South state with a big black population, certainly on the Democratic side.\n\nAnd here you go.  Look at this.  Overall, in South Carolina, there is Joe Biden out in front, 35 percent.  This looks better than numbers we have seen for him in New Hampshire and Iowa lately, 35 percent for Biden in South Carolina, Sanders in second place, Kamala Harris back in third place here.\n\nLet`s take a look, though, at the racial split in South Carolina.  So, first of all, among white voters in the Democratic primary, there is Biden.  He`s in first place, Kamala Harris actually running in second.\n\nBut we say, more than 60 percent of the Democratic electorate in South Carolina is going to be African-American in the primary next year.  And among black voters in South Carolina, here it is.  Look at that, Joe Biden in first place still, 41 percent, Bernie Sanders actually running in second, Kamala Harris down at third place here at 12 percent.\n\nThis is a big dynamic to keep an eye on in the weeks and months to come.  South Carolina right now is shaping up as Joe Biden`s strongest of the early states.  And the reason it`s the strongest for Biden of the early states is because of the support he has from African-American voters in South Carolina right now.\n\nWe also showed him running strong nationally with African-American voters.  Does that last for him?  Or is Kamala Harris able to surge there?  That`s something to keep an eye on.\n\nWe mentioned this, though.  Again, in Iowa, in 2016, 91 percent of the caucus electorate for Democrats was white.  In New Hampshire, 93 percent of the primary electorate was white.  In Nevada, only 59 percent, large Hispanic population here.\n\nYou get to South Carolina, 61 percent African-American electorate, that`s the first big test for Democratic candidates next year where African- American voters are clearly going to be decisive.  It`s 61 percent in South Carolina.\n\nAnd, remember, if you add up all the primaries across the country, one out of four votes cast next year in the Democratic primaries are going to come from African-American voters.  So, South Carolina looms large as a state individually, and as a barometer potentially of what`s to come.\n\nBiden leading with African-American voters in South Carolina right now.  Does it last?  Let`s see.\n\nUp next:  Trump`s latest retreat on the census is part of a familiar pattern in the Trump White House, talking tough, then backing down.\n\nYou`re watching HARDBALL.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Today, I`m here to say, we are not backing down on our effort to determine the citizenship status of the United States population.\n\nI stand before you to outline new steps my administration is taking to ensure that citizenship is counted, so that we know how many citizens we have in the United States.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nKORNACKI:  Welcome back to HARDBALL.\n\nThat was President Trump yesterday claiming he was not backing down on his demand to add that citizenship question to the 2020 census, when, in fact, he is giving up on that idea.\n\nThe president pulled the plug on the effort just nine days after he declared in a pair of tweets that he had asked the Justice and Commerce Departments to -- quote -- \"do whatever is necessary to bring this most vital of questions and this very important case to a successful conclusion.\"\n\nIt`s the latest in several examples of the president seeming to back down in recent weeks.  At the end of May, he threatened to impose tariffs on Mexico if that country couldn`t stop the flow of migrants into the U.S.  Two days before the deadline, though, he announced they were indefinitely suspended because a deal had been struck with Mexico.\n\nHowever, \"The New York Times\" reported that key points of the deal had been agreed on months before.\n\nAnd a few days later, the president announced nationwide immigration raids.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nQUESTION:  Immigration officials say they don`t know anything about a planned roundup of millions of people next week.\n\nTRUMP:  Well, they know.  They know.  And they`re going to start next week.\n\nThe people that came into the country illegally are going to be removed from the country.  Everybody knows that.  It starts during the course of this next week, maybe even a little bit earlier than that.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nKORNACKI:  A few hours after that statement, though, Trump tweeted he had delayed the raids for two week -- quote -- \"to see if the Democrats and Republicans can get together and work out a solution.\"\n\nThere was also his authorization of airstrikes to retaliate for Iran`s downing of a U.S. drone, with Trump calling them off, he said, at the last minute.\n\nIn a pair of tweets, he acknowledged that -- quote -- \"We were cocked and loaded to retaliate,\" adding that, \"Ten minutes before the strike, I stopped it.\"\n\nAnd then, today, the president offered a new explanation for this latest retreat on the census.\n\nThat`s next.  You`re watching HARDBALL.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nKORNACKI:  Welcome back to HARDBALL.\n\nPresident Trump, as we said, backed down from his demand to add that citizenship question to the census yesterday, two weeks after the Supreme Court rejected his administration`s rationale.\n\nBut even after Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross conceded defeat, the president refused to take no for an answer, contradicting Ross and saying the administration was -- quote -- \"absolutely moving forward.\"\n\nToday, the president insisted again that he had not backed down.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP:  Not only didn`t I back down.  I backed up, because anybody else would have given this up a long time ago.\n\nThe problem is, we had three very unfriendly courts.  They were judges that weren`t exactly in love with this whole thing.  And they were wrong.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nKORNACKI:  For more, I`m joined by Christine Todd Whitman, former New Jersey governor and former EPA administrator, and Tim O`Brien, executive editor of Bloomberg Opinion.\n\nTim, let me just start with you, because you have -- you have observed the Trump method for years.\n\nThis is a situation, as we -- talking about for the last 24 hours, where the Census Bureau had given the president weeks ago, months ago, the option of doing what he`s ultimately settled on doing here, instead of pursuing this through the courts.\n\nBut you don`t see a president out there saying this is any kind of a -- any kind of a back-down from where he was last week.\n\nTIM O`BRIEN, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, BLOOMBERG OPINION:  And, you know, we saw this very early on when they tried to overturn the ACA, and they failed.  And then Trump had a Rose Garden ceremony in which they said it was a victory that they were unable to overturn this core policy that they had come into office to overturn.\n\nHe`s done this for years, which is -- it`s obvious what he`s doing.  He`s trying to say, but it`s not a failure, it`s a victory.\n\nI think the larger issue, beyond just the methodology that he`s deploying here, and that he deploys all the time, is that he`s really divorced from the policy itself.  Whether it`s about overturning the ACA, or trying to change citizenship questions on the census, he`s not really invested in the outcome of the policy.\n\nHe`s more concerned about the theatrics of the event, and more concerned about spinning it so he`s not seen as a loser.  And, in the end of it, he doesn`t -- at the end of the day, he doesn`t care about its impact on the people who the policy affects or, sometimes, when it comes to immigration policy, his own Border Patrol.\n\nHe wants to make sure he`s on a camera or he`s saying \"I won.\"  And if he gets that far, he considers that a win for himself.\n\nKORNACKI:  Well, so, Governor, let me ask you.\n\nWe set up the example here of the planned immigration raids a couple of weeks ago, that, the night before, the president said, never mind, they`re off.\n\nNow they`re being teed up again potentially for this weekend.\n\nCHRISTIE TODD WHITMAN (R), FORMER NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR:  Right.\n\nKORNACKI:  Do you have an expectation whether it`s actually going to happen this weekend?\n\nWHITMAN:  Who knows with this administration?\n\nWhat fascinates me is that there`s no outrage that they always seem to do this on a Sunday, on a Sunday, when people are going to go to church.  They`re not going to go to church if they know that`s where their -- ICE is going to go, which is where it has been going.\n\nI mean, this is an administration that wraps itself in the Bible and talks about how Christian they are.  All these policies are anti that.\n\nBut I would go a little further on what you were saying, because I really believe that part of this is calculated for the base.  He doesn`t care, at the end of the day, because he doesn`t care about the policy.   You`re right.  And he doesn`t care about -- the end of the day about winning.\n\nIn fact, he`s happy to lose in the courts, because then he can blame it on the courts.  Then he can gin up his base a little bit more to say, see how the terrible things are?\n\nKORNACKI:  Is it -- when you say the base, is being seen as the toughest person in Washington on immigration?  Is that...\n\nWHITMAN:  Right.\n\nKORNACKI:  It`s the image, you`re saying, is....\n\nWHITMAN:  On everything on this.\n\nI`m the toughest person, and there are all these obstacles that are thrown my way, so we ought to do away with them.\n\nI mean, he is dismissive of the courts, our legal system.  He is undermining the very basic institutions that make our country what it is today.  And that`s one of the scariest things that I think we see happening.\n\nKORNACKI:  I was curious too.\n\nI wanted to ask you about what we saw yesterday at the announcement, at the press conference about the citizenship question.  You had the president.  You had the attorney general.  You had Bill Barr get up there twice.\n\nWe say this idea of the president selling this as a victory.  The attorney general was very much selling this as a victory for the administration as well, twice, I think, congratulating Trump.  \"Congratulations, Mr. President on this victory today.\"\n\nWhat did you make of that dynamic?\n\nWHITMAN:  Well, I`m very disappointed in William Barr, and have been from the beginning, when he -- I had high hopes for him.\n\nAnd then, in the beginning with the Mueller report, when he tried to preempt it and came out and spun it as, there was complete exoneration.  That`s what he implied through it.  And he knew better than that.\n\nHe misappropriated the whole thing.  And it was -- it was a concerted effort.  It was something that Trump wanted him to do.  And he fell right in with it.\n\nAnd he had a better reputation than that.  I was expecting better from him.\n\nKORNACKI:  All right, we have some breaking news.  I just want to get to this.\n\nI`m finding out about it just as you are here.\n\nBut we can tell you, Vice President Mike Pence and Republican lawmakers have just toured a border facility in McAllen, Texas, where migrants are being detained, amid concerns over the conditions at these centers.\n\nAnd according to the reporter who has been accompanying the vice president inside the facility -- that reporter is Josh Dawsey of \"The Washington Post\" -- the vice president just witnessed 384 men sleeping inside fences in the facility on concrete, with no pillows, no mats, according to Dawsey, again, the reporter accompanying Vice President Pence here.\n\nThe men said they hadn`t showered in weeks.  And the stench was overwhelming.  When the men saw the press, they began shouting they had been there for 40 days or longer.\n\nAgain, just getting a look here, Tim, at what the vice president is seeing.\n\nI can also tell you, according to the reporting here we have got from Josh Dawsey, the vice president just asked about what we were describing and showing there.\n\nHe said: \"I was not surprised by what I saw.  I knew we`d see a system that was overwhelmed.  This is tough stuff.\"\n\nO`BRIEN:  Well, this choreography -- and I think of it as choreography.\n\nI`m very confused about why Mike Pence is at the southern border right now, when they`re about to launch an immigration sweep on Sunday across the country.  I`m very confused by Mike Pence, who is a Christian -- and I think he`s a devout and authentic Christian -- is tolerating policies that are creating a humanitarian crisis.  It`s not an immigration crisis at this point.  It`s a humanitarian crisis.\n\nHe`s done nothing, as far as anyone can tell, on the policy front to try to stem this tide and turn back what is going to be a long-term blight on the U.S.` reputation.  And yet he`s there saying, I didn`t expect to see anything more grotesque than what I`m seeing.  And, in fact, it`s more grotesque than I imagined.\n\nWhat`s he going to do with this experience?  Is he going back to Washington to tell the president he shouldn`t launch raids on Sunday?  He`s going to go back to Washington and tell the government, there`s a better way to help migrants either get from there to here or to go back home as they need to, but we don`t have to leave them without beds, water, toilets and medical care?\n\nKORNACKI:  So, the argument that you hear from the administration, Governor, is that they say they have gotten Mexico to get tougher with arresting migrants in Mexico on their way to the U.S. border.  They say that`s led to a reduction.\n\nThey say they have got this humanitarian aid package through that, in their view, will eventually, I suppose, help the conditions like we`re describing right here.  And then they put the onus, they say, on Democrats to change what Trump refers to as a loophole.\n\nIt gets back to this 1997 consent decree.  That`s what the administration - - I think that`s what you`re hearing from Pence here, the idea of, these are terrible conditions, but we have done our part, is what he seems to be arguing there.\n\nWHITMAN:  Well, first of all, he can`t in good conscience look at that and say, oh, this is what I expected, and kind of dismiss it that way.\n\nIt is a blight on this country.\n\nBut the other side of this is, this administration has been cutting back on aid to organizations like Catholic Charities operating in Venezuela, in the countries where we need to -- where people -- from which people are coming.  And that`s what we need to do.\n\nWe need to support them there, so they don`t feel they have to come to this country.  It`s fine for Mexico to do more on the border, but they don`t have the resources either to handle the people that they`re getting.\n\nAnd they`re trying.  They`re making an effort.  But it`s never going to be enough, if we don`t understand that where we need to solve the problem is back in the countries that are causing the problem.\n\nKORNACKI:  That`s a -- that does seem like a -- I have heard others put the idea out there of a Marshall Plan, I have heard people talk about, for Central America.\n\nThat is a long-term proposition, though, isn`t it, in terms of changing conditions there in a way that`s going to address the desire to come to the United States?\n\nWHITMAN:  Yes, but, unfortunately, there are not short-term solutions that we have got, save what you see, which is not helping -- making us any more secure, particularly when you do things like separate children from their families and hold them in those kinds of conditions.\n\nIt affects them.  They`re young.  Their brains are forming.  They`re not going to be our friends when they get a little older, and especially the teenaged ones.\n\nThey`re where ISIS and other -- other groups of people who don`t want to do us good are going to go to recruit.  I mean, this is -- this is not good for the country.  It just isn`t good for the country.  And these conditions are appalling.\n\nKORNACKI:  And that -- Tim, it does strike me we always try to figure out the politics of immigration.  I think they`re very complicated.\n\nPeople often have contradictory views within themselves.  But the two moments I have noticed in the last year, I would say, was the revelation of the child separation policy, and then the description and now pictures of the conditions at these facilities.\n\nO`BRIEN:  Yes.\n\nKORNACKI:  Those two seem to be moments there when you start to get a broad consensus out there among people, that it does seem to cut across some of the familiar divides, and people seem to say, no, this overall is not a good idea.\n\nO`BRIEN:  Well, and, overwhelmingly, when there`s polls on immigration, there is a broad national consensus that immigration is a good thing for the United States.\n\nThat`s not where the divide emerges.  The divide emerges on, how do you handle immigration?  What`s the right way to bring people into the country?\n\nAnd this administration, however, is trying to score political points for its base.  It`s not actually trying to develop a sophisticated policy that does two things, what Governor Whitman said, which is address the economic distress and the drug wars in Honduras, Guatemala, in other parts of Central America that are driving largely women and children to the border.\n\nThese aren`t Mexican laborers who came in the past.  It`s a different population of people.  And then having a system at the border that actually welcomes them and then makes decisions in a rational, constructive way about what their future is going to be.\n\nThat`s not building a wall, and that`s not putting them inside jails.\n\nKORNACKI:  All right, Tim O`Brien, Christine Todd Whitman, thank you both for joining us.\n\nWe will be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nKORNACKI:  And that`s going to do it for HARDBALL for now.  I`m Steve Kornacki.  Chris Matthews will be back here on Monday.\n\nThank you for joining us.\n\nAnd \"ALL IN WITH CHRIS HAYES\" starts right now.\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

      "text": "In the fight over the courts, Republicans pretend to be victims\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nBy Steve Benen\n\nAs Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's Senate confirmation hearings were poised to begin, it was difficult to know exactly what to expect from the Judiciary Committee's Republicans. Would they try to tear her down? If so, what would they focus on? Would they complain about the process? Would they take a more low-key approach realizing she's likely to be confirmed whether the GOP minority likes it or not?\n\nIt quickly became apparent that the panel's Republican members had settled on a different kind of approach: They wanted to talk, at great length, about their sense of victimhood. NBC News noted that the first day of hearings quickly became \"a venting session\" for GOP senators.\n\nThe trauma over past Supreme Court battles runs deep - and Republicans didn't hide it. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the top Republican on the committee, began his party's remarks at the hearing by reminding of previous confirmations when the audience interrupted him.... He and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., vented about Democrats' treatment of then-Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Graham dug back about 20 years to complain about Democrats' treatment of President George W. Bush's appellate nominees Janice Rogers Brown, a Black woman who was ultimately confirmed, and Miguel Estrada, a Hispanic man who was filibustered.\n\nOne by one, Republicans whined about the Kavanaugh hearings. And Robert Bork's 1987 nomination. And Clarence Thomas' 1991 nomination. And Janice Rogers Brown's 2005 nomination. And Miguel Estrada's 2003 nomination.\n\nWhat did any of this have to do with Judge Jackson? Literally nothing. Her presence - indeed, her nomination - seemed largely irrelevant to the committee's Republican members.\n\nThey had spotlights and microphones, and by golly, they wanted everyone to know just how sorry they felt for themselves. Those rascally Democrats have been big meanies for many years, or so we were told, and Jackson's confirmation hearings provided a convenient platform for GOP senators to flaunt their sense of grievance.\n\nThere was, however, a relevant detail that went largely ignored. As MSNBC's Chris Hayes noted , \"Conservatives love nothing more than to be both victor and victim.\"\n\nQuite right. There's been a multi-year political fight over the direction of the federal judiciary, and it's led to a political dynamic that's genuinely ridiculous: The partisans who won the fight are the same partisans whining the loudest now.\n\nNot to put too fine a point on this, but to hear Republicans complain for hours on end was a ridiculous display given their many successes . GOP senators tried to shut down the confirmation process during much of Barack Obama's presidency, and they successfully shut it down during the Democrat's final two years in office.\n\nThey stole a Supreme Court seat in 2016. They threatened to leave a vacancy unfilled for at least four years - if not longer. They exercised the \"nuclear option\" to confirm Justice Neil Gorsuch. They ignored evidence, popular will, and propriety to confirm Justice Brett Kavanaugh. They rejected their own purported principles to confirm Justice Amy Coney Barrett in the midst of a presidential election.\n\nThey spent Donald Trump's term ignoring governing and investing an inordinate amount of time into confirming highly dubious conservatives with thin records, some of whom had barely seen the inside of a courtroom.\n\nThese guys shouldn't be whining incessantly; they should be celebrating their victory. There's a 6-3 far-right majority on the Supreme Court, creating the most conservative high court in nearly a century, and the result is likely to help shape American public life for the next several decades.\n\nThey are not traumatized. They have nothing about which to \"vent.\" For Senate Republicans to see themselves as victims is to strip reality of any meaning.\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

Activate your online access\n\nTo write a letter on behalf of Juan Raul Garza, as well as the other prisoners currently\non state and federal death row, visit our Death Row Roll Call .\n\nNo one better understands the arbitrariness of the death penalty than Juan Raul Garza. A Hispanic man sentenced to death in Texas for three drug-related murders, he is scheduled to be executed on June 19. This past December, President Clinton put off Garza's execution date because a Justice Department study had raised serious questions about racial, ethnic and geographical disparities in the administration of the federal death penalty. Garza's case raised these questions in a particularly direct way, because the study found that the federal death penalty is disproportionately sought and obtained against black and Hispanic defendants, and disproportionately meted out in a handful of states, Texas the leader among them. Had Garza been white or had he committed his crimes somewhere other than Texas, he probably would not be on death row today. To write a letter on behalf of Juan Raul Garza, as well as the other prisoners currently\non state and federal death row, visit our Death Row Roll Call . Earlier this month, however, Attorney General John Ashcroft announced that there is no evidence of bias in the federal death penalty, and the government is now preparing to execute Garza. So what changed? Not the evidence. Ashcroft issued a supplementary report, but it contained no new relevant information and failed to undertake the analysis required to determine whether the federal death-penalty disparities were attributable to bias. Ashcroft said that such a study would take too long and might not be definitive in any event. In its place, his report offers only speculation as to why racial or ethnic disparities might exist in a handful of particular jurisdictions. In a hearing on June 14, Ashcroft backpedaled and agreed that further study was needed. But in the meantime, he insists on going forward with executing Garza. The facts are unchanged, and they remain deeply troubling. Blacks and Hispanics, who make up about one-quarter of the general population, are more than 80 percent of those on federal death row. Federal prosecutors are twice as likely to reach plea agreements avoiding death sentences with white than with black and Hispanic capital defendants. And Texas, a single state, accounts for nearly a third of all federal death-row inmates. Ashcroft stresses that of all federal cases that could have been tried as capital cases, the Attorney General actually authorized the death penalty more often against white defendants than minority defendants. But since over 90 percent of white murder defendants killed white victims, that statistic may simply reflect favoritism toward white victims. At the federal level, the Attorney General has authorized the death penalty twice as often when victims are white than when they are black. Yet the Attorney General's latest report fails even to mention this fact. Ashcroft's report also emphasizes the many procedural safeguards the federal government has put in place to ensure that race does not affect the imposition of death, including instructions to jurors, appointment of competent defense counsel and centralized review in the Justice Department of all federal death-penalty cases. But the bottom line is that despite these safeguards, the federal system has resulted in substantial disparities. The root of the problem is that there simply is no fair and objective way to isolate, from among the approximately 20,000 homicides that take place each year, the 100 or so that will lead to the ultimate punishment of death. In the end, race, class, ethnicity, geography or the political inclinations of the Attorney General are as likely to make the difference as anything else. Just ask Juan Garza.\n\nTo write a letter on behalf of Juan Raul Garza, as well as the other prisoners currently\non state and federal death row, visit our Death Row Roll Call .\n\nEarlier this month, however, Attorney General John Ashcroft announced that there is no evidence of bias in the federal death penalty, and the government is now preparing to execute Garza.

And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Comfort is easy to find in Laramie, if you're a yuppie like me. I feel like I am on vacation because luxury restaurants are so cheap here; my bed-and-breakfast is the nicest I have ever stayed in. By my standards, it is cheap: $57 a night. And how does it feel to be a lesbian here? Fabulous. Annie Moore's is not only a Victorian filled with sensuous period furniture, it has a copy of Rubyfruit Jungle on the guest bookshelf. Lesbian and gay lovers stay in these sexy little rooms all the time, along with the University of Wyoming's most prestigious visitors. Sometimes the town's yups come to stay for the night just to feel well-off and taken care of. The charming innkeeper, Ann Acuff, who is straight, makes me feel at home by telling about the night she spent at a lesbian bar the last time she was in New York. Matthew Shepard had much to love about living in Laramie, too; it is a town that caters to moneyed people of any sexual orientation. The guidebooks describe a place that \"violates one's expectations of a Wyoming town\" (a fascinating verb choice) because it is full of \"flower shops, cafes, bookstores, vegetarian restaurants, bars that attract reggae or blues bands, and galleries filled with handcrafted items from all over the planet.\" In other words, it is very like my own beloved townlet, Park Slope, Brooklyn, which could be the model for gentrified progressive places everywhere. Well-off people move to Laramie by the score from out of state. (\"When you buy a million-dollar home in Laramie, it's much, much bigger than a million-dollar home in California,\" observes Wende Barker, a local progressive politician.) The town is \"an oasis of tolerance,\" says Jason Marsden, an openly gay reporter at the Casper Star-Tribune . \"It's the only county in the state that can be counted on to vote Democratic,\" says Barker. And it is full to bursting with scrumptious consumer goods. If I weren't here to write about an antigay torture-murder, I would be buying pottery at Earth, Wind and Fire, pricing silver at Green Gold, acquiring delicate, feathery pastries at Jeffrey's Too. Matthew did. He spent money for fun, the way I often do; he bought fabulous clothes; he shelled out money for delightful items to improve his physical appearance in a way that straight men rarely feel entitled to do.

When Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney, both 21 years old, walked into the Fireside Lounge and encountered Matthew Shepard, they might have been looking at a wood nymph. I'm not going to say who was more oppressed, because all three of them can bear that label easily, but their experience was each other's mirror image. When Russell's mother froze to death last January after staggering out of a bar, few people in town were surprised. Russell and his mom, a hotel maid, both lived in the part of Laramie that is home to many of the people who work at the boutiques, restaurants, hotels and houses that the university people enjoy. The government doesn't even pave the streets there. It doesn't plow West Laramie when it snows; the falling-down trailers and junked cars can wait until it melts. Recently, the City Council refused to appropriate taxpayer funds to put up a deaf child crossing sign in front of a deaf child's home. \"Next thing you know, there'll be a blind child wanting a sign,\" explained councilman E.G. Meyer. As it goes here with deaf children, so it goes here with busboys, manual laborers, cleaning women. On the gleaming streets of downtown, I get my boots shined by a 70-year-old Hispanic man who tells me that he was always pushed off the streets for being Mexican, growing up here. Actually, in this respect, too, Laramie is a lot like Park Slope, where on a recent Friday morning scores of welfare recipients were tidying up Prospect Park for me as I got ready for my morning run. Pleasure, in both our towns, always seems to come at someone's expense. It's the way we were almost all taught about sex to begin with, as though men always hurt women by getting it, and we gradually learned the same lesson about delights of every kind. Russell and Aaron probably believe it more than most. Russell's late mother was the city's most famous battering victim, and he was severely battered by her boyfriends. Aaron's mother often locked him in a basement during his childhood, and as a result, perhaps, \"his opinion of women has never been very high,\" according to a woman who knew him in high school. She remembers his girlfriend coming to school with black eyes. Who's on top and who's on the bottom seems to be a matter of enormous intensity in this city, perhaps even more than in the rest of America. The feminist movement has never been very strong here, and the incidence of rape and domestic violence against women and children is extraordinarily high. Last year, approximately one in twelve local women reported battering or sexual assault on herself or a child to Laramie's antiviolence project. That's shocking, considering that more than half of all rapes and battering cases are never reported at all. Most media coverage has attributed Shepard's murder to the supposed backwardness and endemic homophobia of rural people, inflaming the bitterness Laramieans have felt for years over the fact that the rest of the country sees them as dumb yokels. (The uneducated and poor are especially despised here because of the sense that they contribute to that image.) In fact, Laramie was the likeliest place in the state for an antigay murder to happen, not because of its backwardness but because of its progressiveness and its pockets of wealth and poverty. Explaining why gets tricky, because we are in the realm of cultural memes that bear only the slightest relation to reality. Comfort and voluptuousness (and, of course, consumerism) have been linked in the public mind with effeminacy and homosexuality for decades. Most antigay murders, in fact, aren't committed on the prairie but in liberal cities like New York and San Francisco, where the perception of gay privilege and boys' brutally inculcated fear of being feminine results in scores of antigay murders every year. The left has never been particularly eager to examine the ways that class, victimhood and violence are coded in the language of gender, but examining this could help us understand why so many boys and men of all classes between the ages of 15 and 22 are so worried about being on the bottom that they search gay-friendly neighborhoods for gay men to attack. Cultural dogma holds that men must demonstrate at every turn that they are not on the bottom, even if they actually are. Laramie, the only college town in a state where a number of people hunt for food, is obsessed with status, and Russell and Aaron were reviled for being \"losers,\" dropouts and poor. They were also addicted to crystal meth. Long ago, Russell had been an honors student and wanted badly to go to college, but instead he wound up as a roofer earning $12,000 a year. Aaron, for his part, saw himself as such a moron that when he won some money in an insurance settlement after his mother's death from a botched hysterectomy, he went out and bought an enormous necklace that displayed his nickname, \"Dopey.\" Almost no one in our society is comfortable seeing straight men as victims, certainly not the men themselves. But until they do, men like Russell and Aaron will continue to prove their nonvictim status by attacking men like Matthew. And no matter how many gay people homophobes know-like the ones Russell and Aaron knew in Russell's girlfriend's family-gay people will continue to be seen as the enemy. Picture the three of them at the Fireside, a bar downtown where university and non-university people mix. Even Aaron and Russell's friends treat them like wimps-they often put Aaron in a headlock and call him \"the shrimp\"-and tonight the Fireside's bartender is shunning them because literally they have dirty hands. And maybe also because they can't afford to tip. They don't even have the $5.50 to pay for the pitcher of beer they just drank, and they're turning their pockets inside out looking for it, annoying the bartender. It's humiliating. All their cash is in nickels and dimes. Then a beautiful boy at the end of the bar asks if he can help. McKinney and Henderson are small men, but this boy is smaller. He's the same age as they are but wearing incredibly stylish clothes, a clean shave, shiny patent leather shoes. His hair is bleached; his hands on the bar are white and flowerlike. He himself looks like an emblem of everything they have never been allowed to be. He's a child-man, or looks like one: still wearing braces, but with enough money to pay for strangers. The bartender loves him. Matthew thanks (and tips) him with a marvelous politeness after every round. Russell and Aaron barely know how to speak that way, like someone who's fluent in Arabic, French and German, who was able to be openly gay in high school (at a fabulous private school in Switzerland); like someone who's already chosen a career in international human rights. They stare at him across the bar (witnesses differ on whether they take his cash or not). Matthew is, quite probably, being flirtatious. (\"Matthew was flirty with everyone ,\" says Jason Marsden, who was a close friend.) But these two boys have faces that might be read as gay, and Henderson is actually cute. There are good grounds for believing that something passed, both ways, between them and Shepard. Media reports to the contrary, gay-bashing is an erotic crime, not just a violent one. Most bashers, like Russell and Aaron on this evening, proposition their victim before they kill. And it is easy to see why Matthew would arouse these feelings. His very charm and generosity are seductive. Russell and Aaron could never give in to the allure of such flirtatious femininity in another man, but that doesn't mean they haven't felt it: Most men do. For Russell and Aaron it is an attraction tinged with envy. They have never been allowed to be this feminine-or even, you might say, this nice. They have never been allowed to take such pleasure in fabrics and textures as this boy is taking in his expensive clothes, but they have wanted to. Matthew's interest in them makes him infinitely more threatening; this feminine boy has made a masculine pass by offering to pay for their drinks. His wealth threatens to put them on the bottom where they have always been, but this time, in relation to a tiny, femmy boy. He tells them he is gay and they say that they're gay, too. \"Let's go back to Aaron's place,\" they say, \"and get to know each other better\" (as Aaron's girlfriend will recount on 20/20 ). Once he gets into their truck, Aaron takes out his gun and smashes the butt of it into Matthew's head. \"We're not gay, and you just got jacked,\" he yells. I'm struck by how that sentence resembles an equation: We're not gay and you just got jacked. Russell and Aaron aren't \"gay\"-here, a synonym for \"powerless\"-because Matthew just got \"jacked.\" As they beat him with the .357 Magnum and their fists, Russell laughs out loud. They take his wallet from him, further confirming their superiority. Shepard begs for his life, which only makes him more equivalent in their eyes to the piece of nothing that they want him to be. Henderson and McKinney drive him out to a prairie owned by the Warren Livestock Company, where everyone in Laramie goes to commune with nature. People bike and run and walk their dogs here; and though the livestock company owns it, people act like it is everyone's. The prairie is windswept and rugged, and Russell and Aaron would have seen incredibly beautiful stars at midnight when they took him there. I think it's significant that they killed Shepard in such a beautiful place. Many people have noticed something strangely religious about this crime, and the attack looks more and more so the more you walk around the site. The fence to which they tied him is surrounded by long, flat stones that look like altar stones. And the fence itself is small, too tiny to keep out even a baby deer; it is purely symbolic, like a gold cross on a chain. It is the idea of a fence, and that's enough; they were demonstrating the idea of their election, their superiority. The press, in calling it a crucifixion, was not far off; it certainly looks like a site for holy sacrifice. While they're whaling on Shepard, they repeatedly hit him in the groin. They have to hit him in the groin: What else will finally get across the idea that they are not the victims? One thing that is perpetually underemphasized in the discussion of gay-bashings is the sense of overcoming one's disgrace and terror. Almost all the antigay murderers in Arthur Dong's documentary Licensed to Kill mention their fear of being raped or beaten up, as they were by men in the past. In a major study of gay-bashers, almost all expressed fears of being raped by the men they sought to beat. In the minds of bashers, gay-bashing means not being attacked anymore (never mind that gay people haven't hurt them). Aaron and Russell, too, have been victims their whole lives, and now they want to be the opposite. That's why they sacrifice him. Even after they force him to tell his address so that they can rob his house, even after his nose is broken and his skull is cracked, there remains a taint of victimhood on them that they cannot expunge except by leaving Shepard tied there in their stead. They even remove his shoes, out of some insane fear that he might get up and walk away. He isn't spread-eagled, like Christ on the cross, but lying on the ground tied by his wrists, like an animal offering. In that holy place, it feels like all their worthlessness has been redeemed. Shepard's face is covered in blood.\n\nComfort is easy to find in Laramie, if you're a yuppie like me. I feel like I am on vacation because luxury restaurants are so cheap here; my bed-and-breakfast is the nicest I have ever stayed in. By my standards, it is cheap: $57 a night.

Pleasure, in both our towns, always seems to come at someone's expense. It's the way we were almost all taught about sex to begin with, as though men always hurt women by getting it, and we gradually learned the same lesson about delights of every kind. Russell and Aaron probably believe it more than most. Russell's late mother was the city's most famous battering victim, and he was severely battered by her boyfriends. Aaron's mother often locked him in a basement during his childhood, and as a result, perhaps, \"his opinion of women has never been very high,\" according to a woman who knew him in high school. She remembers his girlfriend coming to school with black eyes. Who's on top and who's on the bottom seems to be a matter of enormous intensity in this city, perhaps even more than in the rest of America. The feminist movement has never been very strong here, and the incidence of rape and domestic violence against women and children is extraordinarily high. Last year, approximately one in twelve local women reported battering or sexual assault on herself or a child to Laramie's antiviolence project. That's shocking, considering that more than half of all rapes and battering cases are never reported at all. Most media coverage has attributed Shepard's murder to the supposed backwardness and endemic homophobia of rural people, inflaming the bitterness Laramieans have felt for years over the fact that the rest of the country sees them as dumb yokels. (The uneducated and poor are especially despised here because of the sense that they contribute to that image.) In fact, Laramie was the likeliest place in the state for an antigay murder to happen, not because of its backwardness but because of its progressiveness and its pockets of wealth and poverty. Explaining why gets tricky, because we are in the realm of cultural memes that bear only the slightest relation to reality. Comfort and voluptuousness (and, of course, consumerism) have been linked in the public mind with effeminacy and homosexuality for decades. Most antigay murders, in fact, aren't committed on the prairie but in liberal cities like New York and San Francisco, where the perception of gay privilege and boys' brutally inculcated fear of being feminine results in scores of antigay murders every year. The left has never been particularly eager to examine the ways that class, victimhood and violence are coded in the language of gender, but examining this could help us understand why so many boys and men of all classes between the ages of 15 and 22 are so worried about being on the bottom that they search gay-friendly neighborhoods for gay men to attack. Cultural dogma holds that men must demonstrate at every turn that they are not on the bottom, even if they actually are. Laramie, the only college town in a state where a number of people hunt for food, is obsessed with status, and Russell and Aaron were reviled for being \"losers,\" dropouts and poor. They were also addicted to crystal meth. Long ago, Russell had been an honors student and wanted badly to go to college, but instead he wound up as a roofer earning $12,000 a year. Aaron, for his part, saw himself as such a moron that when he won some money in an insurance settlement after his mother's death from a botched hysterectomy, he went out and bought an enormous necklace that displayed his nickname, \"Dopey.\" Almost no one in our society is comfortable seeing straight men as victims, certainly not the men themselves. But until they do, men like Russell and Aaron will continue to prove their nonvictim status by attacking men like Matthew. And no matter how many gay people homophobes know-like the ones Russell and Aaron knew in Russell's girlfriend's family-gay people will continue to be seen as the enemy. Picture the three of them at the Fireside, a bar downtown where university and non-university people mix. Even Aaron and Russell's friends treat them like wimps-they often put Aaron in a headlock and call him \"the shrimp\"-and tonight the Fireside's bartender is shunning them because literally they have dirty hands. And maybe also because they can't afford to tip. They don't even have the $5.50 to pay for the pitcher of beer they just drank, and they're turning their pockets inside out looking for it, annoying the bartender. It's humiliating. All their cash is in nickels and dimes. Then a beautiful boy at the end of the bar asks if he can help. McKinney and Henderson are small men, but this boy is smaller. He's the same age as they are but wearing incredibly stylish clothes, a clean shave, shiny patent leather shoes. His hair is bleached; his hands on the bar are white and flowerlike. He himself looks like an emblem of everything they have never been allowed to be. He's a child-man, or looks like one: still wearing braces, but with enough money to pay for strangers. The bartender loves him. Matthew thanks (and tips) him with a marvelous politeness after every round. Russell and Aaron barely know how to speak that way, like someone who's fluent in Arabic, French and German, who was able to be openly gay in high school (at a fabulous private school in Switzerland); like someone who's already chosen a career in international human rights. They stare at him across the bar (witnesses differ on whether they take his cash or not). Matthew is, quite probably, being flirtatious. (\"Matthew was flirty with everyone ,\" says Jason Marsden, who was a close friend.) But these two boys have faces that might be read as gay, and Henderson is actually cute. There are good grounds for believing that something passed, both ways, between them and Shepard. Media reports to the contrary, gay-bashing is an erotic crime, not just a violent one. Most bashers, like Russell and Aaron on this evening, proposition their victim before they kill. And it is easy to see why Matthew would arouse these feelings. His very charm and generosity are seductive. Russell and Aaron could never give in to the allure of such flirtatious femininity in another man, but that doesn't mean they haven't felt it: Most men do. For Russell and Aaron it is an attraction tinged with envy. They have never been allowed to be this feminine-or even, you might say, this nice. They have never been allowed to take such pleasure in fabrics and textures as this boy is taking in his expensive clothes, but they have wanted to. Matthew's interest in them makes him infinitely more threatening; this feminine boy has made a masculine pass by offering to pay for their drinks. His wealth threatens to put them on the bottom where they have always been, but this time, in relation to a tiny, femmy boy. He tells them he is gay and they say that they're gay, too. \"Let's go back to Aaron's place,\" they say, \"and get to know each other better\" (as Aaron's girlfriend will recount on 20/20 ). Once he gets into their truck, Aaron takes out his gun and smashes the butt of it into Matthew's head. \"We're not gay, and you just got jacked,\" he yells. I'm struck by how that sentence resembles an equation: We're not gay and you just got jacked. Russell and Aaron aren't \"gay\"-here, a synonym for \"powerless\"-because Matthew just got \"jacked.\" As they beat him with the .357 Magnum and their fists, Russell laughs out loud. They take his wallet from him, further confirming their superiority. Shepard begs for his life, which only makes him more equivalent in their eyes to the piece of nothing that they want him to be. Henderson and McKinney drive him out to a prairie owned by the Warren Livestock Company, where everyone in Laramie goes to commune with nature. People bike and run and walk their dogs here; and though the livestock company owns it, people act like it is everyone's. The prairie is windswept and rugged, and Russell and Aaron would have seen incredibly beautiful stars at midnight when they took him there. I think it's significant that they killed Shepard in such a beautiful place. Many people have noticed something strangely religious about this crime, and the attack looks more and more so the more you walk around the site. The fence to which they tied him is surrounded by long, flat stones that look like altar stones. And the fence itself is small, too tiny to keep out even a baby deer; it is purely symbolic, like a gold cross on a chain. It is the idea of a fence, and that's enough; they were demonstrating the idea of their election, their superiority. The press, in calling it a crucifixion, was not far off; it certainly looks like a site for holy sacrifice. While they're whaling on Shepard, they repeatedly hit him in the groin. They have to hit him in the groin: What else will finally get across the idea that they are not the victims? One thing that is perpetually underemphasized in the discussion of gay-bashings is the sense of overcoming one's disgrace and terror. Almost all the antigay murderers in Arthur Dong's documentary Licensed to Kill mention their fear of being raped or beaten up, as they were by men in the past. In a major study of gay-bashers, almost all expressed fears of being raped by the men they sought to beat. In the minds of bashers, gay-bashing means not being attacked anymore (never mind that gay people haven't hurt them). Aaron and Russell, too, have been victims their whole lives, and now they want to be the opposite. That's why they sacrifice him. Even after they force him to tell his address so that they can rob his house, even after his nose is broken and his skull is cracked, there remains a taint of victimhood on them that they cannot expunge except by leaving Shepard tied there in their stead. They even remove his shoes, out of some insane fear that he might get up and walk away. He isn't spread-eagled, like Christ on the cross, but lying on the ground tied by his wrists, like an animal offering. In that holy place, it feels like all their worthlessness has been redeemed. Shepard's face is covered in blood.\n\nMatthew Shepard had much to love about living in Laramie, too; it is a town that caters to moneyed people of any sexual orientation. The guidebooks describe a place that \"violates one's expectations of a Wyoming town\" (a fascinating verb choice) because it is full of \"flower shops, cafes, bookstores, vegetarian restaurants, bars that attract reggae or blues bands, and galleries filled with handcrafted items from all over the planet.\" In other words, it is very like my own beloved townlet, Park Slope, Brooklyn, which could be the model for gentrified progressive places everywhere. Well-off people move to Laramie by the score from out of state. (\"When you buy a million-dollar home in Laramie, it's much, much bigger than a million-dollar home in California,\" observes Wende Barker, a local progressive politician.) The town is \"an oasis of tolerance,\" says Jason Marsden, an openly gay reporter at the Casper Star-Tribune . \"It's the only county in the state that can be counted on to vote Democratic,\" says Barker. And it is full to bursting with scrumptious consumer goods. If I weren't here to write about an antigay torture-murder, I would be buying pottery at Earth, Wind and Fire, pricing silver at Green Gold, acquiring delicate, feathery pastries at Jeffrey's Too. Matthew did. He spent money for fun, the way I often do; he bought fabulous clothes; he shelled out money for delightful items to improve his physical appearance in a way that straight men rarely feel entitled to do.

When Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney, both 21 years old, walked into the Fireside Lounge and encountered Matthew Shepard, they might have been looking at a wood nymph. I'm not going to say who was more oppressed, because all three of them can bear that label easily, but their experience was each other's mirror image. When Russell's mother froze to death last January after staggering out of a bar, few people in town were surprised. Russell and his mom, a hotel maid, both lived in the part of Laramie that is home to many of the people who work at the boutiques, restaurants, hotels and houses that the university people enjoy. The government doesn't even pave the streets there. It doesn't plow West Laramie when it snows; the falling-down trailers and junked cars can wait until it melts. Recently, the City Council refused to appropriate taxpayer funds to put up a deaf child crossing sign in front of a deaf child's home. \"Next thing you know, there'll be a blind child wanting a sign,\" explained councilman E.G. Meyer. As it goes here with deaf children, so it goes here with busboys, manual laborers, cleaning women. On the gleaming streets of downtown, I get my boots shined by a 70-year-old Hispanic man who tells me that he was always pushed off the streets for being Mexican, growing up here. Actually, in this respect, too, Laramie is a lot like Park Slope, where on a recent Friday morning scores of welfare recipients were tidying up Prospect Park for me as I got ready for my morning run.

People bike and run and walk their dogs here; and though the livestock company owns it, people act like it is everyone's. The prairie is windswept and rugged, and Russell and Aaron would have seen incredibly beautiful stars at midnight when they took him there. I think it's significant that they killed Shepard in such a beautiful place. Many people have noticed something strangely religious about this crime, and the attack looks more and more so the more you walk around the site. The fence to which they tied him is surrounded by long, flat stones that look like altar stones. And the fence itself is small, too tiny to keep out even a baby deer; it is purely symbolic, like a gold cross on a chain. It is the idea of a fence, and that's enough; they were demonstrating the idea of their election, their superiority. The press, in calling it a crucifixion, was not far off; it certainly looks like a site for holy sacrifice. While they're whaling on Shepard, they repeatedly hit him in the groin. They have to hit him in the groin: What else will finally get across the idea that they are not the victims? One thing that is perpetually underemphasized in the discussion of gay-bashings is the sense of overcoming one's disgrace and terror. Almost all the antigay murderers in Arthur Dong's documentary Licensed to Kill mention their fear of being raped or beaten up, as they were by men in the past. In a major study of gay-bashers, almost all expressed fears of being raped by the men they sought to beat. In the minds of bashers, gay-bashing means not being attacked anymore (never mind that gay people haven't hurt them). Aaron and Russell, too, have been victims their whole lives, and now they want to be the opposite. That's why they sacrifice him. Even after they force him to tell his address so that they can rob his house, even after his nose is broken and his skull is cracked, there remains a taint of victimhood on them that they cannot expunge except by leaving Shepard tied there in their stead. They even remove his shoes, out of some insane fear that he might get up and walk away. He isn't spread-eagled, like Christ on the cross, but lying on the ground tied by his wrists, like an animal offering. In that holy place, it feels like all their worthlessness has been redeemed. Shepard's face is covered in blood.\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nOf course, that's only one side of this story. When Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney, both 21 years old, walked into the Fireside Lounge and encountered Matthew Shepard, they might have been looking at a wood nymph. I'm not going to say who was more oppressed, because all three of them can bear that label easily, but their experience was each other's mirror image. When Russell's mother froze to death last January after staggering out of a bar, few people in town were surprised. Russell and his mom, a hotel maid, both lived in the part of Laramie that is home to many of the people who work at the boutiques, restaurants, hotels and houses that the university people enjoy. The government doesn't even pave the streets there. It doesn't plow West Laramie when it snows; the falling-down trailers and junked cars can wait until it melts. Recently, the City Council refused to appropriate taxpayer funds to put up a deaf child crossing sign in front of a deaf child's home. \"Next thing you know, there'll be a blind child wanting a sign,\" explained councilman E.G. Meyer. As it goes here with deaf children, so it goes here with busboys, manual laborers, cleaning women. On the gleaming streets of downtown, I get my boots shined by a 70-year-old Hispanic man who tells me that he was always pushed off the streets for being Mexican, growing up here. Actually, in this respect, too, Laramie is a lot like Park Slope, where on a recent Friday morning scores of welfare recipients were tidying up Prospect Park for me as I got ready for my morning run. Pleasure, in both our towns, always seems to come at someone's expense. It's the way we were almost all taught about sex to begin with, as though men always hurt women by getting it, and we gradually learned the same lesson about delights of every kind. Russell and Aaron probably believe it more than most. Russell's late mother was the city's most famous battering victim, and he was severely battered by her boyfriends. Aaron's mother often locked him in a basement during his childhood, and as a result, perhaps, \"his opinion of women has never been very high,\" according to a woman who knew him in high school. She remembers his girlfriend coming to school with black eyes. Who's on top and who's on the bottom seems to be a matter of enormous intensity in this city, perhaps even more than in the rest of America. The feminist movement has never been very strong here, and the incidence of rape and domestic violence against women and children is extraordinarily high. Last year, approximately one in twelve local women reported battering or sexual assault on herself or a child to Laramie's antiviolence project. That's shocking, considering that more than half of all rapes and battering cases are never reported at all. Most media coverage has attributed Shepard's murder to the supposed backwardness and endemic homophobia of rural people, inflaming the bitterness Laramieans have felt for years over the fact that the rest of the country sees them as dumb yokels. (The uneducated and poor are especially despised here because of the sense that they contribute to that image.) In fact, Laramie was the likeliest place in the state for an antigay murder to happen, not because of its backwardness but because of its progressiveness and its pockets of wealth and poverty. Explaining why gets tricky, because we are in the realm of cultural memes that bear only the slightest relation to reality. Comfort and voluptuousness (and, of course, consumerism) have been linked in the public mind with effeminacy and homosexuality for decades. Most antigay murders, in fact, aren't committed on the prairie but in liberal cities like New York and San Francisco, where the perception of gay privilege and boys' brutally inculcated fear of being feminine results in scores of antigay murders every year. The left has never been particularly eager to examine the ways that class, victimhood and violence are coded in the language of gender, but examining this could help us understand why so many boys and men of all classes between the ages of 15 and 22 are so worried about being on the bottom that they search gay-friendly neighborhoods for gay men to attack. Cultural dogma holds that men must demonstrate at every turn that they are not on the bottom, even if they actually are. Laramie, the only college town in a state where a number of people hunt for food, is obsessed with status, and Russell and Aaron were reviled for being \"losers,\" dropouts and poor. They were also addicted to crystal meth. Long ago, Russell had been an honors student and wanted badly to go to college, but instead he wound up as a roofer earning $12,000 a year. Aaron, for his part, saw himself as such a moron that when he won some money in an insurance settlement after his mother's death from a botched hysterectomy, he went out and bought an enormous necklace that displayed his nickname, \"Dopey.\" Almost no one in our society is comfortable seeing straight men as victims, certainly not the men themselves. But until they do, men like Russell and Aaron will continue to prove their nonvictim status by attacking men like Matthew. And no matter how many gay people homophobes know-like the ones Russell and Aaron knew in Russell's girlfriend's family-gay people will continue to be seen as the enemy. Picture the three of them at the Fireside, a bar downtown where university and non-university people mix. Even Aaron and Russell's friends treat them like wimps-they often put Aaron in a headlock and call him \"the shrimp\"-and tonight the Fireside's bartender is shunning them because literally they have dirty hands. And maybe also because they can't afford to tip. They don't even have the $5.50 to pay for the pitcher of beer they just drank, and they're turning their pockets inside out looking for it, annoying the bartender. It's humiliating. All their cash is in nickels and dimes. Then a beautiful boy at the end of the bar asks if he can help. McKinney and Henderson are small men, but this boy is smaller. He's the same age as they are but wearing incredibly stylish clothes, a clean shave, shiny patent leather shoes. His hair is bleached; his hands on the bar are white and flowerlike. He himself looks like an emblem of everything they have never been allowed to be. He's a child-man, or looks like one: still wearing braces, but with enough money to pay for strangers. The bartender loves him. Matthew thanks (and tips) him with a marvelous politeness after every round. Russell and Aaron barely know how to speak that way, like someone who's fluent in Arabic, French and German, who was able to be openly gay in high school (at a fabulous private school in Switzerland); like someone who's already chosen a career in international human rights. They stare at him across the bar (witnesses differ on whether they take his cash or not). Matthew is, quite probably, being flirtatious. (\"Matthew was flirty with everyone ,\" says Jason Marsden, who was a close friend.) But these two boys have faces that might be read as gay, and Henderson is actually cute. There are good grounds for believing that something passed, both ways, between them and Shepard. Media reports to the contrary, gay-bashing is an erotic crime, not just a violent one. Most bashers, like Russell and Aaron on this evening, proposition their victim before they kill. And it is easy to see why Matthew would arouse these feelings. His very charm and generosity are seductive. Russell and Aaron could never give in to the allure of such flirtatious femininity in another man, but that doesn't mean they haven't felt it: Most men do. For Russell and Aaron it is an attraction tinged with envy. They have never been allowed to be this feminine-or even, you might say, this nice. They have never been allowed to take such pleasure in fabrics and textures as this boy is taking in his expensive clothes, but they have wanted to. Matthew's interest in them makes him infinitely more threatening; this feminine boy has made a masculine pass by offering to pay for their drinks. His wealth threatens to put them on the bottom where they have always been, but this time, in relation to a tiny, femmy boy. He tells them he is gay and they say that they're gay, too. \"Let's go back to Aaron's place,\" they say, \"and get to know each other better\" (as Aaron's girlfriend will recount on 20/20 ). Once he gets into their truck, Aaron takes out his gun and smashes the butt of it into Matthew's head. \"We're not gay, and you just got jacked,\" he yells. I'm struck by how that sentence resembles an equation: We're not gay and you just got jacked. Russell and Aaron aren't \"gay\"-here, a synonym for \"powerless\"-because Matthew just got \"jacked.\" As they beat him with the .357 Magnum and their fists, Russell laughs out loud. They take his wallet from him, further confirming their superiority. Shepard begs for his life, which only makes him more equivalent in their eyes to the piece of nothing that they want him to be. Henderson and McKinney drive him out to a prairie owned by the Warren Livestock Company, where everyone in Laramie goes to commune with nature.

The feminist movement has never been very strong here, and the incidence of rape and domestic violence against women and children is extraordinarily high. Last year, approximately one in twelve local women reported battering or sexual assault on herself or a child to Laramie's antiviolence project. That's shocking, considering that more than half of all rapes and battering cases are never reported at all. Most media coverage has attributed Shepard's murder to the supposed backwardness and endemic homophobia of rural people, inflaming the bitterness Laramieans have felt for years over the fact that the rest of the country sees them as dumb yokels. (The uneducated and poor are especially despised here because of the sense that they contribute to that image.) In fact, Laramie was the likeliest place in the state for an antigay murder to happen, not because of its backwardness but because of its progressiveness and its pockets of wealth and poverty. Explaining why gets tricky, because we are in the realm of cultural memes that bear only the slightest relation to reality. Comfort and voluptuousness (and, of course, consumerism) have been linked in the public mind with effeminacy and homosexuality for decades. Most antigay murders, in fact, aren't committed on the prairie but in liberal cities like New York and San Francisco, where the perception of gay privilege and boys' brutally inculcated fear of being feminine results in scores of antigay murders every year. The left has never been particularly eager to examine the ways that class, victimhood and violence are coded in the language of gender, but examining this could help us understand why so many boys and men of all classes between the ages of 15 and 22 are so worried about being on the bottom that they search gay-friendly neighborhoods for gay men to attack. Cultural dogma holds that men must demonstrate at every turn that they are not on the bottom, even if they actually are. Laramie, the only college town in a state where a number of people hunt for food, is obsessed with status, and Russell and Aaron were reviled for being \"losers,\" dropouts and poor. They were also addicted to crystal meth. Long ago, Russell had been an honors student and wanted badly to go to college, but instead he wound up as a roofer earning $12,000 a year. Aaron, for his part, saw himself as such a moron that when he won some money in an insurance settlement after his mother's death from a botched hysterectomy, he went out and bought an enormous necklace that displayed his nickname, \"Dopey.\" Almost no one in our society is comfortable seeing straight men as victims, certainly not the men themselves. But until they do, men like Russell and Aaron will continue to prove their nonvictim status by attacking men like Matthew. And no matter how many gay people homophobes know-like the ones Russell and Aaron knew in Russell's girlfriend's family-gay people will continue to be seen as the enemy. Picture the three of them at the Fireside, a bar downtown where university and non-university people mix. Even Aaron and Russell's friends treat them like wimps-they often put Aaron in a headlock and call him \"the shrimp\"-and tonight the Fireside's bartender is shunning them because literally they have dirty hands. And maybe also because they can't afford to tip. They don't even have the $5.50 to pay for the pitcher of beer they just drank, and they're turning their pockets inside out looking for it, annoying the bartender. It's humiliating. All their cash is in nickels and dimes. Then a beautiful boy at the end of the bar asks if he can help. McKinney and Henderson are small men, but this boy is smaller. He's the same age as they are but wearing incredibly stylish clothes, a clean shave, shiny patent leather shoes. His hair is bleached; his hands on the bar are white and flowerlike. He himself looks like an emblem of everything they have never been allowed to be. He's a child-man, or looks like one: still wearing braces, but with enough money to pay for strangers. The bartender loves him. Matthew thanks (and tips) him with a marvelous politeness after every round. Russell and Aaron barely know how to speak that way, like someone who's fluent in Arabic, French and German, who was able to be openly gay in high school (at a fabulous private school in Switzerland); like someone who's already chosen a career in international human rights. They stare at him across the bar (witnesses differ on whether they take his cash or not). Matthew is, quite probably, being flirtatious. (\"Matthew was flirty with everyone ,\" says Jason Marsden, who was a close friend.) But these two boys have faces that might be read as gay, and Henderson is actually cute. There are good grounds for believing that something passed, both ways, between them and Shepard. Media reports to the contrary, gay-bashing is an erotic crime, not just a violent one. Most bashers, like Russell and Aaron on this evening, proposition their victim before they kill. And it is easy to see why Matthew would arouse these feelings. His very charm and generosity are seductive. Russell and Aaron could never give in to the allure of such flirtatious femininity in another man, but that doesn't mean they haven't felt it: Most men do. For Russell and Aaron it is an attraction tinged with envy. They have never been allowed to be this feminine-or even, you might say, this nice. They have never been allowed to take such pleasure in fabrics and textures as this boy is taking in his expensive clothes, but they have wanted to. Matthew's interest in them makes him infinitely more threatening; this feminine boy has made a masculine pass by offering to pay for their drinks. His wealth threatens to put them on the bottom where they have always been, but this time, in relation to a tiny, femmy boy. He tells them he is gay and they say that they're gay, too. \"Let's go back to Aaron's place,\" they say, \"and get to know each other better\" (as Aaron's girlfriend will recount on 20/20 ). Once he gets into their truck, Aaron takes out his gun and smashes the butt of it into Matthew's head. \"We're not gay, and you just got jacked,\" he yells. I'm struck by how that sentence resembles an equation: We're not gay and you just got jacked. Russell and Aaron aren't \"gay\"-here, a synonym for \"powerless\"-because Matthew just got \"jacked.\" As they beat him with the .357 Magnum and their fists, Russell laughs out loud. They take his wallet from him, further confirming their superiority. Shepard begs for his life, which only makes him more equivalent in their eyes to the piece of nothing that they want him to be. Henderson and McKinney drive him out to a prairie owned by the Warren Livestock Company, where everyone in Laramie goes to commune with nature. People bike and run and walk their dogs here; and though the livestock company owns it, people act like it is everyone's. The prairie is windswept and rugged, and Russell and Aaron would have seen incredibly beautiful stars at midnight when they took him there. I think it's significant that they killed Shepard in such a beautiful place. Many people have noticed something strangely religious about this crime, and the attack looks more and more so the more you walk around the site. The fence to which they tied him is surrounded by long, flat stones that look like altar stones. And the fence itself is small, too tiny to keep out even a baby deer; it is purely symbolic, like a gold cross on a chain. It is the idea of a fence, and that's enough; they were demonstrating the idea of their election, their superiority. The press, in calling it a crucifixion, was not far off; it certainly looks like a site for holy sacrifice. While they're whaling on Shepard, they repeatedly hit him in the groin. They have to hit him in the groin: What else will finally get across the idea that they are not the victims? One thing that is perpetually underemphasized in the discussion of gay-bashings is the sense of overcoming one's disgrace and terror. Almost all the antigay murderers in Arthur Dong's documentary Licensed to Kill mention their fear of being raped or beaten up, as they were by men in the past. In a major study of gay-bashers, almost all expressed fears of being raped by the men they sought to beat. In the minds of bashers, gay-bashing means not being attacked anymore (never mind that gay people haven't hurt them). Aaron and Russell, too, have been victims their whole lives, and now they want to be the opposite. That's why they sacrifice him. Even after they force him to tell his address so that they can rob his house, even after his nose is broken and his skull is cracked, there remains a taint of victimhood on them that they cannot expunge except by leaving Shepard tied there in their stead. They even remove his shoes, out of some insane fear that he might get up and walk away. He isn't spread-eagled, like Christ on the cross, but lying on the ground tied by his wrists, like an animal offering. In that holy place, it feels like all their worthlessness has been redeemed.

Aaron, for his part, saw himself as such a moron that when he won some money in an insurance settlement after his mother's death from a botched hysterectomy, he went out and bought an enormous necklace that displayed his nickname, \"Dopey.\" Almost no one in our society is comfortable seeing straight men as victims, certainly not the men themselves. But until they do, men like Russell and Aaron will continue to prove their nonvictim status by attacking men like Matthew. And no matter how many gay people homophobes know-like the ones Russell and Aaron knew in Russell's girlfriend's family-gay people will continue to be seen as the enemy. Picture the three of them at the Fireside, a bar downtown where university and non-university people mix. Even Aaron and Russell's friends treat them like wimps-they often put Aaron in a headlock and call him \"the shrimp\"-and tonight the Fireside's bartender is shunning them because literally they have dirty hands. And maybe also because they can't afford to tip. They don't even have the $5.50 to pay for the pitcher of beer they just drank, and they're turning their pockets inside out looking for it, annoying the bartender. It's humiliating. All their cash is in nickels and dimes. Then a beautiful boy at the end of the bar asks if he can help. McKinney and Henderson are small men, but this boy is smaller. He's the same age as they are but wearing incredibly stylish clothes, a clean shave, shiny patent leather shoes. His hair is bleached; his hands on the bar are white and flowerlike. He himself looks like an emblem of everything they have never been allowed to be. He's a child-man, or looks like one: still wearing braces, but with enough money to pay for strangers. The bartender loves him. Matthew thanks (and tips) him with a marvelous politeness after every round. Russell and Aaron barely know how to speak that way, like someone who's fluent in Arabic, French and German, who was able to be openly gay in high school (at a fabulous private school in Switzerland); like someone who's already chosen a career in international human rights. They stare at him across the bar (witnesses differ on whether they take his cash or not). Matthew is, quite probably, being flirtatious. (\"Matthew was flirty with everyone ,\" says Jason Marsden, who was a close friend.) But these two boys have faces that might be read as gay, and Henderson is actually cute. There are good grounds for believing that something passed, both ways, between them and Shepard. Media reports to the contrary, gay-bashing is an erotic crime, not just a violent one. Most bashers, like Russell and Aaron on this evening, proposition their victim before they kill. And it is easy to see why Matthew would arouse these feelings. His very charm and generosity are seductive. Russell and Aaron could never give in to the allure of such flirtatious femininity in another man, but that doesn't mean they haven't felt it: Most men do. For Russell and Aaron it is an attraction tinged with envy. They have never been allowed to be this feminine-or even, you might say, this nice. They have never been allowed to take such pleasure in fabrics and textures as this boy is taking in his expensive clothes, but they have wanted to. Matthew's interest in them makes him infinitely more threatening; this feminine boy has made a masculine pass by offering to pay for their drinks. His wealth threatens to put them on the bottom where they have always been, but this time, in relation to a tiny, femmy boy. He tells them he is gay and they say that they're gay, too. \"Let's go back to Aaron's place,\" they say, \"and get to know each other better\" (as Aaron's girlfriend will recount on 20/20 ). Once he gets into their truck, Aaron takes out his gun and smashes the butt of it into Matthew's head. \"We're not gay, and you just got jacked,\" he yells. I'm struck by how that sentence resembles an equation: We're not gay and you just got jacked. Russell and Aaron aren't \"gay\"-here, a synonym for \"powerless\"-because Matthew just got \"jacked.\" As they beat him with the .357 Magnum and their fists, Russell laughs out loud. They take his wallet from him, further confirming their superiority. Shepard begs for his life, which only makes him more equivalent in their eyes to the piece of nothing that they want him to be. Henderson and McKinney drive him out to a prairie owned by the Warren Livestock Company, where everyone in Laramie goes to commune with nature. People bike and run and walk their dogs here; and though the livestock company owns it, people act like it is everyone's. The prairie is windswept and rugged, and Russell and Aaron would have seen incredibly beautiful stars at midnight when they took him there. I think it's significant that they killed Shepard in such a beautiful place. Many people have noticed something strangely religious about this crime, and the attack looks more and more so the more you walk around the site. The fence to which they tied him is surrounded by long, flat stones that look like altar stones. And the fence itself is small, too tiny to keep out even a baby deer; it is purely symbolic, like a gold cross on a chain. It is the idea of a fence, and that's enough; they were demonstrating the idea of their election, their superiority. The press, in calling it a crucifixion, was not far off; it certainly looks like a site for holy sacrifice. While they're whaling on Shepard, they repeatedly hit him in the groin. They have to hit him in the groin: What else will finally get across the idea that they are not the victims? One thing that is perpetually underemphasized in the discussion of gay-bashings is the sense of overcoming one's disgrace and terror. Almost all the antigay murderers in Arthur Dong's documentary Licensed to Kill mention their fear of being raped or beaten up, as they were by men in the past. In a major study of gay-bashers, almost all expressed fears of being raped by the men they sought to beat. In the minds of bashers, gay-bashing means not being attacked anymore (never mind that gay people haven't hurt them). Aaron and Russell, too, have been victims their whole lives, and now they want to be the opposite. That's why they sacrifice him. Even after they force him to tell his address so that they can rob his house, even after his nose is broken and his skull is cracked, there remains a taint of victimhood on them that they cannot expunge except by leaving Shepard tied there in their stead. They even remove his shoes, out of some insane fear that he might get up and walk away. He isn't spread-eagled, like Christ on the cross, but lying on the ground tied by his wrists, like an animal offering. In that holy place, it feels like all their worthlessness has been redeemed.

People bike and run and walk their dogs here; and though the livestock company owns it, people act like it is everyone's. The prairie is windswept and rugged, and Russell and Aaron would have seen incredibly beautiful stars at midnight when they took him there. I think it's significant that they killed Shepard in such a beautiful place. Many people have noticed something strangely religious about this crime, and the attack looks more and more so the more you walk around the site. The fence to which they tied him is surrounded by long, flat stones that look like altar stones. And the fence itself is small, too tiny to keep out even a baby deer; it is purely symbolic, like a gold cross on a chain. It is the idea of a fence, and that's enough; they were demonstrating the idea of their election, their superiority. The press, in calling it a crucifixion, was not far off; it certainly looks like a site for holy sacrifice. While they're whaling on Shepard, they repeatedly hit him in the groin. They have to hit him in the groin: What else will finally get across the idea that they are not the victims? One thing that is perpetually underemphasized in the discussion of gay-bashings is the sense of overcoming one's disgrace and terror. Almost all the antigay murderers in Arthur Dong's documentary Licensed to Kill mention their fear of being raped or beaten up, as they were by men in the past. In a major study of gay-bashers, almost all expressed fears of being raped by the men they sought to beat. In the minds of bashers, gay-bashing means not being attacked anymore (never mind that gay people haven't hurt them). Aaron and Russell, too, have been victims their whole lives, and now they want to be the opposite. That's why they sacrifice him. Even after they force him to tell his address so that they can rob his house, even after his nose is broken and his skull is cracked, there remains a taint of victimhood on them that they cannot expunge except by leaving Shepard tied there in their stead. They even remove his shoes, out of some insane fear that he might get up and walk away. He isn't spread-eagled, like Christ on the cross, but lying on the ground tied by his wrists, like an animal offering. In that holy place, it feels like all their worthlessness has been redeemed. Shepard's face is covered in blood.\n\nThe bartender loves him. Matthew thanks (and tips) him with a marvelous politeness after every round. Russell and Aaron barely know how to speak that way, like someone who's fluent in Arabic, French and German, who was able to be openly gay in high school (at a fabulous private school in Switzerland); like someone who's already chosen a career in international human rights. They stare at him across the bar (witnesses differ on whether they take his cash or not). Matthew is, quite probably, being flirtatious. (\"Matthew was flirty with everyone ,\" says Jason Marsden, who was a close friend.) But these two boys have faces that might be read as gay, and Henderson is actually cute. There are good grounds for believing that something passed, both ways, between them and Shepard. Media reports to the contrary, gay-bashing is an erotic crime, not just a violent one. Most bashers, like Russell and Aaron on this evening, proposition their victim before they kill. And it is easy to see why Matthew would arouse these feelings. His very charm and generosity are seductive. Russell and Aaron could never give in to the allure of such flirtatious femininity in another man, but that doesn't mean they haven't felt it: Most men do. For Russell and Aaron it is an attraction tinged with envy. They have never been allowed to be this feminine-or even, you might say, this nice. They have never been allowed to take such pleasure in fabrics and textures as this boy is taking in his expensive clothes, but they have wanted to. Matthew's interest in them makes him infinitely more threatening; this feminine boy has made a masculine pass by offering to pay for their drinks. His wealth threatens to put them on the bottom where they have always been, but this time, in relation to a tiny, femmy boy. He tells them he is gay and they say that they're gay, too. \"Let's go back to Aaron's place,\" they say, \"and get to know each other better\" (as Aaron's girlfriend will recount on 20/20 ). Once he gets into their truck, Aaron takes out his gun and smashes the butt of it into Matthew's head. \"We're not gay, and you just got jacked,\" he yells. I'm struck by how that sentence resembles an equation: We're not gay and you just got jacked. Russell and Aaron aren't \"gay\"-here, a synonym for \"powerless\"-because Matthew just got \"jacked.\" As they beat him with the .357 Magnum and their fists, Russell laughs out loud. They take his wallet from him, further confirming their superiority. Shepard begs for his life, which only makes him more equivalent in their eyes to the piece of nothing that they want him to be.

Many people have noticed something strangely religious about this crime, and the attack looks more and more so the more you walk around the site. The fence to which they tied him is surrounded by long, flat stones that look like altar stones. And the fence itself is small, too tiny to keep out even a baby deer; it is purely symbolic, like a gold cross on a chain. It is the idea of a fence, and that's enough; they were demonstrating the idea of their election, their superiority. The press, in calling it a crucifixion, was not far off; it certainly looks like a site for holy sacrifice. While they're whaling on Shepard, they repeatedly hit him in the groin. They have to hit him in the groin: What else will finally get across the idea that they are not the victims? One thing that is perpetually underemphasized in the discussion of gay-bashings is the sense of overcoming one's disgrace and terror. Almost all the antigay murderers in Arthur Dong's documentary Licensed to Kill mention their fear of being raped or beaten up, as they were by men in the past. In a major study of gay-bashers, almost all expressed fears of being raped by the men they sought to beat. In the minds of bashers, gay-bashing means not being attacked anymore (never mind that gay people haven't hurt them). Aaron and Russell, too, have been victims their whole lives, and now they want to be the opposite. That's why they sacrifice him. Even after they force him to tell his address so that they can rob his house, even after his nose is broken and his skull is cracked, there remains a taint of victimhood on them that they cannot expunge except by leaving Shepard tied there in their stead. They even remove his shoes, out of some insane fear that he might get up and walk away. He isn't spread-eagled, like Christ on the cross, but lying on the ground tied by his wrists, like an animal offering. In that holy place, it feels like all their worthlessness has been redeemed.

Activate your online access\n\nA HBO documentary series helmed by Lawrence Wright unknowingly paints a picture of a state incapable of understanding how radically it has changed since its hard-right turn.\n\nA distinguished writer sits in an East Texas diner, chatting with the director Richard Linklater: They shake hands with locals and talk about Linklater's family, the prison system, and the curious \"oppositional personality\" of radicals. Now, the writer is speaking in a museum gallery, his hands folded in his lap, explaining Texas's relationship to slavery: While images play of Black people in cotton fields, he says that the \"labor-intensive process\" created an \"investment\" in keeping slaves. Later, we see the same writer gazing at the commercial traffic flowing through the US-Mexico border, his graying eyebrows knitted in concern.\n\nThis man is Lawrence Wright, a longtime member of Texas's liberal intelligentsia who was recently designated with the role of guiding voice. Billed as the gimlet-eyed chronicler of Texas's influence, Wright translates and explains the complexities of the state for a national audience from his perch at The New Yorker . This role came to fruition with his 2018 book, God Save Texas , a semi-memoir that hopscotched through the state's history and present (from Spanish colonization and slavery to NAFTA and Donald Trump) to discern what draws people here and what gets them to stay. \"Texas is a part of almost everything in modern America,\" he writes, \"the South, the West, the Plains, Hispanic and immigrant communities, the border, the divide between rural areas and the cities-what happens here tends to disproportionately affect the rest of the nation.\" It's a big claim, but we like it that way. All politics is local, after all, but we're Texas .\n\nIn Wright's view, Texas has \"nurtured an immature political culture that has done terrible damage to the state and to the nation.\" Hard to argue with that. Ruled by Republicans since 1994, Texas has wiped away any remnants of the New Deal order, replacing it with a gutted social safety net, an expansive prison system, deepening inequality, and an ever-more-authoritarian conservatism. Riding a wave of anti-\"globalist\" populism while reaping the rewards of the international economy, the icons of Texas's hard-right turn-people like Governor Greg Abbott and Senator Ted Cruz-have grown increasingly unrecognizable to the liberals who believed that Ann Richards, the state's last Democratic governor, was a sign that the long arc of history bent toward progress. (Never mind that Richards vocally supported NAFTA and prison expansion.) The epitaph on her tombstone, which Wright visits at the end of his book, is from her 1991 inaugural address, which reads: \"Today we have a vision of Texas where opportunity knows no race, no gender, no color-a glimpse of what can happen in government if we simply open the doors and let the people in.\" Ms. Richards, I have some bad news.\n\nHow to make sense of a place so renowned for its callousness today, let alone make a home here? This isn't a question with a single answer, particularly for liberals shocked by each new right-wing transgression. Books like God Save Texas are attempts to narrativize this sense of displacement, pinpointing what sin must be atoned for-or at least understood-before reconciliation and progress can begin again. Now, with the help of HBO, Wright-in his role as producer-has passed the question to three Texan directors: the Oscar-nominated Richard Linklater, the Emmy-nominated Alex Stapleton, and the indie documentarian Iliana Sosa, each of whom unearths some of the contradictions and myths foundational to their home state and their respective hometowns. They do so with Wright's assistance; he appears on-screen with them at various times, asking questions and providing insights. The resulting three-episode docuseries, also called God Save Texas , is as wounded, inept, and passive as one might expect of the cultural representatives of an unmoored movement incapable of responding effectively to the deepening crises at the state's core.\n\nHBO originally greenlighted a project titled God Save Texas as a drama series in 2014, with the screenplay to be written by Wright based on his 2005 play Sonny's Last Shot. Wright had toyed with the script's basic shape since Richards was in office. It follows Sonny Lamb, a moderate Republican state representative who breaks with his party on questions of gay rights and campaign-finance reform. (Last year, a representative did break with her party on questions of LGBTQ+ rights-only it was a Democrat joining Republicans to limit access to trans healthcare.) Eventually, HBO fell out of love with the drama idea and fired the executive on the series, at which point Wright contemplated turning Sonny's story into a \"musical podcast.\" Thankfully, that never came to pass. Instead, he wrote a novel-call it a fantasy- Mr. Texas , published last year.\n\n\" This is what politics is really like, \" Sonny thinks to himself in the novel. \"It wasn't about doing good, it was about being less awful.\" Mr. Texas is billed as a comedy, but melancholy informs Sonny's political maneuvering. As a moderate Republican, Sonny knows that \"he would probably get primaried by one of the Nazi youth the dominionists were so capable of producing\" and that he could \"never pass for a Dem. Independents didn't exist.\" For Wright, therein lies the problem: no moderating force, no enlightened center! (For further evidence of this tendency of his, consider Wright's recent chummy contribution to an article by Joe Nocera in The Free Press , Bari Weiss's right-wing rag, where-from his vantage as a \"Pulitzer Prize-winning\" quoted source-he joins a chorus of wealthy conservatives to croak about the rise in \"lawlessness\" in Austin, apparently because police felt \"alienated\" by the protests in 2020 following George Floyd's murder.) HBO may have discarded the fictional conceit in favor of a documentary when it revived the God Save Texas title, but the series inspired by Wright's work is similarly blinkered: captured by a myth about the value of patient, incremental liberal politics that should be dead many times over by now but still lumbers on, permitting the right to determine the bounds of Texas liberalism. Indeed, for many longtime Texas liberals, politics froze in the 1990s. The rest of the world has drifted a long way since then, and it will continue to drift so long as we reach for old answers that have ceased to apply to what ails the state-and the country-today.\n\nHuntsville is a small East Texas town with seven nearby prisons and thousands of prisoners, among whom nearly 1,000 death-row inmates have been murdered. It also inspired some of Linklater's films-\"mostly comedies,\" he says somewhat shamefully. Many of his friends growing up here have either worked at a prison or spent time behind bars. Linklater excels at demonstrating the casual cruelty here, contrasting the prison town's brutality with the rural community's charm.\n\nIn one scene in Linklater's episode of the HBO series, families wait under the shade of old oak trees for their loved ones to be released. One child among them, waiting for his dad, tells Linklater: \"I haven't really been able to play football with anybody, because, like, my grandma's not really into football.\" As one might expect from the director of Boyhood , Linklater has an eye for moments like these, imbued with emotion even if sometimes his subjects can't quite find the words to express all they feel. With nearly double the running time of the other two episodes, Linklater has more expanse to let his subjects speak for themselves. We see college students walking to class while a prison siren blares, learn of inmates giving guards and their families free haircuts, and follow a corps of correction officers drawn from a growing community of African immigrants in search of stable jobs.\n\nBut when it comes time to think out loud about what changes to the prison system we in Texas might aspire to, Linklater approaches the task self-consciously. No documentary requires its makers to provide a comprehensive list of reforms, but when a solution is offered, it's worth asking where it leads and how it has informed the film's argument up to that point. We meet several prison guards, but special attention is paid to Fred Allen, who was responsible for restraining at least 130 death-row inmates for their executions-around 10 percent of all the executions in Texas. Allen reached a point where he simply couldn't keep going. \"You ain't got a right to take nobody's life, period,\" he says, but Allen still hasn't budged on the prison system as a whole. His preferred alternative to death row is life without parole, \"because that's the worst sentence that an individual can have.\"\n\nThis is the point of view Linklater adopts. \"There are sentencing options like life without parole,\" he submits, almost pleadingly, near the end of the episode. Within the structure of the documentary, the death penalty once appeared to be the cruelest part of an impossibly cruel institution. By the end, it has become the only part of the system that, at least for Linklater, could possibly be reformed-and even that isn't guaranteed. It's as if he's already tempered his proposal, certain it will be shot down anyway. Taken on their own, the documentary's images could argue beyond this rather tepid conclusion, and yet Linklater's scope appears squeamishly limited. Considering the prison-industrial complex, he tells Wright, \"I guess, on one hand, it's a blessing-it's the local economy, largely-but it is a bit of a curse.\"\n\nThis is putting it lightly. Even if we ended the death penalty tomorrow, Texas's incarceration rate would still be among the highest in the world-never mind the \"accidental\" death toll in the state's prisons. A 2014 report from the Prison Justice League, a prisoner-rights group in Austin, found that in one Huntsville-area prison, disabled prisoners suffered high rates of physical and sexual abuse inflicted by correction officers. Just last summer, at least 41 inmates in Texas died during a heat wave, including a few in Huntsville (more than two-thirds of our prisons have no air-conditioning in most living areas).\n\nWhile court-sanctioned murder may be the most outwardly abhorrent piece of our criminal-justice system here in Texas, to remove it while saying little about the many other indignities we visit disproportionately upon poor people behind bars is like smearing lipstick on a pig. History shows that the right will resist practically any \"bleeding heart\" change to the prison system (though it may be moved on fiscal grounds , provided the system itself remains intact) and is quick to roll back reforms if need be. To limit our political imagination-and thus, political will-based on the whims of the opposition is not only shortsighted but also self-defeating, and it shirks the desperate need to decide what Texas liberalism actually stands for. Is it merely tweaking the worst aspects of an abhorrent system, or something altogether different? Why isn't it possible to demand more?\n\nThis is the smothering effect of political loss after loss, which continues to constrict thinking in the series' next episode, \"The Price of Oil.\" Alex Stapleton, a biracial \"Texan in exile,\" returns to Pleasantville, a suburb of the Houston area that she grew up visiting on weekends. \"Where is the Black story in Texas,\" Stapleton asks toward the beginning, \"and where is the Black story when we talk about oil?\" She highlights how settlers mounted the Texas Revolution to keep their slaves. From there, we learn of the origin of Pleasantville: The neighborhood was built in the late 1940s for middle-income Black families, which gave residents access to the benefits of suburban living for the first time. Then, in the 1970s, the refineries expanded practically into their backyards.\n\nToday, chemical fires are common there, as are cancer, asthma, and other environmental harms. If you look at a map of toxic chemicals along the Houston Ship Channel, which is near the area in question, you'll notice a smattering of red, orange, and yellow warning signs. Stapleton is up-front about the havoc the petrochemical industry has unleashed on the Houston area. The heightened risk comes with few rewards for Pleasantville: Due to systemic racism in the oil industry and among oil-rich politicians, she says, \"my family today can continue to live in one of the wealthiest parts of the world without ever having the same opportunities.\" Nowhere is this better illustrated than in the fate of her great-aunt's home, which was damaged during Winter Storm Uri. Rather than attempt more expensive repairs, the local government provided only one option: to demolish the property and replace it with a smaller shotgun home. Meanwhile, the nearby fossil-fuel infrastructure, and the companies that run it, have remained intact.\n\nAnd yet, toward the end of the episode, Stapleton chooses an odd point of critique: \"Among the largest oil and gas companies in America, every CEO is white,\" she says. \"While other industries have been put on blast for their lack of diversity, the oil and gas industry has not had the same reckoning.\" Stapleton does add later that her community needs \"a seat at the table\" as the country \"entertains\" a green transition, but the only specific action she suggests is increasing the diversity on corporate boards.\n\nOne might say I'm taking the docuseries too literally, and my critiques of what is first and foremost a form of infotainment can't, or shouldn't, be held to the same standards as, say, an essay-but this is what's so galling about the tepid suggestions capping each episode. Consider the stakes: Supposing Chevron or ExxonMobil did face this DEI reckoning-what would actually change about the oil industry? The pollution would not stop, and even if conditions improved in Pleasantville, what about the rest of Texas, let alone the rest of the world? Standing at the base of the San Jacinto monument, which memorializes the Texas Revolution, Stapleton and Wright talk with their hands on their hips, contemplating the region's environmental situation. \"America obviously needs an energy source, and this is what it looks like,\" Wright says. \"I think the more we talk about Texas, the more complicated it seems.\"\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nComplicated, yes, but can the Bard of Texas not say more? Can infotainment, as it were, not approach these issues with some creative liberty? Instead, Wright and Stapleton bow their heads to the apparent nuance of it all, and Stapleton retreats to old ground: \"I want to document the history,\" she says, \"because that will live forever.\"\n\nIn many ways, Iliana Sosa's episode, \"La Frontera,\" is the prickliest of the three. Like Stapleton, she highlights the not-so-distant past, showing us how racist border policing has changed over time, and celebrates the community's resilience in spite of this. From the early 1900s, when people crossing over from Mexico were \"sanitized\" with Zyklon B-the same gas used in Nazi concentration camps a few decades later-Sosa shows us the plans to gentrify downtown El Paso ( helped along years ago, I should add, by then-City Councilman Beto O'Rourke). A marketing company commissioned by El Paso's city government labeled its current, largely Hispanic identity \"Old Cowboy,\" meaning \"male, 50-60 years old, gritty, dirty, [and] lazy.\" Illustrating this point was an accompanying photo of an old Hispanic man in a cowboy hat. \"That could be anybody's abuelito ,\" Sosa says. On the next slide, the company proposed marketing a new identity called \"New West\": It would be \"educated, entrepreneurial, bilingual,\" and modeled after Matthew McConaughey and Penélope Cruz, whose headshots accompany the text.\n\n\"We see so many depictions of the border, and I wanted to make sure that we were trying to do something different,\" Sosa recently told Texas Monthly . To do so, paradoxically, she draws on the well-trodden work of the influential 1980s-era Chicana scholar Gloria Anzaldúa and her concept of nepantla -an Aztec word referring to the unique space between two bodies of water-to explore identity in the El Paso/Ciudad Juarez borderlands. To say Anzaldúa's work is controversial is an understatement: In her 1987 Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza , Anzaldúa's most important book, she praises a Mexican eugenicist and uses his writings to inform her own. Still, what sets Sosa's episode apart, I think, is her honesty.\n\nShe comes to a realization near the end of the episode, at an event called Hugs Not Walls, which is hosted once a year to reunite separated families for around five minutes in the middle of the Rio Grande. The fences, surveilled heavily by the Border Patrol, are temporarily opened, and a team of volunteers installs a portable bridge. Lines form on either end, the US side in yellow, the Mexican side in blue. One by one, parents and children find each other, weep, and embrace. Watching this unfold, bitterness overtakes Sosa: \"Hugs Not Walls may offer these families a fleeting embrace, but it also feels like I'm witnessing a spectacle of human pain in lieu of any real solution,\" she says in a voice-over. That sentence rattled in my head for days after finishing these three episodes. God Save Texas , the title, is itself a plea for divine intervention, a symptom of learned helplessness, but Sosa's pronouncement may as well be the show's tagline.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

Ever since Donald Trump's election, Schumer has faced growing anger from progressive Democrats infuriated by his stated willingness to work with a man they consider unfit for public office. A local group had been working for nearly a year to convince Schumer to answer questions from constituents in person. Organizers were expecting more than 1,200 people to show up; a full 90 minutes before the event was scheduled to begin, the hall was about a sixth full. In the crowd was Arlene Geiger, a New Yorker since 1969, who came wearing a T-shirt with giant block letters saying, \"LEAD the Dems on SCOTUS.\" She told me she worked as the coordinator of the Upper West Side Move On/Indivisible action group , a progressive coalition. What did she think of Schumer's July 2 op-ed warning readers what was at stake in light of Justice Kennedy's retirement and the upcoming Supreme Court vacancy? \"Schumer not voting to confirm Trump's nominee is no great accomplishment,\" Geiger said. \"That's a no-brainer. We don't need him to just vote 'no,' we need him to make sure all the Dems vote no.\" At 5:03 pm , everyone who registered for the event online received an e-mail message. \"We sincerely regret to inform you that-due to mechanical issues that have grounded his plane in upstate New York-Senator Schumer is unable to make it to New York City and must CANCEL tonight's town hall meeting,\" it read. But people were still arriving. And as word began to filter through the assembly that the senator was a no-show-and had offered to host a \"tele-town hall\" in the same time slot instead-an angry buzz filled the room. \"He should get off his ass,\" crowed a man with a thick New York accent who asked to be identified only as Vincent. \"I don't believe he has mechanical difficulties; I think he doesn't have the balls to show up and face us.\" (\"Can you write 'testicular fortitude' instead of 'balls'?\" Vincent later asked.) \"The man is either a coward or he's incompetent,\" another man complained. \"Does he want to do this? Does he want to be Joe Crowley [the 10-term congressman recently defeated by newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]? He can't show up in his own district, his own synagogue?\" asked Miriam Clark, a longtime constituent of Schumer's.

An older white man in a Hawaiian shirt and an eyepatch began angrily berating a young black man named Garrett. Garrett, a Schumer staffer who did not provide his last name and whom Schumer's office would not immediately identify, was tasked with breaking the news that his boss was a no-show. He looked positively miserable. Schumer's staff, said the man with the eyepatch, never should have sent their boss upstate when they knew he had a town-hall meeting to attend later that day in Brooklyn. Also, a tele- town hall is a poor substitute for the real thing. \"There's no Internet in here,\" complained the man with the eyepatch. \"You don't need the Internet to join the tele-town hall,\" said Garrett . \" You can call in on your phone.\" \"I'm deaf ,\" countered the guy with the eyepatch. \"I'm sorry to hear that,\" Garrett responded, sweating in his suit in the 90-degree heat. There was no air-conditioning in the sanctuary building. When Garrett explained to another man that he had no way of arranging for the tele-town hall to be broadcast from the synagogue so that everyone could participate simultaneously, the man snapped at him. \"We'll take over from here, thanks,\" he said. \"Because you people are useless.\" Then, as if by magic, one of the women from Indivisible produced a cardboard cutout of Schumer and placed it on the bimah, the podium in a synagogue from which the Torah is read. People gathered around, snapping cell-phone pictures of the women posing with Cardboard Chuck. One woman whispered to another, \"We've got to get Chuck off of there; the CBE folks aren't comfortable with photos being taken of him on the bimah.\" After a minor scuffle, Cardboard Chuck was moved in front of the bimah. Olenick stood up and introduced herself. \"We have some messages for Chuck Schumer, so we are going to deliver those messages,\" she announced, to cheers and applause. \"We are going to commandeer this town hall.\" She gestured angrily at Cardboard Chuck. \"With everything that's happening in this country, we need people to show up and we need to hear from Chuck Schumer in person . Our first demand is that he needs to reschedule this town hall immediately. Almost a full year's worth of work went into getting him to hold this town hall in the first place. We are not going to let him phone this in.\" The crowd roared, and Olenick led them in several chants: \"Reschedule, Chuck!\" and \"Don't phone it in!\" A young Hispanic man introduced as Angel from National Indivisible got up to speak next. \"New York is one of the strongest places in the country,\" he said. \"The most important thing your senator needs to be is responsible for you and your needs. What was not written in Schumer's New York Times op-ed was whether or not he's willing to whip on this vote.... He did not whip the vote on [CIA director] Gina Haspel, someone who tortured people.\" Angel led another chant: \"Whip the vote! Whip the vote!\" Schumer's no-show was turning into a rally. A black woman named Sherese Jackson rose. She was with Indivisible Nation BK. \"As the leader of the Democrats,\" she said, addressing Cardboard Chuck, \"Explain why you aren't doing more to support women, particularly black women, who are running for or in Congress. We are the backbone of the Democratic Party and we have been instrumental in winning districts in Alabama, Virginia.... Ninety-four percent of us voted for Hillary Clinton. How are you mobilizing and reaching out to Democratic voters? Will you commit to fundraising and supporting non-establishment women in their upcoming elections?\" Jackson, too, was met with cheers and applause. Then a young woman with curly hair stood up. \"I'm Claire Nuchtern,\" she said, \"I'm Jewish, and we are in a Jewish space. I know that you, Chuck Schumer, are also proud of your Jewish values. Tell me, how does the imprisonment of Palestinian children in Israel and Central American children in the United States meet your Jewish values? To be clear, your silence is not civil.\" The applause for Nuchtern was deafening. Sonni Mun, an activist with Moms Demand Action, a pro-gun control group, introduced herself next. \"What are we going to do to get action on guns?\" she asked in an anguished tone. \"They are winning the publicity wars. We are losing the message war. I don't want to see Trump supporters on every talk show. I want to see progressives and liberals flood the airwaves. His policies do not support average Americans. If he is becoming more popular, it's not because he's doing a better job, it's because of publicity.\" \"Moms Demand Chuck Schumer!\" the Moms Demand Action women hollered. Gradually, the impromptu rally dispersed. Most people went home or to a coffeeshop to dial into Schumer's tele-town hall. After a lengthy, anodyne introduction from New York City Council member Brad Lander, Schumer spent half the call telling the story of how he got into politics. It involved: mediocre basketball skills, perfect SAT scores, and the fact that he went to Harvard. \"We can't always change Trump's policies,\" said Schumer at one point, failing to read the tele-room, not least because he couldn't actually see any of the tele-townspeople, \"but we can shine a light on them.\" \"We're on the same team; we have the same goals,\" he pleaded as his virtual town-hall meeting-marked by questions like, to paraphrase, \"How can you be such a hypocrite?\" and \"Why are you such a coward compared to Mitch McConnell?\"-limped to a painful close. In the coming days, Schumer's \"team\" will flood his office with angry phone calls. And yet again, they will demand that he appear in Brooklyn to face their wrath in person.\n\nOrganizers were expecting more than 1,200 people to show up; a full 90 minutes before the event was scheduled to begin, the hall was about a sixth full. In the crowd was Arlene Geiger, a New Yorker since 1969, who came wearing a T-shirt with giant block letters saying, \"LEAD the Dems on SCOTUS.\" She told me she worked as the coordinator of the Upper West Side Move On/Indivisible action group , a progressive coalition. What did she think of Schumer's July 2 op-ed warning readers what was at stake in light of Justice Kennedy's retirement and the upcoming Supreme Court vacancy? \"Schumer not voting to confirm Trump's nominee is no great accomplishment,\" Geiger said. \"That's a no-brainer. We don't need him to just vote 'no,' we need him to make sure all the Dems vote no.\" At 5:03 pm , everyone who registered for the event online received an e-mail message. \"We sincerely regret to inform you that-due to mechanical issues that have grounded his plane in upstate New York-Senator Schumer is unable to make it to New York City and must CANCEL tonight's town hall meeting,\" it read. But people were still arriving. And as word began to filter through the assembly that the senator was a no-show-and had offered to host a \"tele-town hall\" in the same time slot instead-an angry buzz filled the room. \"He should get off his ass,\" crowed a man with a thick New York accent who asked to be identified only as Vincent. \"I don't believe he has mechanical difficulties; I think he doesn't have the balls to show up and face us.\" (\"Can you write 'testicular fortitude' instead of 'balls'?\" Vincent later asked.) \"The man is either a coward or he's incompetent,\" another man complained. \"Does he want to do this? Does he want to be Joe Crowley [the 10-term congressman recently defeated by newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]? He can't show up in his own district, his own synagogue?\" asked Miriam Clark, a longtime constituent of Schumer's.

An older white man in a Hawaiian shirt and an eyepatch began angrily berating a young black man named Garrett. Garrett, a Schumer staffer who did not provide his last name and whom Schumer's office would not immediately identify, was tasked with breaking the news that his boss was a no-show. He looked positively miserable. Schumer's staff, said the man with the eyepatch, never should have sent their boss upstate when they knew he had a town-hall meeting to attend later that day in Brooklyn. Also, a tele- town hall is a poor substitute for the real thing. \"There's no Internet in here,\" complained the man with the eyepatch. \"You don't need the Internet to join the tele-town hall,\" said Garrett . \" You can call in on your phone.\" \"I'm deaf ,\" countered the guy with the eyepatch. \"I'm sorry to hear that,\" Garrett responded, sweating in his suit in the 90-degree heat. There was no air-conditioning in the sanctuary building. When Garrett explained to another man that he had no way of arranging for the tele-town hall to be broadcast from the synagogue so that everyone could participate simultaneously, the man snapped at him. \"We'll take over from here, thanks,\" he said. \"Because you people are useless.\" Then, as if by magic, one of the women from Indivisible produced a cardboard cutout of Schumer and placed it on the bimah, the podium in a synagogue from which the Torah is read. People gathered around, snapping cell-phone pictures of the women posing with Cardboard Chuck. One woman whispered to another, \"We've got to get Chuck off of there; the CBE folks aren't comfortable with photos being taken of him on the bimah.\" After a minor scuffle, Cardboard Chuck was moved in front of the bimah. Olenick stood up and introduced herself. \"We have some messages for Chuck Schumer, so we are going to deliver those messages,\" she announced, to cheers and applause. \"We are going to commandeer this town hall.\" She gestured angrily at Cardboard Chuck. \"With everything that's happening in this country, we need people to show up and we need to hear from Chuck Schumer in person . Our first demand is that he needs to reschedule this town hall immediately. Almost a full year's worth of work went into getting him to hold this town hall in the first place.

We are not going to let him phone this in.\" The crowd roared, and Olenick led them in several chants: \"Reschedule, Chuck!\" and \"Don't phone it in!\" A young Hispanic man introduced as Angel from National Indivisible got up to speak next. \"New York is one of the strongest places in the country,\" he said. \"The most important thing your senator needs to be is responsible for you and your needs. What was not written in Schumer's New York Times op-ed was whether or not he's willing to whip on this vote.... He did not whip the vote on [CIA director] Gina Haspel, someone who tortured people.\" Angel led another chant: \"Whip the vote! Whip the vote!\" Schumer's no-show was turning into a rally. A black woman named Sherese Jackson rose. She was with Indivisible Nation BK. \"As the leader of the Democrats,\" she said, addressing Cardboard Chuck, \"Explain why you aren't doing more to support women, particularly black women, who are running for or in Congress. We are the backbone of the Democratic Party and we have been instrumental in winning districts in Alabama, Virginia.... Ninety-four percent of us voted for Hillary Clinton. How are you mobilizing and reaching out to Democratic voters? Will you commit to fundraising and supporting non-establishment women in their upcoming elections?\" Jackson, too, was met with cheers and applause. Then a young woman with curly hair stood up. \"I'm Claire Nuchtern,\" she said, \"I'm Jewish, and we are in a Jewish space. I know that you, Chuck Schumer, are also proud of your Jewish values. Tell me, how does the imprisonment of Palestinian children in Israel and Central American children in the United States meet your Jewish values? To be clear, your silence is not civil.\" The applause for Nuchtern was deafening. Sonni Mun, an activist with Moms Demand Action, a pro-gun control group, introduced herself next. \"What are we going to do to get action on guns?\" she asked in an anguished tone. \"They are winning the publicity wars. We are losing the message war. I don't want to see Trump supporters on every talk show. I want to see progressives and liberals flood the airwaves. His policies do not support average Americans. If he is becoming more popular, it's not because he's doing a better job, it's because of publicity.\" \"Moms Demand Chuck Schumer!\" the Moms Demand Action women hollered. Gradually, the impromptu rally dispersed. Most people went home or to a coffeeshop to dial into Schumer's tele-town hall. After a lengthy, anodyne introduction from New York City Council member Brad Lander, Schumer spent half the call telling the story of how he got into politics. It involved: mediocre basketball skills, perfect SAT scores, and the fact that he went to Harvard. \"We can't always change Trump's policies,\" said Schumer at one point, failing to read the tele-room, not least because he couldn't actually see any of the tele-townspeople, \"but we can shine a light on them.\" \"We're on the same team; we have the same goals,\" he pleaded as his virtual town-hall meeting-marked by questions like, to paraphrase, \"How can you be such a hypocrite?\" and \"Why are you such a coward compared to Mitch McConnell?\"-limped to a painful close. In the coming days, Schumer's \"team\" will flood his office with angry phone calls. And yet again, they will demand that he appear in Brooklyn to face their wrath in person.\n\n\"The man is either a coward or he's incompetent,\" another man complained. \"Does he want to do this? Does he want to be Joe Crowley [the 10-term congressman recently defeated by newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]? He can't show up in his own district, his own synagogue?\" asked Miriam Clark, a longtime constituent of Schumer's.

An older white man in a Hawaiian shirt and an eyepatch began angrily berating a young black man named Garrett. Garrett, a Schumer staffer who did not provide his last name and whom Schumer's office would not immediately identify, was tasked with breaking the news that his boss was a no-show. He looked positively miserable. Schumer's staff, said the man with the eyepatch, never should have sent their boss upstate when they knew he had a town-hall meeting to attend later that day in Brooklyn. Also, a tele- town hall is a poor substitute for the real thing. \"There's no Internet in here,\" complained the man with the eyepatch. \"You don't need the Internet to join the tele-town hall,\" said Garrett . \" You can call in on your phone.\" \"I'm deaf ,\" countered the guy with the eyepatch. \"I'm sorry to hear that,\" Garrett responded, sweating in his suit in the 90-degree heat. There was no air-conditioning in the sanctuary building. When Garrett explained to another man that he had no way of arranging for the tele-town hall to be broadcast from the synagogue so that everyone could participate simultaneously, the man snapped at him. \"We'll take over from here, thanks,\" he said. \"Because you people are useless.\" Then, as if by magic, one of the women from Indivisible produced a cardboard cutout of Schumer and placed it on the bimah, the podium in a synagogue from which the Torah is read. People gathered around, snapping cell-phone pictures of the women posing with Cardboard Chuck. One woman whispered to another, \"We've got to get Chuck off of there; the CBE folks aren't comfortable with photos being taken of him on the bimah.\" After a minor scuffle, Cardboard Chuck was moved in front of the bimah.

Olenick stood up and introduced herself. \"We have some messages for Chuck Schumer, so we are going to deliver those messages,\" she announced, to cheers and applause. \"We are going to commandeer this town hall.\" She gestured angrily at Cardboard Chuck. \"With everything that's happening in this country, we need people to show up and we need to hear from Chuck Schumer in person . Our first demand is that he needs to reschedule this town hall immediately. Almost a full year's worth of work went into getting him to hold this town hall in the first place. We are not going to let him phone this in.\" The crowd roared, and Olenick led them in several chants: \"Reschedule, Chuck!\" and \"Don't phone it in!\" A young Hispanic man introduced as Angel from National Indivisible got up to speak next. \"New York is one of the strongest places in the country,\" he said. \"The most important thing your senator needs to be is responsible for you and your needs. What was not written in Schumer's New York Times op-ed was whether or not he's willing to whip on this vote.... He did not whip the vote on [CIA director] Gina Haspel, someone who tortured people.\" Angel led another chant: \"Whip the vote! Whip the vote!\" Schumer's no-show was turning into a rally. A black woman named Sherese Jackson rose. She was with Indivisible Nation BK. \"As the leader of the Democrats,\" she said, addressing Cardboard Chuck, \"Explain why you aren't doing more to support women, particularly black women, who are running for or in Congress. We are the backbone of the Democratic Party and we have been instrumental in winning districts in Alabama, Virginia.... Ninety-four percent of us voted for Hillary Clinton. How are you mobilizing and reaching out to Democratic voters? Will you commit to fundraising and supporting non-establishment women in their upcoming elections?\" Jackson, too, was met with cheers and applause. Then a young woman with curly hair stood up. \"I'm Claire Nuchtern,\" she said, \"I'm Jewish, and we are in a Jewish space. I know that you, Chuck Schumer, are also proud of your Jewish values. Tell me, how does the imprisonment of Palestinian children in Israel and Central American children in the United States meet your Jewish values? To be clear, your silence is not civil.\" The applause for Nuchtern was deafening. Sonni Mun, an activist with Moms Demand Action, a pro-gun control group, introduced herself next. \"What are we going to do to get action on guns?\" she asked in an anguished tone. \"They are winning the publicity wars. We are losing the message war. I don't want to see Trump supporters on every talk show. I want to see progressives and liberals flood the airwaves. His policies do not support average Americans. If he is becoming more popular, it's not because he's doing a better job, it's because of publicity.\" \"Moms Demand Chuck Schumer!\" the Moms Demand Action women hollered. Gradually, the impromptu rally dispersed. Most people went home or to a coffeeshop to dial into Schumer's tele-town hall. After a lengthy, anodyne introduction from New York City Council member Brad Lander, Schumer spent half the call telling the story of how he got into politics. It involved: mediocre basketball skills, perfect SAT scores, and the fact that he went to Harvard. \"We can't always change Trump's policies,\" said Schumer at one point, failing to read the tele-room, not least because he couldn't actually see any of the tele-townspeople, \"but we can shine a light on them.\" \"We're on the same team; we have the same goals,\" he pleaded as his virtual town-hall meeting-marked by questions like, to paraphrase, \"How can you be such a hypocrite?\" and \"Why are you such a coward compared to Mitch McConnell?\"-limped to a painful close. In the coming days, Schumer's \"team\" will flood his office with angry phone calls. And yet again, they will demand that he appear in Brooklyn to face their wrath in person.\n\nSchumer's staff, said the man with the eyepatch, never should have sent their boss upstate when they knew he had a town-hall meeting to attend later that day in Brooklyn. Also, a tele- town hall is a poor substitute for the real thing. \"There's no Internet in here,\" complained the man with the eyepatch. \"You don't need the Internet to join the tele-town hall,\" said Garrett . \" You can call in on your phone.\" \"I'm deaf ,\" countered the guy with the eyepatch. \"I'm sorry to hear that,\" Garrett responded, sweating in his suit in the 90-degree heat. There was no air-conditioning in the sanctuary building. When Garrett explained to another man that he had no way of arranging for the tele-town hall to be broadcast from the synagogue so that everyone could participate simultaneously, the man snapped at him. \"We'll take over from here, thanks,\" he said. \"Because you people are useless.\" Then, as if by magic, one of the women from Indivisible produced a cardboard cutout of Schumer and placed it on the bimah, the podium in a synagogue from which the Torah is read.

It involved: mediocre basketball skills, perfect SAT scores, and the fact that he went to Harvard. \"We can't always change Trump's policies,\" said Schumer at one point, failing to read the tele-room, not least because he couldn't actually see any of the tele-townspeople, \"but we can shine a light on them.\" \"We're on the same team; we have the same goals,\" he pleaded as his virtual town-hall meeting-marked by questions like, to paraphrase, \"How can you be such a hypocrite?\" and \"Why are you such a coward compared to Mitch McConnell?\"-limped to a painful close. In the coming days, Schumer's \"team\" will flood his office with angry phone calls. And yet again, they will demand that he appear in Brooklyn to face their wrath in person.\n\nWhen Garrett explained to another man that he had no way of arranging for the tele-town hall to be broadcast from the synagogue so that everyone could participate simultaneously, the man snapped at him. \"We'll take over from here, thanks,\" he said. \"Because you people are useless.\" Then, as if by magic, one of the women from Indivisible produced a cardboard cutout of Schumer and placed it on the bimah, the podium in a synagogue from which the Torah is read. People gathered around, snapping cell-phone pictures of the women posing with Cardboard Chuck. One woman whispered to another, \"We've got to get Chuck off of there; the CBE folks aren't comfortable with photos being taken of him on the bimah.\" After a minor scuffle, Cardboard Chuck was moved in front of the bimah. Olenick stood up and introduced herself. \"We have some messages for Chuck Schumer, so we are going to deliver those messages,\" she announced, to cheers and applause. \"We are going to commandeer this town hall.\" She gestured angrily at Cardboard Chuck. \"With everything that's happening in this country, we need people to show up and we need to hear from Chuck Schumer in person . Our first demand is that he needs to reschedule this town hall immediately. Almost a full year's worth of work went into getting him to hold this town hall in the first place. We are not going to let him phone this in.\" The crowd roared, and Olenick led them in several chants: \"Reschedule, Chuck!\" and \"Don't phone it in!\" A young Hispanic man introduced as Angel from National Indivisible got up to speak next. \"New York is one of the strongest places in the country,\" he said. \"The most important thing your senator needs to be is responsible for you and your needs. What was not written in Schumer's New York Times op-ed was whether or not he's willing to whip on this vote.... He did not whip the vote on [CIA director] Gina Haspel, someone who tortured people.\" Angel led another chant: \"Whip the vote! Whip the vote!\" Schumer's no-show was turning into a rally. A black woman named Sherese Jackson rose. She was with Indivisible Nation BK. \"As the leader of the Democrats,\" she said, addressing Cardboard Chuck, \"Explain why you aren't doing more to support women, particularly black women, who are running for or in Congress. We are the backbone of the Democratic Party and we have been instrumental in winning districts in Alabama, Virginia.... Ninety-four percent of us voted for Hillary Clinton. How are you mobilizing and reaching out to Democratic voters? Will you commit to fundraising and supporting non-establishment women in their upcoming elections?\" Jackson, too, was met with cheers and applause. Then a young woman with curly hair stood up. \"I'm Claire Nuchtern,\" she said, \"I'm Jewish, and we are in a Jewish space. I know that you, Chuck Schumer, are also proud of your Jewish values. Tell me, how does the imprisonment of Palestinian children in Israel and Central American children in the United States meet your Jewish values? To be clear, your silence is not civil.\" The applause for Nuchtern was deafening. Sonni Mun, an activist with Moms Demand Action, a pro-gun control group, introduced herself next. \"What are we going to do to get action on guns?\" she asked in an anguished tone. \"They are winning the publicity wars. We are losing the message war. I don't want to see Trump supporters on every talk show. I want to see progressives and liberals flood the airwaves. His policies do not support average Americans.

      "text": "Bias Suit a Test of Resolve for Hispanic Man\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nBy A. G. Sulzberger\n\nNEW HAVEN  The two dozen firefighters who packed into Humphrey's East Restaurant were celebrating a coming marriage, drinking and jawboning in the boisterous style of large men with risky jobs, but Lt. Ben Vargas spent the evening trying to escape the tension surrounding his presence.\n\nDuring a trip to the bathroom, he found himself facing another man. Without warning, the first punch landed. When Lieutenant Vargas awoke, bloodied and splayed on the grimy floor, he was taken to the hospital.\n\nLieutenant Vargas believes the attack, five years ago, was orchestrated by a black firefighter in retaliation for his having joined a racial discrimination lawsuit against the city over its tossing out of an exam for promotion that few minority firefighters passed. (No arrests were made in the attack, and the black firefighter vigorously denies having been involved.)\n\nWhen the Hispanic firefighters' association and its members  including Lieutenant Vargas's brother  refused to publicly stand behind him, he quit the organization.\n\nLieutenant Vargas, who posted the sixth-highest score on the exam, was ridiculed as a token, a turncoat and an Uncle Tom  all of which, he said, \"made my resolve that much stronger.\"\n\nWhen the United States Supreme Court ruled this week in the firefighters' favor, Lieutenant Vargas, 40, the son of Puerto Rican parents, found himself celebrating amid an awkward racial dynamic: As the lone Hispanic among the 18 plaintiffs who had challenged an affirmative action policy, he had also challenged an appeals court decision joined by Judge Sonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic nominee to the Supreme Court.\n\n\"She's from Puerto Rico, and I'm from Puerto Rico,\" he said. \"She obviously feels differently than I do.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's 5-to-4 decision is expected to have repercussions on employment discrimination law that go well beyond fire departments, where minority groups have been woefully underrepresented, particularly in leadership positions. On the steps of the federal courthouse in New Haven on Monday, a lawyer for the firefighters, Karen Lee Torre, said they had \"become a symbol for millions of Americans who have grown tired of seeing individual achievement and merit take a back seat to race and ethnicity.\"\n\nFor Lieutenant Vargas, the ruling will probably mean a long-awaited promotion to captain in a 350-member department that he has admired since childhood but that has been plagued for decades by racial tension and recriminations.\n\n\"I consider myself an American  I was born and raised here,\" he said in an interview on the porch of his home in the wooded suburb of Wallingford. \"I love my people. I love my culture. I love our rice and beans, our salsa music, our language  everything my parents raised us with. But I am so grateful for the opportunity only the United States can give.\"\n\nHe grew up in the troubled Fair Haven neighborhood of New Haven, a complicated city known for Yale University but also for urban decay, high crime rates and failed prospects, roots he sees as similar to Judge Sotomayor's in a Bronx public housing project.\n\nHis father was a factory worker, and his mother took care of the couple's three children. (In addition to his brother, David, who did not respond to interview requests, he has a sister who now lives in Puerto Rico.) The family spoke Spanish at home, making his adjustment to school \"traumatic,\" he said.\n\nLieutenant Vargas decided to follow the path of an older friend, John Marquez, whom he looked up to. Mr. Marquez had worked his way out of the neighborhood by joining the Fire Department.\n\n\"I used to tell him, 'You know where I came from  if I can make it, anyone can,' \" Mr. Marquez, now a deputy chief in the department, said in an interview. \" 'But don't expect anything to be handed to you. Work for it.' \"\n\nBut Lieutenant Vargas's aspirations were stymied by a 1988 lawsuit, filed by black firefighters, that shut down hiring for years. The lawsuit challenged a written test that relatively few nonwhites passed. In 1994, the city agreed to disregard the test, over union complaints, and hire 40 firefighters  20 white, 10 black and 10 Hispanic, according to The New Haven Register.\n\nLieutenant Vargas was among those hired. That later led some people to criticize him as trying to shut the door that welcomed him, though he maintained that it was impossible to know how he would have done under the old hiring process.\n\nHe was promoted to lieutenant in 2000, and he now leads a four-person crew at a red-brick single-engine firehouse not far from where he grew up. He also works part time as a consultant for a company that sells equipment for firefighters.\n\n\"When I leave the firehouse, I bring it home with me,\" he said. \"I read about it. Think about it. I love this job. I don't think there's anything else I could do better.\"\n\nIn 2003, Lieutenant Vargas was one of 56 people in the department who passed a test for promotion; 15 were black or Hispanic. When city officials discovered that only two of those were likely to be immediately promoted, they decided to throw out the test, citing concerns that minority candidates might again sue, alleging discrimination.\n\nInstead, a group of white firefighters sued. The results had been posted by race, without names, and when Lieutenant Vargas learned that a Hispanic firefighter had scored sixth among 41 lieutenants on the test to become a captain, he joined the suit. Only later did he discover that the score was his.\n\n\"I would have carried the load all by myself,\" he said of filing the suit. \"Luckily there were enough people out there who felt like I did that we could stand together.\"\n\nBut Lieutenant Vargas bore more than his share of the criticism, said Lt. Matthew Marcarelli, who was among the plaintiffs and has known Lieutenant Vargas since they were classmates at the fire academy. \"Why the other guys viewed him as a turncoat I really don't understand. He did it because he's principled and he thought it was the right thing to do. Benny's nobody's token.\"\n\nChief Marquez said his old protégé was \"an easy target because he didn't fall in line.\"\n\n\"It seems that if you're not the right type of minority, you get hammered,\" he said.\n\nThe president of the black firefighters' group in New Haven did not return calls seeking comment.\n\nDespite the ugly episode at Humphrey's East shortly after the lawsuit was filed, Lieutenant Vargas said that little tension remained in the department, and that he was hopeful that the court decision would end the rest.\n\nHe noted that the Hispanic firefighters' association reversed course in February, after the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, and publicly endorsed his position.\n\nGesturing toward his three young sons, Lieutenant Vargas explained why he had no regrets. \"I want them to have a fair shake, to get a job on their merits and not because they're Hispanic or they fill a quota,\" he said. \"What a lousy way to live.\"\n\nAdvertisement"

A cellphone video showed Mr. Zambrano-Montes running through a busy intersection before turning to face officers and being shot multiple times. He had been throwing rocks when the officers tried to stop him.\n\nThe county attorney, Shawn Sant, said that the actions of the officers - Adrian Alaniz, Ryan Flanagan and Adam Wright - would not meet the state's standard for a crime. The officers had every reason to believe Mr. Zambrano posed a threat, Mr. Sant said.\n\n\"In this case, there is no evidence that the officers did not act in good faith,\" he said, \"and certainly there is no evidence of malice.\"\n\nAfter the announcement, an exchange broke out between Mr. Sant and residents, who shouted questions. \"How can this be justice?\" a woman asked. \"Drugs, mental health, 17 shots,\" she added, \"it's not the way to take someone and consider that justice.\"\n\nDocuments released after his death found that Mr. Zambrano-Montes was high on methamphetamines .\n\nHis family told investigators that he had a history of depression, suicide attempts and run-ins with the police. The documents also found that a rock with Mr. Zambrano's DNA was near his body.\n\nA lawyer for the parents of Mr. Zambrano-Montes said the family was devastated by the decision. \"His mother broke down. This was their child,\" the lawyer, Jose Baez, said. \"They put their faith in the U.S. justice system.\"\n\nThe officers were not interviewed until several weeks after the altercation, Mr. Baez said, and the prosecutor used the interviews to make his decision. \"This allowed them plenty of time to not only lawyer up but to compare notes and make sure their statements were consistent,\" he said. \"Your average citizen is not given that much of an opportunity.\"\n\nA lawyer for the former wife of Mr. Zambrano-Montes has filed a lawsuit against the city of Pasco, as well as the police department and the officers. Mr. Baez said he also planned a lawsuit.\n\nAdvertisement"

He faces up to 35 years in prison and $105,000 in fines.\n\nAccording to charging documents, the episode began on Friday night when Mr. Blackwell yelled at Mahud Villalaz, 42, for parking too close to a bus stop, saying, \"Why did you invade my country\" and \"Why don't you respect my laws?\"\n\nMr. Villalaz moved his truck and walked toward the restaurant's entrance, prosecutors say, but Mr. Blackwell continued to berate him, calling him an \"illegal\" before splashing him in the face with a bottle of acid. A surveillance camera caught the attack on video .\n\nMr. Villalaz received second-degree burns on his face and third-degree burns on his neck, as well as irritation to his left eye.\n\nWisconsin state law allows an additional fine of $5,000 and a maximum of five more years in jail for felonies in which the perpetrator selects a victim based on national origin, \"whether or not the actor's belief or perception was correct.\" Mr. Villalaz, who was born in Peru, became a United States citizen in 2013.\n\nA search of Mr. Blackwell's home recovered muriatic acid, four bottles of sulfuric acid and two bottles of lye-based drain opener, the police said.\n\nIn an interview this week, Mr. Villalaz said he had stopped after work to get carne asada and carnitas tacos at La Sierrita, in a majority-Hispanic neighborhood south of downtown Milwaukee, when he was attacked. \"I don't know the guy, and he did that to me\" Mr. Villalaz said. \"Who carries a bottle of acid?\"\n\nAdvertisement"

Rangel almost never does is identify himself as a Hispanic man, even though he is half Puerto Rican - a fact that could benefit him politically as he seeks re-election in a Congressional district that, as a result of redistricting, now for the first time has a Latino majority.\n\nEven with his closest confidants, Mr. Rangel never brings up that part of his heritage.\n\nThe reason, it seems, is that Mr. Rangel hated his Puerto Rico-born father, who, he said, hit his mother and left the family.\n\n\"When he abandoned my mom as a kid, that ended it as far as the relationship,\" he told reporters on Tuesday. \"It's a painful relationship, and I don't talk about it because I've never had any experiences there.\"\n\nMr. Rangel wrote a bit about his father in an autobiography, saying, \"My father was absolutely no good.\" But in a brief interview recently, Mr. Rangel said he was reluctant even to speak about his father; on Tuesday, approached after a news conference, he said, \"I'd rather not talk about those things.\" He said that he had attended his father's funeral, but that \"the whole thing was, was for my mother, had very little to do with me.\"\n\nAs for whether having a Puerto Rican father played some role in his identity, the congressman, now 81, noted in the interview that he was very young when his father left the family, so he \"never really enjoyed any of the cultural riches of a Puerto Rican background.\" And on Tuesday, he said that if he had had a better relationship with his father, \"I would be hablamos con ustedes en Español, no en el Inglés .\"\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Tucson Citizen\n\nSupported by\n\nBy Simon Romero\n\nTUCSON, Ariz. - The heat in the Sonoran Desert neared 100 degrees on the day several years ago when Border Patrol agents at a checkpoint pulled over an elderly Hispanic man, dressed impeccably in a tailored suit.\n\nThey ordered him out of his vehicle and requested his identity papers, which showed that he was a Mexican-born immigrant named Raúl H.

      "text": "Guy's Guy\n\nIn Derek Cianfrance's films, men get punched by men and scorned by women, but they hurt women only inadvertently. With \"Blue Valentine\" and \"The Place Beyond the Pines,\" which opens this month, the director says that he's exploring \"a new American male persona\"-one with the body of Ryan Gosling and the values of Derek Cianfrance. Or, perhaps, vice versa.\n\nAt Smooch, an organic café near Cianfrance's house in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, the thirty-nine-year-old filmmaker scrunched in his chair with his nose up, tackling questions with discursive candor. This encouraged the kind of atmosphere he strives for on set, where he tells the actors to junk the script and discover the movie for themselves. As he explained, \"It's the opposite approach to that of a James Cameron, whose job is to hammer his vision into the world-the director as God.\" He's more the director as Salvation Army store. In \"Blue Valentine\" (2010), a meditation on how love drives Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams apart, Gosling adopted Cianfrance's look-his beard and his receding hairline-for the film's check-in on the couple's foundering marriage, six years after the joyous scenes of their courtship. \"Compromising his attractiveness like that affected Ryan's confidence, and that fit who his character was-the guy who wins a fight, then exits in defeat.\"\n\nAfter a barista brought him a soy cappuccino, Cianfrance observed, \"She wrote a note on her hand that says 'Quit smoking.' \" Cianfrance, a sometime smoker, has also turned his body into a to-do list. He got \"a-m-i-g-o\" tattooed across the knuckles of his right hand, a decade ago, as a reminder of the night he was in a parking lot, changing camera tapes, and a Hispanic man with an oozing stomach wound asked for help, saying, \"Hey, amigo?\" Cianfrance thrust some pocket change at him. Then, on second thought, he turned back to offer actual help, but the man had disappeared among the cars. Farther up the director's right arm is a blue oak leaf, a symbol of patience that he vowed to stamp on himself if \"Blue Valentine\" was ever made. When he finally got the green light, after twelve years, he no longer wanted the blue leaf, but the new American male keeps his promises.\n\n\"Ryan would like to have a lot of tattoos, but because he's an actor he can't,\" Cianfrance said. So, in both films, Gosling skim-coated himself with temporary tats. In \"The Place Beyond the Pines\"-a brooding story of a motorcycle bandit (Gosling), the cop who confronts him (Bradley Cooper), and the violent friendship of their sons, years later-\"there's a moment where Ryan holds his baby, who's clean, and you can see that he feels dirty,\" Cianfrance said. \"That is the essence of the moment I had five years ago when I held my second boy: How can I hold this child? How can I keep him from being infected by the fire that burns in me? Passion can be great for art, but it's very destructive.\" Having finished his cappuccino, he poured glass after glass of water into the remaining foam and drank them off until the cup was clean.\n\n\"I never understood why people had all these smiling family photographs in their houses,\" he said. \"One of the first pictures I took as a kid was my brother in his underwear and my mom in curlers, and they're screaming at each other. I like arguing-it feels natural. Love is bigger than being satiated by happiness.\"\n\nStaring into his cup, he continued, \"I stopped drinking for eight years as a discipline to make 'Blue Valentine.' We shot the beforehand stuff first, and my idea was that I'd have a drink when I started shooting the present-day stuff, that it would put me in the right frame of mind. But during that period of drinking I almost got into a fight with my neighbor while I was holding my baby, and I almost divorced my wife at dinner. So I decided: If I can stop for a movie, I can stop for my life. Because anger is my go-to emotion, and drink sure doesn't help.\"\n\nCianfrance now hopes that his \"amigo\" tattoo makes him look tough but friendly. \"Sometimes, when I'm gone, working,\" he said, \"I feel like my family can have a peace they don't have when I'm there. I had a dream last night that we all lived in a houseboat on a lake, and I was spraying a hose on the lake, and the lake water gradually became crystal-clear. I could see all these fish with their rainbow shimmers, and then there were dolphins around them, the lake becoming flush with life-and all of a sudden a giant shark came underneath everything, this huge dark shape, and I knew my family could never swim in the lake again.\" ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "War of Choice\n\nMarco Rubio, a Republican who is the junior senator from Florida, has a full head of thick black hair and a movie star's baby face. He speaks passionately and argues persuasively. Just forty years old, he has the youthful glamour of a Kennedy, with an attractive wife and four children. Tea Party activists love Rubio, and he is surely the most prominent Hispanic Republican in America. His longtime political mentor, Al Cardenas, who is the former Florida Republican state chairman, thinks Rubio's most winning quality is his humility: \"He's the kind of young man you want as your own son.\" Rubio's parents immigrated from Cuba during the Eisenhower years, and, in his first speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate, in June, Rubio sounded a little like a certain former junior senator from Illinois, who soon went on to bigger things. \"We should never forget who we Americans are,\" he said. \"Every single one of us is the descendant of a go-getter. Of dreamers and of believers. Of men and women who took risks and made sacrifices because they wanted their children to live better off than themselves. And so, whether they came here on the Mayflower, on a slave ship, or on an airplane from Havana, we are all descendants of the men and women who built here the nation that saved the world.\"\n\nNational Republicans say openly that Rubio is a top contender to be the Party's 2012 Vice-Presidential nominee. He could, they suggest, secure victory for the Party in Florida and win over Hispanic voters in other states, many of whom have been angered by the G.O.P. Presidential candidates' harsh positions on immigration. Political betting markets list Rubio as many times more likely than anyone else to be the nominee. \"Rubio is our superstar,\" Ed Rollins, a former Presidential campaign manager for Ronald Reagan, Mike Huckabee, and Michele Bachmann, says. \"He would be my first choice. My premise is that if you can add someone to your ticket that gives you a state you don't have you're way ahead of the game. No Republican can win without Florida.\"\n\nBut other Republicans worry that straight identity politics (Republicans need to win over Hispanics; Rubio is Hispanic; Rubio is our savior) might not work in their favor in this case. Rubio's positions on immigration are to the right of those held by most Hispanic Americans. And these views have helped lead him into a war with Univision, which is the dominant Spanish-language media outlet in the country, and which champions immigration reform. Many national Republicans have stood by Rubio in that conflict, but it is politically risky to fight with a network that has as much influence as Univision and, more important, it is perilous to maintain positions on immigration that anger the majority of Hispanics. Because Rubio comes from the small Cuban community, whose members have long been granted automatic citizenship-as political exiles, not as immigrants-he risks being perceived by Hispanics as an out-of-touch élitist. Earlier this year, the conservative columnist Ruben Navarrette wrote on CNN.com about the political dilemma faced by Rubio and his party: \"Marco Rubio is the Republican Party's Superman. And the immigration issue, if not handled correctly, is his kryptonite.\"\n\nRubio's fight with Univision began in early July, when Gerardo Reyes, the chief of the network's investigative unit, called Rubio's older sister, Barbara Cicilia. Reyes said he had learned that, more than two decades earlier, her husband, Orlando Cicilia, had been convicted as part of a drug-trafficking ring that paid off cops and sold cocaine by the kilo. Other members of the ring had murdered and dismembered a government informer. Barbara said that her husband had never been arrested, and hung up the phone.\n\nBut, as Reyes knew, in 1989 a jury had found Cicilia guilty of possessing large quantities of cocaine and marijuana and of travelling to several states to sell and deliver drugs. He was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison. After he was paroled, in 2000, Rubio's parents went to live with the Cicilias, in their new home; Rubio's father died in 2010, but his mother still lives there. Cicilia has not been actively engaged in Rubio's political campaigns, but the night Rubio was elected speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, in November, 2006, he joined the family on the stage. When Rubio ran for the Senate, in 2010, Cicilia's teen-age son was his travel aide. Orlando Cicilia was on the stage again when Rubio declared victory.\n\nThe reach of Univision is often underappreciated. It is watched regularly by two-thirds of all Hispanic television viewers in the U.S. In Los Angeles, Miami, Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, and Phoenix, its stations' newscasts rate higher than those of their English-speaking competitors. Some nights, the network's national ratings exceed those of ABC, CBS, Fox, or NBC. And the audience is growing, in part because of demographics. Today, fifteen per cent of Americans are Hispanic; in 2050, the percentage will have doubled. According to Univision's news president, Isaac Lee, the network is openly committed to \"pro-Hispanic\" immigration reform, and it has a particular slant on the news: a dog biting any man is not a story, but a dog biting a Hispanic man is. Sergio Bendixen, perhaps the leading Hispanic public-opinion researcher in the U.S. and Latin America, says that Univision is the most respected institution among Hispanics in the country, ahead of the armed forces and the Catholic Church. \"It is considered to be the institution that protects Latin-Americans in the U.S. and fights the institutions that abuse them,\" he says.\n\nMuch of the network's content is soft-it broadcasts seven hours of soap operas daily-and Lee was hired, in December, 2010, to strengthen its reporting. Lee is a prominent journalist from Colombia, where, as a magazine editor, he aggressively pursued drug cartels. He is forty years old and heavyset, with thick dark-gray glasses that dominate his face, a straggly black beard, and an ebullient personality; the first day we met in Miami, he wore an untucked, open-necked shirt. Last year, he hired Reyes, a former member of a Pulitzer Prize-winning team at the Miami Herald , as chief investigator.\n\nForty minutes after Barbara Cicilia got off the phone with Reyes, Alex Burgos, Senator Rubio's communications director, e-mailed Univision, asking if someone had made a prank call. Lee responded that it was no prank, and that he wanted \"to know the effect that his brother-in-law's conviction had on his family, as part of a larger profile piece on Rubio.\" The next day, Burgos called Reyes and asked why a conviction that occurred when Marco Rubio was a teen-ager was relevant. He noted that the story was not new: in 1987, the Miami Herald had run a front-page article describing the arrest of Cicilia and his cohorts. Burgos also e-mailed Univision's C.E.O., Randy Falco, complaining that a Univision camera crew had staked out Barbara and Orlando Cicilia's home. He said that Univision's pursuit of this story reeked of tabloid journalism. \"Is it really your position that the entire life history of every member of a public official's family is a legitimate news story?\"\n\nFalco agreed with Lee that it was: the story was accurate, and Rubio's family was central to his political narrative. He said that the Senator had to deal with the scrutiny that goes with becoming a national figure. And, even though the details of Orlando Cicilia's crimes were known to readers twenty years ago, his connection to the sitting senator had never been reported.\n\nA conference call was arranged with Burgos and Todd Harris, Rubio's senior political adviser. In addition to Lee, five people from Univision were on the call: Reyes, the reporter; the news vice-president, Daniel Coronell; the managing editor, Maria Martinez-Henao; and two senior Univision attorneys. Rubio's staff wanted to kill the story. Univision wanted Rubio to answer questions on camera.\n\nThe call ended civilly, but the next day Burgos e-mailed Lee and declared that, if Univision aired the piece, Senator Rubio would find it \"impossible for us to have a productive relationship with your organization.\"\n\nOn July 11th, four days after the conference call, Univision led off the evening news with the story. The network reported that Senator Rubio \"provided generous details about his family\" in the past. \"But there is one family episode that the Senator does not want to talk about.\" In recounting Cicilia's criminal past, the network took care to note that \"Barbara Rubio was not arrested or indicted,\" and that Marco Rubio was a high-school student at the time.\n\nThe report was personally distressing for Senator Rubio. \"He was very upset about this, because it pained his elderly mother, who sits down and watches Univision every night,\" Ana Navarro, a close friend, says. \"His sister works in a public school. She probably had friends and colleagues who did not know this happened.\"\n\nThis fall, I discussed the story with the Univision anchor Jorge Ramos, who was away on July 11th but usually hosts the network's evening news and also has a \"Meet the Press\"-like Sunday show called \"Al Punto.\" He is a slim, white-haired man who looks like an older Anderson Cooper. He has held his position for a quarter century and is probably the most visible Hispanic journalist in America. Ramos has written eleven books, mostly about immigration, and the subject fills his broadcasts. \"Marco Rubio could be the first Hispanic President of the United States,\" Ramos told me, over breakfast in a hotel restaurant, where Hispanic waiters and other employees came over to say hello and take his picture. \"We have to know his history. Should we wait for the New York Times or the Washington Post to ask this question?\"\n\nAlthough Univision hyped the story-one Univision Twitter feed announced, \" Univision investiga: Marco Rubio's family's drug-trafficking past\"-it did not initially receive much media attention. For two and a half months, it basically disappeared.\n\nIn late September, the Florida Republican Party accomplished a longtime goal of Rubio's: it moved up its primary from March to January 31st. This meant that Florida would play a bigger role in the selection of a G.O.P. Presidential nominee, and that Rubio, and his endorsement, would likely play a bigger role in the campaign. It also meant that immigration reform-a topic on which a tough stance plays better in Iowa and New Hampshire than in Florida-would become more important. And it gave increased relevance to a debate tentatively scheduled for January 29th on Univision. On September 30th, the primary date was officially changed.\n\nTwo days later, the Miami Herald and its Spanish-language sister paper, El Nuevo Herald , published a front-page account of the clash between Univision and Rubio. Written by Manny Garcia, the executive editor and general manager of El Nuevo Herald , and Marc Caputo, a reporter for the paper, it began:\n\nDays before Univision aired a controversial story this summer about the decades-old drug bust of Marco Rubio's brother-in-law, top staff with the Spanish-language media powerhouse offered what sounded like a deal to the U.S. senator's staff.\n\nIf Rubio appeared on Al Punto-Univision's national television show, where the topic of immigration would likely be discussed-then the story of his brother-in-law's troubles would be softened or might not run at all, according to Univision insiders and the Republican senator's staff. They say the offer was made by Univision's president of news, Isaac Lee.\n\nThe allegation of a shakedown by Univision hinged on comments by Rubio staffers, notes taken by Alex Burgos during the conference call, and unnamed Univision \"insiders.\" The Herald ' s account said that, near the end of the call, Lee \"suggested the drug-bust story could change-or not run at all,\" if Rubio agreed to be interviewed by Ramos on his Sunday-morning program. The Herald implied that Univision had tried to blackmail the Senator.\n\nThe article set off what appears in retrospect to have been a carefully orchestrated campaign. Three Florida Republicans and close Rubio allies-Representative David Rivera; the Florida House majority leader, Carlos Lopez-Cantera; and the Miami-Dade County Republican chairman, Erik Fresen-sent a public letter to the chairman of the Republican National Committee accusing Univision of extortion. They advised all the Republican Presidential candidates not to participate in the planned Univision primary debate on January 29th unless the network issued a public apology and fired Isaac Lee. They were urged to participate instead in a debate to be sponsored by NBC Universal's Spanish-language network, Telemundo, a network that is growing but whose audience is just over a third the size of Univision's.\n\nThe major Republican Presidential candidates, with the exception of Ron Paul, quickly announced that they would boycott any debate hosted by Univision, unless the network made amends. \"Obviously, we don't want to do anything to alienate Rubio or his constituents,\" Rollins told me. Rubio's friend Ana Navarro, who is now the national Hispanic chair for Jon Huntsman's campaign, says that she and other senior staff members briefed the candidate and he approved pulling out. She says that she did not speak with Rubio about this, and does not believe that his aides played a role. They didn't have to, she says. \"The reason this happened so quickly is not because Marco Rubio was pushing it but because the three guys who wrote the letter have access to national Republicans.\"\n\nTelemundo immediately announced that it wanted to broadcast a Spanish-language debate in December, hosted by its leading anchor, José Diaz-Balart, who is the brother of both a former and a current Republican member of Congress. Steve Schmidt, a senior adviser to John McCain's 2008 campaign and a former aide to George W. Bush, calls the boycott of Univision \"a profoundly shortsighted decision that ignores the changing demographics of the country. It's on the verge of insanity. Marco Rubio has a legitimate grievance, but the long-term interests of the Republican Party supersede the grievances of a U.S. senator.\"\n\nHaim Saban, the chairman of Univision, wrote, in an e-mail, \"The fact that Rubio and some Republican Presidential candidates have an anti-Hispanic stand that they don't want to share with our community is understandable but despicable. So 'boycotting' Univision, the largest Spanish-language media company in the U.S., is disingenuous at best and foolish at worst.\" Others at Univision go further, saying that the clash was a conspiracy, in which Rubio's staff, which is closely connected to the national Republican leadership, planted the story in the Herald and helped guide the G.O.P. response.\n\nRubio's allies dismiss this theory as ridiculous; they insist that the Miami Herald came up with the story itself, and that there was no coördinated response. Cardenas, who has just been elected national chairman of the American Conservative Union, says that Saban's statement is offensive. \"Who is he to determine what the points of view of all Americans are?\" he asks. To imply that thirty million Hispanics in this country \"are monolithic in their thought process is insulting to us and more of a plantation mentality,\" he says. \"We have different points of view all over America.\"\n\nWhen Ronald Reagan ran for reëlection, in 1984, he proclaimed, \"I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and lived here, even though some time back they may have entered illegally.\" After the election, President Reagan signed legislation that granted a path to citizenship to three million Hispanic Americans who had broken the law in the way they came here. Republican strategists today think that their candidate can't win without receiving at least thirty-five per cent of the Hispanic vote-as George W. Bush did in 2000 and 2004, but as John McCain did not in 2008.\n\nThere are eleven million people living in the U.S. who immigrated illegally, and all the Republican candidates oppose virtually any path to citizenship. When Newt Gingrich recently proposed offering legal residency-not citizenship-to those who have been here longer than twenty-five years, he was pilloried.\n\nThe Republican candidates seem to have been competing to see who can appear toughest on matters of immigration. Most use phrases like \"illegals\" or \"illegal aliens\" rather than \"undocumented immigrants.\" Although the rate of illegal immigration has declined dramatically in recent years, most of the candidates support a proposal for a barricade that could stretch two thousand miles along the Mexican border. Michele Bachmann has said that she wants a fence to cover \"every inch\" of the border; Herman Cain, who dropped out of the race in early December, said that this fence might be electrified, and joked that it should have an alligator-filled moat behind it. The Republican candidates, except for Huntsman, oppose the so-called Dream Act, a bill stalled in Congress in which a path to citizenship is provided for some students, and most oppose granting reduced in-state-university tuition rates for those immigrants. They have insisted that English be the country's official language. Most have also supported Arizona's new law on undocumented immigrants, which would allow police to stop anyone they deem suspicious and demand proof of citizenship. That law is currently under review by the United States Supreme Court.\n\nIn an October debate in Las Vegas, sponsored by CNN, Mitt Romney assailed Rick Perry for allowing a \"sixty per cent increase in illegal immigrants\" to his state. In response, Perry accused Romney of hiring \"illegals\" to mow his lawn.\n\nThe language appeals to Tea Party activists, who are angry that American laws are being broken and that illegal immigrants fill jobs that could go to Americans. However, it repels others, particularly immigrants. Jorge Ramos, who passionately advocates for an immigration-reform agenda, says that the overwhelming majority of his viewers are offended by the language used by the G.O.P. candidates and are opposed to nearly all the Party's major immigration proposals. The offense might be less among his viewers in Florida, because the state has large blocs of Puerto Ricans, who are citizens, and of Cuban exiles, who have citizenship because of a 1966 federal law. But about sixty per cent of Hispanic immigrants to this country are from Mexico, and another thirty per cent are from South or Central America. These immigrants make up the core of Univision's audience.\n\nLink copied\n\nMarco Rubio does not demonize \"illegals,\" and, as a Florida state legislator, he co-sponsored Florida's rough equivalent of the Dream Act. Hispanic lobbying groups in the state thought of him as an immigration-reform advocate. However, his positions have become more conservative. \"His immigration stance today is very different from the immigration positions he had when he was a state legislator and speaker of the Florida House,\" Arturo Vargas, the executive director of the nonpartisan National Association for Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, says. During the 2010 Senate campaign, Rubio energetically courted the Tea Party, opposing any path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and also the Dream Act. He declared his opposition to Sonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic appointed to the Supreme Court. She was not a strict interpreter of the Constitution, he said, adding, \"I reject the notion that judges should be representative of their sex, race, or class.\" Although Jorge Ramos has interviewed every President since George H. W. Bush and every prominent Hispanic public official, he has been unable to lure Rubio to his show to discuss immigration, or anything else.\n\nMarco Rubio's parents left Cuba in 1956, and settled in Miami, where their son was born, in 1971. The family struggled to make an adequate living, and moved to Las Vegas when Marco was eight; his father worked as a bartender and his mother as a hotel housekeeper. They returned to Miami in 1985, where his father eventually worked as a school crossing guard; his mother was a stock clerk at Kmart. Rubio attended Tarkio College, in Missouri, for a year, and transferred to Santa Fe Community College, then to the University of Florida, from which he graduated. He went to law school at the University of Miami, and while he was there Al Cardenas gave him his first political job, as the Dade County political coördinator for Bob Dole's 1996 Presidential campaign. Cardenas hired him as a summer intern at his law firm, and recruited him to join the firm when he graduated. In 1998, Rubio married Jeanette Dousdebes; they met as teen-agers, and she had recently worked as a cheerleader for the Miami Dolphins.\n\nRubio was first elected to the state legislature in 2000, and over the next eight years he became majority whip, majority leader, and then speaker of the Florida House. He was conservative, though not as conservative as he later became. His signature issues were tax and education reform. In 2008, he stepped down as speaker, resumed practicing law, and, during the Presidential campaign, became a TV political analyst for Univision. Two years later, he defeated both Kendrick Meek, an African-American Democratic congressman, and Charlie Crist, the former Republican governor, who ran as an independent, to win a seat in the Senate.\n\nI met Rubio in November in his Washington office. He was wearing a dark suit, a red polka-dot tie, and a pale-blue shirt. He stretched out in his chair, and crossed his legs. Rubio speaks in careful, complete sentences, without the groping pauses common among those new to national politics. The only hint of nervousness came as we talked about immigration: his right foot started twitching up and down, like an accelerating metronome. I asked how he would persuade Hispanic voters that the Republican Presidential candidates are not anti-immigrant.\n\n\"Economic issues are predominant,\" he said. \"Republican policies are a lot better for that than the Democratic Party's. That's the fundamental issue. When we talk about rhetoric, particularly rhetoric around immigration, I've always said that our emphasis should be on the fact that we're in favor of legal immigration. And sometimes when the focus is on illegal immigration it creates the impression-unfairly, in many instances-that Republicans are against immigrants or against immigration.\" As long as unemployment is high, he said, he would not relax immigration restrictions. But, if it dropped, he would like to ease immigration laws for highly educated immigrants, political refugees, and agricultural workers. However, he opposes all forms of amnesty, because that would reward lawbreakers.\n\nWhen I asked him about the fence, he responded, \"That's a tactic,\" and, \"I'm not an expert on immigration tactics and how to enforce the law.\" If there were an effective immigration system, the need for such a fence \"diminishes over time,\" he said. \"I'm not against a fence. I'm not sure it solves all of our problems, either,\" particularly since \"a fence doesn't do anything\" to block the roughly forty per cent of illegal immigrants who come here on legal visas and then stay beyond their expiration. In response to a question about Arizona's stringent law, he said, \"Arizona had a constitutional right to pass that law. And it had a dramatic public-safety need, which is why the state passed it. I don't believe states should be in the business of doing that. I don't think Florida needs one of those laws.\" He favors a uniform national law but does not specify what it would entail.\n\nI asked if he agrees with analysts who say that winning more than thirty-five per cent of the Hispanic vote is crucial for a Republican victory this fall.\n\n\"I think that analyzes the wrong way,\" he said. \"First of all, it assumes the Hispanic voter is some sort of a voting bloc across the country, when in fact there's tremendous diversity. A lot of it is geographic.\" He added that Hispanics are well assimilated, and that \"this idea that immigration is the only issue that Hispanics care about is absurd.\"\n\nI cited speculation that he might join the 2012 Republican ticket, to which he responded, \"I'm not going to be the Vice-Presidential nominee.\"\n\nIs that to say you reject it?\n\n\"I do.\"\n\nWhen I pushed, he added, \"If I say I'm not going to do it, then I'm not going to accept it.\" (Several weeks after our interview, Sentinel announced that it would publish a memoir by Rubio next fall, which would be propitious timing for a Vice-Presidential nominee.)\n\nWhen we discussed Univision, Rubio strove to appear nonchalant, while dismissing the network's influence. \"I used to work there-they have good soap operas,\" he said. \"The idea that somehow voters of Hispanic descent somehow only watch a Spanish-speaking network is just not true. I think they get their news from everywhere. Just as we all do. Especially young voters.\" According to Nielsen ratings, though, nearly seventy per cent of Univision's eighteen-to-forty-nine-year-old viewers each night watch no other network. By contrast, less than ten per cent of the audience of NBC, ABC, CBS, and Fox watches only those stations.\n\nRubio waved away a question about his brother-in-law's conviction. \"It doesn't even merit discussion,\" he said. When I asked for a fuller explanation, he replied, \"I just don't think that's a valid news story that a news organization runs. I thought that was a tabloid news item. I don't deal with tabloids.\" He spoke calmly, but his right leg jiggled faster.\n\nBefore leaving, I mentioned that the two aides on the conference call with Univision had said that the network tried to shake them down, and asked if he agreed.\n\n\"I don't have anything to add.\"\n\nCould I see the notes that Alex Burgos took during the call?\n\nAfter I asked a second time, he said, \"It's fine.\"\n\nIf Univision did try to blackmail Rubio, there would be a simple explanation for the controversy this fall. Employees at the network might have heard about it and taken the story to the Miami Herald . The Herald might have got confirmation from Rubio's staff. After the story ran, the Republican Presidential candidates might have been genuinely outraged at Univision's yellow journalism and decided that they should not dignify the network with a debate.\n\nThis pristine explanation, however, is too simple. The notes of the conversation between Rubio's office and Univision don't provide a convincing case that Univision proposed dropping any mention of Senator Rubio's brother-in-law's criminal past if Rubio consented to an interview. They, and interviews with the people involved in the conflict, suggest that a complicated and politically risky game unfolded as the Republican Party shifted the date of the Florida primary. Rubio had every reason to want to punish Univision, and the national Republican Party had every reason to want to avoid holding a debate on a network that would ask aggressive questions about immigration. Both got what they desired, but perhaps at a cost.\n\nBurgos's notes from the July conference call with Univision are written in neat, small script on two pages of a flip notebook. The phone dialogue, mostly between Todd Harris and Isaac Lee, unfolds:\n\nT ODD : Don't understand rationale for doing story. Absurd.\n\nI SAAC : Just doing our job. . . .\n\nT ODD : Just because stories are interesting they don't turn into national news stories. Fair game if this were a current issue.\n\nThe notes eventually report that Lee said Univision would \"abandon this piece in favor of 'Al Punto,' \" but the next sentence contradicts this, saying that Lee made \"no promises.\" Later, Burgos writes a comment of his own: \"quid pro quo.\" But the notes also say that Lee said he would offer \"no guarantees\" to kill the story if Senator Rubio granted a full interview. The notes conclude with Burgos asking if the story might not run if Senator Rubio coöperated on a profile of his life or gave an interview on \"Al Punto.\"\n\nLee's response, Burgos writes, was \"Your interpretation is fair.\" Lee says, however, that he offered three Univision options: report a stand-alone news story on Orlando Cicilia; have Senator Rubio coöperate on a network profile; or have him be interviewed on Jorge Ramos's \"Al Punto.\" Whatever the venue, Lee says, the issue of Orlando Cicilia would have been raised.\n\nThe Herald portrayed the conversation as a shakedown; the notes suggest a contentious discussion. Furthermore, all six of the Univision employees on the call deny that there was any such offer and say they were not called. When I asked Manny Garcia, one of the article's co-authors, whether any of the \"Univision insiders\" he spoke to were among those six, at first he told me that the network wouldn't \"volunteer\" anyone on the call. He went on to say, \"The sources were just people with knowledge of the conversation\"-meaning that he hadn't talked to anyone on the call. Later, he said that he wouldn't discuss specific sources.\n\nAll the Univision news-department people on that call say that the Herald story was unfair, and have expressed pride in how Lee acted. \"I left the conference call feeling good, confident that we had conducted ourselves in the utmost professional manner,\" the managing editor, Maria Martinez-Henao, told me. At the end of the call, the news vice-president, Daniel Coronell, told me, the two lawyers \"applauded.\" Reyes, the reporter, said, \"If Isaac or Daniel decided to trade my story for an interview, I leave the room\" and, presumably, the company. Univision executives also ask whether, even if they were totally unethical, they would be so stupid as to try to blackmail Rubio staff members on a call with two company attorneys. And if Burgos was outraged by Lee's alleged \"quid pro quo,\" why did he not mention it in his e-mail to Lee the day after the call? When asked this question, Burgos declined to respond.\n\nThe Herald reporter Marc Caputo says that the tip for the story first came to the Herald \"from friends of Rubio.\" Caputo found the story credible in part because he thinks that Univision has become so partisan that it would be willing to cross journalistic lines to have the opportunity to grill Rubio on immigration. He said, in an e-mail, that the network \"has virtually crusaded on behalf of its viewership for the Dream Act,\" and that \"it's not tough to believe\" that the network would have \"essentially punished Rubio for not going along with the program.\"\n\nOne can fairly ask, as Caputo does, whether Univision crossed boundaries to hype its story. For example, soon after the story ran, a Univision reporter, reading from prepared notes, ambushed Florida's governor, Rick Scott, by asking, \"If something happened or they discovered something about your brother-in-law-this is a hypothetical case-would you resign?\"\n\nOne can also ask, as the Herald and Rubio do, whether Univision should have aired the story at all. It was pushing the limits of privacy and, though it can persuasively argue that Orlando Cicilia's arrest and his life might have had an influence on Rubio, the story produced no evidence that this was so or that Cicilia was instrumental in any of Rubio's campaigns. Still, Univision has a plausible response. \"We are not here to get into the private lives of people,\" Isaac Lee said. \"We don't look at who is having an affair with whom. But when you put together your nephew's participation in the campaign . . . and a family member who was part of a criminal organization, you really ought to know how that impacted\" Rubio's life.\n\nRegardless of where you come down, Presidential debates on prominent media outlets are not usually boycotted because of somewhat overhyped news stories or murky civic debates. It seems much more likely that boycotting a debate on Univision was a convenient way for the Republican candidates to appease Senator Rubio and, at the same time, avoid engaging in a debate on the eve of the Florida primary that would likely inflame Hispanics. And there's little question that a debate sponsored by Univision, which Republicans now seem to view the way Democrats view Fox, would have been much tougher than one sponsored by Telemundo.\n\nSenator Rubio is right that voters see the economy as the most pivotal issue of the campaign. A nationwide Univision poll this fall of a thousand Hispanic registered voters encouraged Republicans, because it revealed that only one in three \"strongly approves of the President,\" a lower level of support than Obama received in 2008. There was also, however, reason for Republicans to be frightened by the poll. Nearly two-thirds of those polled, when offered a hypothetical candidate whose economic policies they embraced \"but who used strong anti-immigrant rhetoric,\" said that \"the rhetoric would make them less likely to vote for that candidate.\" As with candidates perceived as anti-Israel by Jews, or racist by blacks, an anti-immigrant perception is toxic among Hispanics. A December poll from impreMedia and Latino Decisions revealed that seventy-three per cent of Hispanics believe that the Republican Party either doesn't \"care too much\" about Hispanics or is \"hostile\" to them.\n\nIt's also not clear that stringent immigration positions are preferred by non-Hispanics during a general election. A Univision poll this fall of a thousand Americans found that nearly sixty per cent of them, and fifty-three per cent of those identified as Republicans, favored \"a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\" Starting with the January 31st Florida primary, and then moving on to primaries in other states with substantial Hispanic populations-Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, California-immigration issues will be prominent. \"The Republican Party doesn't have a monolithic position,\" Steve Schmidt says, noting that the Republican governors of Nevada and New Mexico are Hispanic. But he worries that the Republican candidates for President who have spoken harshly about illegal immigrants will find it difficult to extract themselves from the box they've sealed themselves in.\n\nYet the candidates don't seem to be worried about the long-term consequences of the positions they've taken to win primaries. When I spoke with a top Romney strategist, he acknowledged that better communication with Hispanic voters is \"something I'm not immersed in at the moment.\" A prominent national Republican who did not want to be identified agreed with Schmidt. Taking a harsh stand against immigration, he says, \"is unbelievable shortsightedness,\" because it ignores a fundamental truth about elections: \"Issues are not how voters decide. It's what kind of a person they think the person is. They don't like people who they feel don't like them.\" Debating on Univision might have solidified those views, or it might have given the candidates a chance to truly ameliorate them.\n\nRepublicans speak of Senator Rubio as a Vice-Presidential candidate in large part because they think he can help deliver Hispanic voters. But it's not clear that he can. In the 2010 Senate election, he won fifty-five per cent of the Hispanic vote, but this was mostly because he won three-quarters of the Cuban vote. He won only about a third of the Puerto Rican vote and not much more of the remainder of the Hispanic vote. Jeb Bush, a Florida Republican with softer positions on immigration than Rubio-he has supported tuition breaks for the children of illegal immigrants, for example-won nearly two-thirds of the Hispanic vote in his last state-wide election, including fifty-five per cent of the Puerto Rican vote. In the December poll by impreMedia and Latino Decisions, only thirteen per cent of Hispanics said that Rubio's inclusion on the national ticket would make them much more likely to vote Republican; ten per cent said it would make them much less likely.\n\nRubio's potential appeal to immigrants who have struggled to become citizens probably wasn't helped when, in late October, the Washington Post and the St. Petersburg Times reported that, contrary to Rubio's claims, his parents were not \"exiles,\" who fled Cuba after Castro seized control, in January, 1959. They arrived on legal visas, three years earlier, when Fulgencio Batista was President. Since Rubio was not born until 1971, his telling of the story could be an honest mistake; or maybe it was just a bit of puffery on a résumé. Whatever the case, Rubio's battles with Univision, and his hard-line position on immigration, will not advance his popularity among Hispanics. Jorge Ramos asks a question that he undoubtedly would have asked Senator Rubio on \"Al Punto\": \"What would happen to his parents if they were to arrive today from a Latin-American country?\"\n\nRubio has a good tale to tell. His family struggled, and he has earned his success. A more experienced politician might have handled the July phone call to Barbara Cicilia very differently and coolly behaved like the humble son described by Rubio's mentor, Al Cardenas. Rubio could have described his brother-in-law's story as one of redemption, not shame. He could have said that Orlando Cicilia committed a crime and was properly punished for it. With the benefit of understanding, and family support, he was then able to emerge as a productive U.S. citizen. That, Rubio could have said, is a truly American story. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "War of Choice\n\nMarco Rubio, a Republican who is the junior senator from Florida, has a full head of thick black hair and a movie star's baby face. He speaks passionately and argues persuasively. Just forty years old, he has the youthful glamour of a Kennedy, with an attractive wife and four children. Tea Party activists love Rubio, and he is surely the most prominent Hispanic Republican in America. His longtime political mentor, Al Cardenas, who is the former Florida Republican state chairman, thinks Rubio's most winning quality is his humility: \"He's the kind of young man you want as your own son.\" Rubio's parents immigrated from Cuba during the Eisenhower years, and, in his first speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate, in June, Rubio sounded a little like a certain former junior senator from Illinois, who soon went on to bigger things. \"We should never forget who we Americans are,\" he said. \"Every single one of us is the descendant of a go-getter. Of dreamers and of believers. Of men and women who took risks and made sacrifices because they wanted their children to live better off than themselves. And so, whether they came here on the Mayflower, on a slave ship, or on an airplane from Havana, we are all descendants of the men and women who built here the nation that saved the world.\"\n\nNational Republicans say openly that Rubio is a top contender to be the Party's 2012 Vice-Presidential nominee. He could, they suggest, secure victory for the Party in Florida and win over Hispanic voters in other states, many of whom have been angered by the G.O.P. Presidential candidates' harsh positions on immigration. Political betting markets list Rubio as many times more likely than anyone else to be the nominee. \"Rubio is our superstar,\" Ed Rollins, a former Presidential campaign manager for Ronald Reagan, Mike Huckabee, and Michele Bachmann, says. \"He would be my first choice. My premise is that if you can add someone to your ticket that gives you a state you don't have you're way ahead of the game. No Republican can win without Florida.\"\n\nBut other Republicans worry that straight identity politics (Republicans need to win over Hispanics; Rubio is Hispanic; Rubio is our savior) might not work in their favor in this case. Rubio's positions on immigration are to the right of those held by most Hispanic Americans. And these views have helped lead him into a war with Univision, which is the dominant Spanish-language media outlet in the country, and which champions immigration reform. Many national Republicans have stood by Rubio in that conflict, but it is politically risky to fight with a network that has as much influence as Univision and, more important, it is perilous to maintain positions on immigration that anger the majority of Hispanics. Because Rubio comes from the small Cuban community, whose members have long been granted automatic citizenship-as political exiles, not as immigrants-he risks being perceived by Hispanics as an out-of-touch élitist. Earlier this year, the conservative columnist Ruben Navarrette wrote on CNN.com about the political dilemma faced by Rubio and his party: \"Marco Rubio is the Republican Party's Superman. And the immigration issue, if not handled correctly, is his kryptonite.\"\n\nRubio's fight with Univision began in early July, when Gerardo Reyes, the chief of the network's investigative unit, called Rubio's older sister, Barbara Cicilia. Reyes said he had learned that, more than two decades earlier, her husband, Orlando Cicilia, had been convicted as part of a drug-trafficking ring that paid off cops and sold cocaine by the kilo. Other members of the ring had murdered and dismembered a government informer. Barbara said that her husband had never been arrested, and hung up the phone.\n\nBut, as Reyes knew, in 1989 a jury had found Cicilia guilty of possessing large quantities of cocaine and marijuana and of travelling to several states to sell and deliver drugs. He was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison. After he was paroled, in 2000, Rubio's parents went to live with the Cicilias, in their new home; Rubio's father died in 2010, but his mother still lives there. Cicilia has not been actively engaged in Rubio's political campaigns, but the night Rubio was elected speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, in November, 2006, he joined the family on the stage. When Rubio ran for the Senate, in 2010, Cicilia's teen-age son was his travel aide. Orlando Cicilia was on the stage again when Rubio declared victory.\n\nThe reach of Univision is often underappreciated. It is watched regularly by two-thirds of all Hispanic television viewers in the U.S. In Los Angeles, Miami, Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, and Phoenix, its stations' newscasts rate higher than those of their English-speaking competitors. Some nights, the network's national ratings exceed those of ABC, CBS, Fox, or NBC. And the audience is growing, in part because of demographics. Today, fifteen per cent of Americans are Hispanic; in 2050, the percentage will have doubled. According to Univision's news president, Isaac Lee, the network is openly committed to \"pro-Hispanic\" immigration reform, and it has a particular slant on the news: a dog biting any man is not a story, but a dog biting a Hispanic man is. Sergio Bendixen, perhaps the leading Hispanic public-opinion researcher in the U.S. and Latin America, says that Univision is the most respected institution among Hispanics in the country, ahead of the armed forces and the Catholic Church. \"It is considered to be the institution that protects Latin-Americans in the U.S. and fights the institutions that abuse them,\" he says.\n\nMuch of the network's content is soft-it broadcasts seven hours of soap operas daily-and Lee was hired, in December, 2010, to strengthen its reporting. Lee is a prominent journalist from Colombia, where, as a magazine editor, he aggressively pursued drug cartels. He is forty years old and heavyset, with thick dark-gray glasses that dominate his face, a straggly black beard, and an ebullient personality; the first day we met in Miami, he wore an untucked, open-necked shirt. Last year, he hired Reyes, a former member of a Pulitzer Prize-winning team at the Miami Herald , as chief investigator.\n\nForty minutes after Barbara Cicilia got off the phone with Reyes, Alex Burgos, Senator Rubio's communications director, e-mailed Univision, asking if someone had made a prank call. Lee responded that it was no prank, and that he wanted \"to know the effect that his brother-in-law's conviction had on his family, as part of a larger profile piece on Rubio.\" The next day, Burgos called Reyes and asked why a conviction that occurred when Marco Rubio was a teen-ager was relevant. He noted that the story was not new: in 1987, the Miami Herald had run a front-page article describing the arrest of Cicilia and his cohorts. Burgos also e-mailed Univision's C.E.O., Randy Falco, complaining that a Univision camera crew had staked out Barbara and Orlando Cicilia's home. He said that Univision's pursuit of this story reeked of tabloid journalism. \"Is it really your position that the entire life history of every member of a public official's family is a legitimate news story?\"\n\nFalco agreed with Lee that it was: the story was accurate, and Rubio's family was central to his political narrative. He said that the Senator had to deal with the scrutiny that goes with becoming a national figure. And, even though the details of Orlando Cicilia's crimes were known to readers twenty years ago, his connection to the sitting senator had never been reported.\n\nA conference call was arranged with Burgos and Todd Harris, Rubio's senior political adviser. In addition to Lee, five people from Univision were on the call: Reyes, the reporter; the news vice-president, Daniel Coronell; the managing editor, Maria Martinez-Henao; and two senior Univision attorneys. Rubio's staff wanted to kill the story. Univision wanted Rubio to answer questions on camera.\n\nThe call ended civilly, but the next day Burgos e-mailed Lee and declared that, if Univision aired the piece, Senator Rubio would find it \"impossible for us to have a productive relationship with your organization.\"\n\nOn July 11th, four days after the conference call, Univision led off the evening news with the story. The network reported that Senator Rubio \"provided generous details about his family\" in the past. \"But there is one family episode that the Senator does not want to talk about.\" In recounting Cicilia's criminal past, the network took care to note that \"Barbara Rubio was not arrested or indicted,\" and that Marco Rubio was a high-school student at the time.\n\nThe report was personally distressing for Senator Rubio. \"He was very upset about this, because it pained his elderly mother, who sits down and watches Univision every night,\" Ana Navarro, a close friend, says. \"His sister works in a public school. She probably had friends and colleagues who did not know this happened.\"\n\nThis fall, I discussed the story with the Univision anchor Jorge Ramos, who was away on July 11th but usually hosts the network's evening news and also has a \"Meet the Press\"-like Sunday show called \"Al Punto.\" He is a slim, white-haired man who looks like an older Anderson Cooper. He has held his position for a quarter century and is probably the most visible Hispanic journalist in America. Ramos has written eleven books, mostly about immigration, and the subject fills his broadcasts. \"Marco Rubio could be the first Hispanic President of the United States,\" Ramos told me, over breakfast in a hotel restaurant, where Hispanic waiters and other employees came over to say hello and take his picture. \"We have to know his history. Should we wait for the New York Times or the Washington Post to ask this question?\"\n\nAlthough Univision hyped the story-one Univision Twitter feed announced, \" Univision investiga: Marco Rubio's family's drug-trafficking past\"-it did not initially receive much media attention. For two and a half months, it basically disappeared.\n\nIn late September, the Florida Republican Party accomplished a longtime goal of Rubio's: it moved up its primary from March to January 31st. This meant that Florida would play a bigger role in the selection of a G.O.P. Presidential nominee, and that Rubio, and his endorsement, would likely play a bigger role in the campaign. It also meant that immigration reform-a topic on which a tough stance plays better in Iowa and New Hampshire than in Florida-would become more important. And it gave increased relevance to a debate tentatively scheduled for January 29th on Univision. On September 30th, the primary date was officially changed.\n\nTwo days later, the Miami Herald and its Spanish-language sister paper, El Nuevo Herald , published a front-page account of the clash between Univision and Rubio. Written by Manny Garcia, the executive editor and general manager of El Nuevo Herald , and Marc Caputo, a reporter for the paper, it began:\n\nDays before Univision aired a controversial story this summer about the decades-old drug bust of Marco Rubio's brother-in-law, top staff with the Spanish-language media powerhouse offered what sounded like a deal to the U.S. senator's staff.\n\nIf Rubio appeared on Al Punto-Univision's national television show, where the topic of immigration would likely be discussed-then the story of his brother-in-law's troubles would be softened or might not run at all, according to Univision insiders and the Republican senator's staff. They say the offer was made by Univision's president of news, Isaac Lee.\n\nThe allegation of a shakedown by Univision hinged on comments by Rubio staffers, notes taken by Alex Burgos during the conference call, and unnamed Univision \"insiders.\" The Herald ' s account said that, near the end of the call, Lee \"suggested the drug-bust story could change-or not run at all,\" if Rubio agreed to be interviewed by Ramos on his Sunday-morning program. The Herald implied that Univision had tried to blackmail the Senator.\n\nThe article set off what appears in retrospect to have been a carefully orchestrated campaign. Three Florida Republicans and close Rubio allies-Representative David Rivera; the Florida House majority leader, Carlos Lopez-Cantera; and the Miami-Dade County Republican chairman, Erik Fresen-sent a public letter to the chairman of the Republican National Committee accusing Univision of extortion. They advised all the Republican Presidential candidates not to participate in the planned Univision primary debate on January 29th unless the network issued a public apology and fired Isaac Lee. They were urged to participate instead in a debate to be sponsored by NBC Universal's Spanish-language network, Telemundo, a network that is growing but whose audience is just over a third the size of Univision's.\n\nThe major Republican Presidential candidates, with the exception of Ron Paul, quickly announced that they would boycott any debate hosted by Univision, unless the network made amends. \"Obviously, we don't want to do anything to alienate Rubio or his constituents,\" Rollins told me. Rubio's friend Ana Navarro, who is now the national Hispanic chair for Jon Huntsman's campaign, says that she and other senior staff members briefed the candidate and he approved pulling out. She says that she did not speak with Rubio about this, and does not believe that his aides played a role. They didn't have to, she says. \"The reason this happened so quickly is not because Marco Rubio was pushing it but because the three guys who wrote the letter have access to national Republicans.\"\n\nTelemundo immediately announced that it wanted to broadcast a Spanish-language debate in December, hosted by its leading anchor, José Diaz-Balart, who is the brother of both a former and a current Republican member of Congress. Steve Schmidt, a senior adviser to John McCain's 2008 campaign and a former aide to George W. Bush, calls the boycott of Univision \"a profoundly shortsighted decision that ignores the changing demographics of the country. It's on the verge of insanity. Marco Rubio has a legitimate grievance, but the long-term interests of the Republican Party supersede the grievances of a U.S. senator.\"\n\nHaim Saban, the chairman of Univision, wrote, in an e-mail, \"The fact that Rubio and some Republican Presidential candidates have an anti-Hispanic stand that they don't want to share with our community is understandable but despicable. So 'boycotting' Univision, the largest Spanish-language media company in the U.S., is disingenuous at best and foolish at worst.\" Others at Univision go further, saying that the clash was a conspiracy, in which Rubio's staff, which is closely connected to the national Republican leadership, planted the story in the Herald and helped guide the G.O.P. response.\n\nRubio's allies dismiss this theory as ridiculous; they insist that the Miami Herald came up with the story itself, and that there was no coördinated response. Cardenas, who has just been elected national chairman of the American Conservative Union, says that Saban's statement is offensive. \"Who is he to determine what the points of view of all Americans are?\" he asks. To imply that thirty million Hispanics in this country \"are monolithic in their thought process is insulting to us and more of a plantation mentality,\" he says. \"We have different points of view all over America.\"\n\nWhen Ronald Reagan ran for reëlection, in 1984, he proclaimed, \"I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and lived here, even though some time back they may have entered illegally.\" After the election, President Reagan signed legislation that granted a path to citizenship to three million Hispanic Americans who had broken the law in the way they came here. Republican strategists today think that their candidate can't win without receiving at least thirty-five per cent of the Hispanic vote-as George W. Bush did in 2000 and 2004, but as John McCain did not in 2008.\n\nThere are eleven million people living in the U.S. who immigrated illegally, and all the Republican candidates oppose virtually any path to citizenship. When Newt Gingrich recently proposed offering legal residency-not citizenship-to those who have been here longer than twenty-five years, he was pilloried.\n\nThe Republican candidates seem to have been competing to see who can appear toughest on matters of immigration. Most use phrases like \"illegals\" or \"illegal aliens\" rather than \"undocumented immigrants.\" Although the rate of illegal immigration has declined dramatically in recent years, most of the candidates support a proposal for a barricade that could stretch two thousand miles along the Mexican border. Michele Bachmann has said that she wants a fence to cover \"every inch\" of the border; Herman Cain, who dropped out of the race in early December, said that this fence might be electrified, and joked that it should have an alligator-filled moat behind it. The Republican candidates, except for Huntsman, oppose the so-called Dream Act, a bill stalled in Congress in which a path to citizenship is provided for some students, and most oppose granting reduced in-state-university tuition rates for those immigrants. They have insisted that English be the country's official language. Most have also supported Arizona's new law on undocumented immigrants, which would allow police to stop anyone they deem suspicious and demand proof of citizenship. That law is currently under review by the United States Supreme Court.\n\nIn an October debate in Las Vegas, sponsored by CNN, Mitt Romney assailed Rick Perry for allowing a \"sixty per cent increase in illegal immigrants\" to his state. In response, Perry accused Romney of hiring \"illegals\" to mow his lawn.\n\nThe language appeals to Tea Party activists, who are angry that American laws are being broken and that illegal immigrants fill jobs that could go to Americans. However, it repels others, particularly immigrants. Jorge Ramos, who passionately advocates for an immigration-reform agenda, says that the overwhelming majority of his viewers are offended by the language used by the G.O.P. candidates and are opposed to nearly all the Party's major immigration proposals. The offense might be less among his viewers in Florida, because the state has large blocs of Puerto Ricans, who are citizens, and of Cuban exiles, who have citizenship because of a 1966 federal law. But about sixty per cent of Hispanic immigrants to this country are from Mexico, and another thirty per cent are from South or Central America. These immigrants make up the core of Univision's audience.\n\nLink copied\n\nMarco Rubio does not demonize \"illegals,\" and, as a Florida state legislator, he co-sponsored Florida's rough equivalent of the Dream Act. Hispanic lobbying groups in the state thought of him as an immigration-reform advocate. However, his positions have become more conservative. \"His immigration stance today is very different from the immigration positions he had when he was a state legislator and speaker of the Florida House,\" Arturo Vargas, the executive director of the nonpartisan National Association for Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, says. During the 2010 Senate campaign, Rubio energetically courted the Tea Party, opposing any path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and also the Dream Act. He declared his opposition to Sonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic appointed to the Supreme Court. She was not a strict interpreter of the Constitution, he said, adding, \"I reject the notion that judges should be representative of their sex, race, or class.\" Although Jorge Ramos has interviewed every President since George H. W. Bush and every prominent Hispanic public official, he has been unable to lure Rubio to his show to discuss immigration, or anything else.\n\nMarco Rubio's parents left Cuba in 1956, and settled in Miami, where their son was born, in 1971. The family struggled to make an adequate living, and moved to Las Vegas when Marco was eight; his father worked as a bartender and his mother as a hotel housekeeper. They returned to Miami in 1985, where his father eventually worked as a school crossing guard; his mother was a stock clerk at Kmart. Rubio attended Tarkio College, in Missouri, for a year, and transferred to Santa Fe Community College, then to the University of Florida, from which he graduated. He went to law school at the University of Miami, and while he was there Al Cardenas gave him his first political job, as the Dade County political coördinator for Bob Dole's 1996 Presidential campaign. Cardenas hired him as a summer intern at his law firm, and recruited him to join the firm when he graduated. In 1998, Rubio married Jeanette Dousdebes; they met as teen-agers, and she had recently worked as a cheerleader for the Miami Dolphins.\n\nRubio was first elected to the state legislature in 2000, and over the next eight years he became majority whip, majority leader, and then speaker of the Florida House. He was conservative, though not as conservative as he later became. His signature issues were tax and education reform. In 2008, he stepped down as speaker, resumed practicing law, and, during the Presidential campaign, became a TV political analyst for Univision. Two years later, he defeated both Kendrick Meek, an African-American Democratic congressman, and Charlie Crist, the former Republican governor, who ran as an independent, to win a seat in the Senate.\n\nI met Rubio in November in his Washington office. He was wearing a dark suit, a red polka-dot tie, and a pale-blue shirt. He stretched out in his chair, and crossed his legs. Rubio speaks in careful, complete sentences, without the groping pauses common among those new to national politics. The only hint of nervousness came as we talked about immigration: his right foot started twitching up and down, like an accelerating metronome. I asked how he would persuade Hispanic voters that the Republican Presidential candidates are not anti-immigrant.\n\n\"Economic issues are predominant,\" he said. \"Republican policies are a lot better for that than the Democratic Party's. That's the fundamental issue. When we talk about rhetoric, particularly rhetoric around immigration, I've always said that our emphasis should be on the fact that we're in favor of legal immigration. And sometimes when the focus is on illegal immigration it creates the impression-unfairly, in many instances-that Republicans are against immigrants or against immigration.\" As long as unemployment is high, he said, he would not relax immigration restrictions. But, if it dropped, he would like to ease immigration laws for highly educated immigrants, political refugees, and agricultural workers. However, he opposes all forms of amnesty, because that would reward lawbreakers.\n\nWhen I asked him about the fence, he responded, \"That's a tactic,\" and, \"I'm not an expert on immigration tactics and how to enforce the law.\" If there were an effective immigration system, the need for such a fence \"diminishes over time,\" he said. \"I'm not against a fence. I'm not sure it solves all of our problems, either,\" particularly since \"a fence doesn't do anything\" to block the roughly forty per cent of illegal immigrants who come here on legal visas and then stay beyond their expiration. In response to a question about Arizona's stringent law, he said, \"Arizona had a constitutional right to pass that law. And it had a dramatic public-safety need, which is why the state passed it. I don't believe states should be in the business of doing that. I don't think Florida needs one of those laws.\" He favors a uniform national law but does not specify what it would entail.\n\nI asked if he agrees with analysts who say that winning more than thirty-five per cent of the Hispanic vote is crucial for a Republican victory this fall.\n\n\"I think that analyzes the wrong way,\" he said. \"First of all, it assumes the Hispanic voter is some sort of a voting bloc across the country, when in fact there's tremendous diversity. A lot of it is geographic.\" He added that Hispanics are well assimilated, and that \"this idea that immigration is the only issue that Hispanics care about is absurd.\"\n\nI cited speculation that he might join the 2012 Republican ticket, to which he responded, \"I'm not going to be the Vice-Presidential nominee.\"\n\nIs that to say you reject it?\n\n\"I do.\"\n\nWhen I pushed, he added, \"If I say I'm not going to do it, then I'm not going to accept it.\" (Several weeks after our interview, Sentinel announced that it would publish a memoir by Rubio next fall, which would be propitious timing for a Vice-Presidential nominee.)\n\nWhen we discussed Univision, Rubio strove to appear nonchalant, while dismissing the network's influence. \"I used to work there-they have good soap operas,\" he said. \"The idea that somehow voters of Hispanic descent somehow only watch a Spanish-speaking network is just not true. I think they get their news from everywhere. Just as we all do. Especially young voters.\" According to Nielsen ratings, though, nearly seventy per cent of Univision's eighteen-to-forty-nine-year-old viewers each night watch no other network. By contrast, less than ten per cent of the audience of NBC, ABC, CBS, and Fox watches only those stations.\n\nRubio waved away a question about his brother-in-law's conviction. \"It doesn't even merit discussion,\" he said. When I asked for a fuller explanation, he replied, \"I just don't think that's a valid news story that a news organization runs. I thought that was a tabloid news item. I don't deal with tabloids.\" He spoke calmly, but his right leg jiggled faster.\n\nBefore leaving, I mentioned that the two aides on the conference call with Univision had said that the network tried to shake them down, and asked if he agreed.\n\n\"I don't have anything to add.\"\n\nCould I see the notes that Alex Burgos took during the call?\n\nAfter I asked a second time, he said, \"It's fine.\"\n\nIf Univision did try to blackmail Rubio, there would be a simple explanation for the controversy this fall. Employees at the network might have heard about it and taken the story to the Miami Herald . The Herald might have got confirmation from Rubio's staff. After the story ran, the Republican Presidential candidates might have been genuinely outraged at Univision's yellow journalism and decided that they should not dignify the network with a debate.\n\nThis pristine explanation, however, is too simple. The notes of the conversation between Rubio's office and Univision don't provide a convincing case that Univision proposed dropping any mention of Senator Rubio's brother-in-law's criminal past if Rubio consented to an interview. They, and interviews with the people involved in the conflict, suggest that a complicated and politically risky game unfolded as the Republican Party shifted the date of the Florida primary. Rubio had every reason to want to punish Univision, and the national Republican Party had every reason to want to avoid holding a debate on a network that would ask aggressive questions about immigration. Both got what they desired, but perhaps at a cost.\n\nBurgos's notes from the July conference call with Univision are written in neat, small script on two pages of a flip notebook. The phone dialogue, mostly between Todd Harris and Isaac Lee, unfolds:\n\nT ODD : Don't understand rationale for doing story. Absurd.\n\nI SAAC : Just doing our job. . . .\n\nT ODD : Just because stories are interesting they don't turn into national news stories. Fair game if this were a current issue.\n\nThe notes eventually report that Lee said Univision would \"abandon this piece in favor of 'Al Punto,' \" but the next sentence contradicts this, saying that Lee made \"no promises.\" Later, Burgos writes a comment of his own: \"quid pro quo.\" But the notes also say that Lee said he would offer \"no guarantees\" to kill the story if Senator Rubio granted a full interview. The notes conclude with Burgos asking if the story might not run if Senator Rubio coöperated on a profile of his life or gave an interview on \"Al Punto.\"\n\nLee's response, Burgos writes, was \"Your interpretation is fair.\" Lee says, however, that he offered three Univision options: report a stand-alone news story on Orlando Cicilia; have Senator Rubio coöperate on a network profile; or have him be interviewed on Jorge Ramos's \"Al Punto.\" Whatever the venue, Lee says, the issue of Orlando Cicilia would have been raised.\n\nThe Herald portrayed the conversation as a shakedown; the notes suggest a contentious discussion. Furthermore, all six of the Univision employees on the call deny that there was any such offer and say they were not called. When I asked Manny Garcia, one of the article's co-authors, whether any of the \"Univision insiders\" he spoke to were among those six, at first he told me that the network wouldn't \"volunteer\" anyone on the call. He went on to say, \"The sources were just people with knowledge of the conversation\"-meaning that he hadn't talked to anyone on the call. Later, he said that he wouldn't discuss specific sources.\n\nAll the Univision news-department people on that call say that the Herald story was unfair, and have expressed pride in how Lee acted. \"I left the conference call feeling good, confident that we had conducted ourselves in the utmost professional manner,\" the managing editor, Maria Martinez-Henao, told me. At the end of the call, the news vice-president, Daniel Coronell, told me, the two lawyers \"applauded.\" Reyes, the reporter, said, \"If Isaac or Daniel decided to trade my story for an interview, I leave the room\" and, presumably, the company. Univision executives also ask whether, even if they were totally unethical, they would be so stupid as to try to blackmail Rubio staff members on a call with two company attorneys. And if Burgos was outraged by Lee's alleged \"quid pro quo,\" why did he not mention it in his e-mail to Lee the day after the call? When asked this question, Burgos declined to respond.\n\nThe Herald reporter Marc Caputo says that the tip for the story first came to the Herald \"from friends of Rubio.\" Caputo found the story credible in part because he thinks that Univision has become so partisan that it would be willing to cross journalistic lines to have the opportunity to grill Rubio on immigration. He said, in an e-mail, that the network \"has virtually crusaded on behalf of its viewership for the Dream Act,\" and that \"it's not tough to believe\" that the network would have \"essentially punished Rubio for not going along with the program.\"\n\nOne can fairly ask, as Caputo does, whether Univision crossed boundaries to hype its story. For example, soon after the story ran, a Univision reporter, reading from prepared notes, ambushed Florida's governor, Rick Scott, by asking, \"If something happened or they discovered something about your brother-in-law-this is a hypothetical case-would you resign?\"\n\nOne can also ask, as the Herald and Rubio do, whether Univision should have aired the story at all. It was pushing the limits of privacy and, though it can persuasively argue that Orlando Cicilia's arrest and his life might have had an influence on Rubio, the story produced no evidence that this was so or that Cicilia was instrumental in any of Rubio's campaigns. Still, Univision has a plausible response. \"We are not here to get into the private lives of people,\" Isaac Lee said. \"We don't look at who is having an affair with whom. But when you put together your nephew's participation in the campaign . . . and a family member who was part of a criminal organization, you really ought to know how that impacted\" Rubio's life.\n\nRegardless of where you come down, Presidential debates on prominent media outlets are not usually boycotted because of somewhat overhyped news stories or murky civic debates. It seems much more likely that boycotting a debate on Univision was a convenient way for the Republican candidates to appease Senator Rubio and, at the same time, avoid engaging in a debate on the eve of the Florida primary that would likely inflame Hispanics. And there's little question that a debate sponsored by Univision, which Republicans now seem to view the way Democrats view Fox, would have been much tougher than one sponsored by Telemundo.\n\nSenator Rubio is right that voters see the economy as the most pivotal issue of the campaign. A nationwide Univision poll this fall of a thousand Hispanic registered voters encouraged Republicans, because it revealed that only one in three \"strongly approves of the President,\" a lower level of support than Obama received in 2008. There was also, however, reason for Republicans to be frightened by the poll. Nearly two-thirds of those polled, when offered a hypothetical candidate whose economic policies they embraced \"but who used strong anti-immigrant rhetoric,\" said that \"the rhetoric would make them less likely to vote for that candidate.\" As with candidates perceived as anti-Israel by Jews, or racist by blacks, an anti-immigrant perception is toxic among Hispanics. A December poll from impreMedia and Latino Decisions revealed that seventy-three per cent of Hispanics believe that the Republican Party either doesn't \"care too much\" about Hispanics or is \"hostile\" to them.\n\nIt's also not clear that stringent immigration positions are preferred by non-Hispanics during a general election. A Univision poll this fall of a thousand Americans found that nearly sixty per cent of them, and fifty-three per cent of those identified as Republicans, favored \"a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\" Starting with the January 31st Florida primary, and then moving on to primaries in other states with substantial Hispanic populations-Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, California-immigration issues will be prominent. \"The Republican Party doesn't have a monolithic position,\" Steve Schmidt says, noting that the Republican governors of Nevada and New Mexico are Hispanic. But he worries that the Republican candidates for President who have spoken harshly about illegal immigrants will find it difficult to extract themselves from the box they've sealed themselves in.\n\nYet the candidates don't seem to be worried about the long-term consequences of the positions they've taken to win primaries. When I spoke with a top Romney strategist, he acknowledged that better communication with Hispanic voters is \"something I'm not immersed in at the moment.\" A prominent national Republican who did not want to be identified agreed with Schmidt. Taking a harsh stand against immigration, he says, \"is unbelievable shortsightedness,\" because it ignores a fundamental truth about elections: \"Issues are not how voters decide. It's what kind of a person they think the person is. They don't like people who they feel don't like them.\" Debating on Univision might have solidified those views, or it might have given the candidates a chance to truly ameliorate them.\n\nRepublicans speak of Senator Rubio as a Vice-Presidential candidate in large part because they think he can help deliver Hispanic voters. But it's not clear that he can. In the 2010 Senate election, he won fifty-five per cent of the Hispanic vote, but this was mostly because he won three-quarters of the Cuban vote. He won only about a third of the Puerto Rican vote and not much more of the remainder of the Hispanic vote. Jeb Bush, a Florida Republican with softer positions on immigration than Rubio-he has supported tuition breaks for the children of illegal immigrants, for example-won nearly two-thirds of the Hispanic vote in his last state-wide election, including fifty-five per cent of the Puerto Rican vote. In the December poll by impreMedia and Latino Decisions, only thirteen per cent of Hispanics said that Rubio's inclusion on the national ticket would make them much more likely to vote Republican; ten per cent said it would make them much less likely.\n\nRubio's potential appeal to immigrants who have struggled to become citizens probably wasn't helped when, in late October, the Washington Post and the St. Petersburg Times reported that, contrary to Rubio's claims, his parents were not \"exiles,\" who fled Cuba after Castro seized control, in January, 1959. They arrived on legal visas, three years earlier, when Fulgencio Batista was President. Since Rubio was not born until 1971, his telling of the story could be an honest mistake; or maybe it was just a bit of puffery on a résumé. Whatever the case, Rubio's battles with Univision, and his hard-line position on immigration, will not advance his popularity among Hispanics. Jorge Ramos asks a question that he undoubtedly would have asked Senator Rubio on \"Al Punto\": \"What would happen to his parents if they were to arrive today from a Latin-American country?\"\n\nRubio has a good tale to tell. His family struggled, and he has earned his success. A more experienced politician might have handled the July phone call to Barbara Cicilia very differently and coolly behaved like the humble son described by Rubio's mentor, Al Cardenas. Rubio could have described his brother-in-law's story as one of redemption, not shame. He could have said that Orlando Cicilia committed a crime and was properly punished for it. With the benefit of understanding, and family support, he was then able to emerge as a productive U.S. citizen. That, Rubio could have said, is a truly American story. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "After Decades in Prison, Edward Garry Is Finally Cleared of a Murder He Didn't Commit\n\nOn Monday, after deliberating for less than half an hour, a Bronx jury\nvindicated Edward Garry's twenty-three-year quest to clear his name,\nfinding him not guilty of the 1995 murder of a retired police detective\nnamed Oswald Potter. In 2016, I wrote about Garry's\ncase for The New Yorker . Garry was twenty years old when he was charged\nwith Potter's murder. Next week, Garry will turn forty-three. He spent\nhis twenties and all of his thirties in prison, and was only let out on\nbail last year after a judge ordered a new trial for him. One of Garry's\nlawyers, Glenn Garber, told me that, when the jury foreman read the new\nverdict, one of the jurors was crying, and afterward \"one of them ran up\nto him in the hallway and said, 'I'm sorry this happened to you,' and\nhugged him.\"\n\n\"It still feels like a dream,\" Garry said, when I talked to him Monday\nnight. \"It didn't register yet.\"\n\nThe Bronx district attorney's office chose to retry Garry despite\nserious flaws in its case and the fact that the campaign to clear his\nname had come to include one of the cops who originally helped arrest\nhim. When Darcel D. Clark, the Bronx D.A., took office, in 2016, she\nstarted a conviction-integrity unit to review questionable cases. The\nunit had examined Garry's case and had not come to a public conclusion,\nbut prosecutors still decided not to back down. (A spokeswoman for Clark\nsaid this week that the D.A.'s office does not comment on acquittals.)\n\nPotter's murder took place at Irene's New Hope Grocery, a store on\nLaconia Avenue that doubled as an illegal gambling parlor. Witnesses\ntold police that two men, one Hispanic and one black, had burst in to\nIrene's, demanding cash. After a scuffle, the Hispanic man killed\nPotter. A phalanx of cops, led in part by a rookie detective named Peter\nForcelli, worked on the case. Forcelli and other officers brought in the\nwitnesses to look at mug shots. Two picked out a photo of Garry, a\nneighborhood drug dealer who was in the mug-shot book because of a prior\nconviction for attempted robbery. Forcelli told me that back then, when\nthe city's murder rate was up, he considered two civilian witnesses\n\"golden.\" Thanks in part to Forcelli's work, Garry was convicted of\nPotter's murder and sentenced to twenty-five years to life.\n\nBut Garry always maintained his innocence, and he made five formal\nattempts to undo his conviction. Last spring, a Bronx Supreme Court\njudge found that the district attorney's office had violated Garry's\ndue-process rights during his original trial by not handing over\nevidence about another possible suspect. The judge, Michael A. Gross,\nordered a new trial for Garry.\n\nBy that point, there was ample evidence that Garry had not committed the\nmurder. In the original trial, both of the witnesses who had fingered\nGarry's mug shot had equivocated over their identifications, and there\nwas no other evidence tying Garry to the crime. In the mid-aughts, after\na defendant in a separate case-a man named Lawrence Broussard-confessed\nto being involved in the Potter holdup, federal prosecutors in Manhattan\nbegan an investigation into Garry's case. Eventually, the Manhattan U.S.\nAttorney's office found three men-Broussard and two getaway drivers-who\nadmitted to participating in the crime with a fourth assailant, who shot\nPotter. All three men said that the fourth man was not Edward Garry.\n\nGarry's lawyers-Garber and Rebecca Freedman, of the Exoneration\nInitiative, a Manhattan-based nonprofit-eventually found N.Y.P.D.\ndocuments showing that Steven Martinez, a man who looked similar to\nGarry, and who was committing crimes in the Bronx at the time of the\nmurder, and who told a street informant in the summer of 1995 that \"I\njust shot some guy on Laconia Avenue,\" had been considered as a suspect.\n(Martinez told me in 2016 that he was innocent.)\n\nForcelli left the N.Y.P.D. in 2001 to take a job with the Bureau of\nAlcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, where he now runs the Miami\nfield office. In the intervening years, he became something of a\nspecialist in unravelling wrongful convictions. Until he revisited\nGarry's case, he'd wondered how it felt to be a cop or an investigator\nwho got the wrong guy. Then, in 2014, Forcelli was called to testify in\nthe Bronx Supreme Court during one of Garry's challenges of his\nconviction. Garber, the lawyer, handed Forcelli a photo array that\nincluded Martinez, and Forcelli realized that Martinez and Garry,\nsitting in front of him at the defendant's table, were look-alikes. At\nthat moment, he said, he realized he'd arrested the wrong man.\n\nForcelli testified on Garry's behalf at hearings in 2015 and 2016,\ntrying to explain what went wrong in the investigation and trying to\nhelp Garry clear his name. As the hearings dragged on, Forcelli became\nincreasingly furious with a system that seemed unable to correct a\nmistake. Last week, Forcelli returned to court once more, this time as a\nwitness for Garry's defense. He hadn't been sure he'd be able to make it\nto New York, as he was recently treated for lung cancer. After he\nfinished testifying, he spoke to Garry.\n\n\"At the end, he shook my hand, and thanked me for being honest,\"\nForcelli told me. \"I said, 'Edward, do me a favor, and, if you get out\nand get your freedom back, do me a favor. Just make sure you do good\nthings with your life.' He said he would. I hope he does.\" Forcelli said\nhe's relieved that Garry has finally found justice. \"I feel like a ton\nof bricks has been lifted.\"\n\nGarry is now out of prison and has finally escaped the pursuit of the\nprosecutors in the Bronx. But he's spent almost all of his adult life in\na cell. Since he's been out on bail, he's been living with relatives in\nFlorida and Long Island, trying to figure out what to do and how to\nlive. During this trial, Garber said of Garry, \"he kind of put himself\nin this zone where he would walk away on the breaks, not socialize with\nanyone and keep his head down, which was, in a way, a good thing, but it\nwas very hard for him,\" Garber said. \"He's struggling and suffering a\nlot. I'm hoping this will lift another burden off of him.\" In 2016, when\nI interviewed Garry at Sing Sing prison, in New York's Hudson Valley, he\ntold me that he'd stopped exercising, and was taking his meals alone. \"I\nlost my life for something I had nothing to do with,\" he said.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "Busted in New York\n\nHow long had it been since I'd been out late on the Lower East Side? Back in the New Wave bohemian days of the late nineteen-seventies and early eighties, the Lower East Side was the capital of mischief. The low life was still literary. I could be persuaded to go anywhere in search of an authentic urban experience. But then my friends grew up, and I moved far away, as Europe seemed to me at the time. Because I don't drink and run wild anymore, because I now live down a dirt track in the English countryside, a Manhattan roomful of the young and the smooth can be intimidating.\n\nBut the reggae club the summer before last was known as a chill lounge. Rona let her hair hang over the beat. We were waiting for Billie. I was telling myself not to have a hard time waiting. I was looking forward to my session with that inner-child finder, marijuana. The reggae swelled around me. My head bobbed like a duck's when there's bread on the water. I saw what looked like a ballet dancer's leg. Billie, and a Billie who knew the score. Her opening drink would not take long. We were going to step outside. We couldn't smoke pot in this reggae club. Not even in a reggae club? That's how long it had been since I'd been out late on the Lower East Side.\n\nStreet lamps threw a spotlight over pedestrians crossing Second Avenue. Killer taxis left unpleasant gusts. I leaned into the summer heat. Soon we three were alone in the dark of Sixth Street. Rona checked behind her. Then, like backup singers on the downbeat, Billie and I snapped glances over our right shoulders. Maybe some people wouldn't have bothered, but we were pros. We were veterans of the streets. Rona fired one up, and passed it. We were chatting. I hogged it. We were drifting toward midnight. Billie handed it back to Rona. Three shapes in front of a doorway decided to heckle us. \"You're having a good time.\" They sounded like unappetizing old kids. We moved to the curb. \"We know what you're doing.\" Rona pushed her hand against the air to let them know that the joke, whatever it was, had to stop. \"Smoke it.\" We shook our heads at their being so boisterous when they were maybe getting high themselves, and in a doorway, of all places. We should have looked ahead instead of behind.\n\nWe saw the corner and we saw the big man in white-guy plaid shorts cutting a pigeon-toed diagonal from across the street. Everything about him was aimed toward us. His bright white sneakers continued to rise and fall in our direction. A huge meatpacking arm was held out to us, and a big voice was coming at us, too. His other arm came out of his undershirt with a square of ID. We had to keep moving toward him, like something swirling down a drain. There now seemed to be enough light for a film crew's night shoot. How could we have missed the blue unmarked van parked on the other side of Sixth Street?\n\n\"Been smoking something?\" No answer. \"Put your hands flat on the trunk of this car.\" The women, my friends, were side by side at the back of the car. I was on the sidewalk and had to bend over. Other undercovers quickly appeared. \"We're going to empty your pockets.\" A woman had taken up position behind Rona and Billie. I felt a hand go into my pocket. My total financial assets held by a faded money clip hit the trunk of the car. \"Did you all just meet tonight?\" a new voice demanded. \"No.\" My own voice was thin and completely lacking in the authority of outrage. The money clip was followed by a pack of menthol cigarettes, a disposable lighter, a case containing reading glasses, a John Coltrane-Johnny Hartman CD-\"You listen to some good music,\" a head of hair said-and a mobile phone. \"Where's your beeper?\" He patted me down. \"You got a beeper?\" \"No,\" came the thin reply.\n\nThe detectives murmured. They'd found the smallest stub of weed in a matchbook in Rona's pocket. The woman detective left. The detective with the hair asked the ladies to step over to the sidewalk. Where Plaid Shorts had, like me, the beginnings of his father's stomach, this one had pecs and biceps rolling out of a magenta tank top. He looked like a television actor in the role of maverick cop. The rest of him was in the suburban version of casual: crisp bluejeans and clean sneakers.\n\n\"So you guys just met tonight?\" Tank Top asked. It was my turn. He was going to compare answers. Plaid Shorts said he was going over to the van to check something. \"How do you know each other?\" Tank Top demanded. \"School.\" If he identified us as middle class, wouldn't he have to watch himself? Maybe I was trying to prick some white blue-collar resentment; anything to turn the tables a little. When he asked about my beeper, I thought maybe he hoped he'd interrupted something good, criminally speaking, such as a black dude giving two white chicks a taste of the street herb they were about to buy or get ripped off for. But if he saw that we were O.K., then the paperwork on the citation that they gave out in these cases would speed up. One black guy with gray in his beard and one and a half white girls, not two, because by that time they must have figured out that Billie's honey skin and the Asian cast to her eyes and her Church of England accent were some weird Caribbean story. Yes, Officer, I wanted to explain, the one with the henna highlights is a famous Jewish scientist, the daughter of the British Commonwealth is a banker, and I'm a black guy who needs two pairs of glasses and won't be on your computer lists, not even a credit rating.\n\nBillie and Rona had shown no emotion until Plaid Shorts brought the handcuffs. Then they gave out soft, pastel exclamations. Plaid Shorts led them, affronted and vulnerable, across the street to the side door of the van. I thought, Rona's daughter walks just like her. I felt my watch being removed. Tank Top put my arms behind me and pushed my hands high up my back. I felt the metal around my wrists. I thought of my parents and how they would hurl themselves into this if they found out. I felt and heard the handcuffs lock. I thought of my parents and their lawsuits. Back in the good old days, they'd sued our home-town police department to force it to desegregate, and when that worked they sued the fire department-things they did in their spare time, as good citizens, as blacks of their generation, members of the N.A.A.C.P. rank and file. Injustice had only to ring their doorbell, and they were off to the poorhouse. And here was frivolous me letting a white man put me in handcuffs for something other than protest. I remembered what my father had said to my tears at my sister's memorial, the year before: Keep it together.\n\nBut I was in shock. \"I'm going to be sick.\" I was starting to list from side to side. \"Have you been drinking?\" \"No.\" I was going deaf. \"I'm going to pass out.\" Tank Top gripped me just below my right armpit, and we started off, but my feet waited before they followed my legs. The world broke into silent, colorful particles. I got to the door and fell flat into the van. Rona's face floated. I began to hear her. I concentrated on finding her face in one place, something I could get up for and move toward, even if only on my knees. \"Don't hurt him,\" Rona and Billie called. \"I'm trying to help him,\" Tank Top countered.\n\nKeep it together, I chanted to myself. Not because I was a black man in handcuffs in front of two white guys; not because I was powerless, which made it all the more necessary at least to imitate the examples of dignity in confrontations with police which I'd witnessed; and not because I was a grown man losing it in front of two women who, though in handcuffs, were trying to defend me. But because they were my friends. They were the ones with children at home. I crawled over to my friends in the seatless, windowless rear of the van, dripping sweat on them.\n\nPlaid Shorts yanked the van into the street. Because we couldn't grab, and there was nothing to grab on to, we rolled into Alice-down-the-rabbit-hole positions, and rolled again when Plaid Shorts hit the gas. \"This is such bullshit,\" Billie said to the ceiling. \"This sucks,\" Plaid Shorts said. But he wasn't talking to us. He looked across to Tank Top. \"You got that right.\" \"A big one,\" Plaid Shorts added. \"Hate it,\" Tank Top said to his window. \"Total bullshit.\" Rona had dusted off her repertoire of apt facial expressions. This one said, \"Are these guys for real?\" \"Five more years, man, and then I'm out,\" Plaid Shorts said. \"I can't wait to just do my band.\" He did a near wheelie around a corner. We shouldered back up into sitting positions pretty expertly after two corners. Tank Top took some gum from the dashboard and said he had to keep at this bullshit until he could pay off his wife. He told Plaid Shorts that instead of alimony he was offering his wife a once-in-a-lifetime, can't-refuse lump sum. \"It's like a buyout.\"\n\nThe acid-driven power chords of Pink Floyd took over the van. Rona's expression said, \"These guys are too much.\" \"They're wild,\" Billie's eyes said back as she looked for the place behind her where the music was blaring from. Maybe the detectives were trying to tell us something. Not that they were nice guys who regrettably had to do their job but that they were better than the job they'd been reduced to doing, and that they, too, had aspirations. The Rolling Stones came on next, and Plaid Shorts sang along. The music was perhaps meant to say that they weren't uncool, redneck cops having a blast at the expense of the liberal, the black, and the in-between.\n\nI was too ashamed to be sympathetic. Being addressed as \"sir\" by Tank Top only after I had shown weakness and fear-that was humiliating. A cop could go off at any time. I'd thought of that and had been afraid, and there was no way to take it back. And for what had I lost my self-respect? For an offense the detectives thought beneath their training. What did you do last night? Oh, I was picked up for a reefer and I fainted like a man. The van went up one street and down another. We couldn't see much, but most likely we were driving around and around as various undercover operations didn't work out. On one dark corner we waited so long in the van by ourselves that we almost slept.\n\nThe van door slid open, and in the shaft of light Tank Top was helping a Hispanic woman, maybe in her fifties, climb aboard the bummer bus. \"Hey, Officer,\" she said when we were under way. \"My hands too hot.\" The detectives parked and helped Rona and Billie out. Tank Top said, \"I'm going to loosen these tight cuffs, like you asked.\" Then he turned off the lights, slammed the door, and left me with this woman who made unsavory sounds in the dark. I thought she was trying to ditch her vials of crack and the detectives would then claim that they were mine. I went over on my side, practicing the I-was-asleep defense. They put Rona and Billie back in the van, turned on the lights, drove off, stopped again, and got out by themselves. As soon as the doors closed, the Hispanic woman, who'd freed her hands, whipped out a big bag of heroin, snorted it on her knee, and deftly worked her hands back into the cuffs. Rona was laughing in disbelief. Quietly, the Hispanic woman zoned sidewise. The detectives, when they got back in, firmly looked straight ahead.\n\nThe next time the van door opened, a Hispanic man, maybe also in his fifties, climbed in. A dark Rasta youth was pushed in after him. \"Ooh,\" the Hispanic guy said, and tried to shift himself. He nodded greetings of solidarity. What he'd been oohing about hit Rona's hygiene radar first. It made delicate Billie draw in her legs. The gleaming Rasta youth sprawled before us had matted dreadlocks that looked like what comes from the back of a furnace when its filter is changed. Maybe I should have thought harder about this being someone's son, but the stench was overpowering. Meanwhile, he kept up a stream of Babylon raas claat denunciations of the police. He shouted curses on the white man. I thought, Rasta, my brother in Garvey, you are on your own. The detectives paid him no mind. They'd made their quota for the shift.\n\nWe'd been smoking a joint right around the corner from the local precinct house, that's how hip we were. The detectives took us inside and the handcuffs came off. After three hours, it was a relief to see my fingers. Tank Top took me and the Rasta youth upstairs to a grotty corridor, and the strip search began. He made the Rasta youth wait in the shadows at the end. He ordered me to hand him my clothes item by item. I was to turn around, bend over, and drop my shorts. He said quickly that that was enough. I was to take off my socks and turn them inside out. \"Get dressed.\" He asked if I'd ever been arrested. No. He said he would try to tell me what was going to happen. I thought I understood. He motioned to the Rasta and sent me downstairs. He and the Rasta followed moments later. Tank Top had returned my property, except for the phone and the CD. Such stuff had to go over to the lockup at Central, he explained. If that was the case, then the Rasta youth had a prayer shawl and a Torah for Central to deal with. Tank Top tried to talk when he took my fingerprints. \"So what kind of things do you write?\" After that, he had paperwork to finish. Now and then, he would dial a telephone number, mutter, hang up, and shrug. A clock kept vigil over a wall of \"Most Wanted\" leaflets.\n\nWhen Plaid Shorts announced that we were moving, around five o'clock in the morning, the Hispanic man asked how much money I had on me. I'd covered the money clip with my hand when Tank Top passed it to me, but, clearly, I hadn't been quick enough. The Hispanic man said I couldn't bring in anything where we were going, because it would get taken off me. He informed Plaid Shorts, who agreed that I'd get robbed. Rona put my belongings, even my glasses, in her pocket. My property would be safer in the women's section, the Hispanic man advised as we were put back into handcuffs and then linked to one another. I was made to lead our daisy chain of handcuffs through the precinct's main room. As Plaid Shorts increased the pace, two officers by the front door erupted into grunting song. \"Working on the chain gang, uh.\"\n\nWe hopped out of the van into a street that was still dark. A semicircle of light waited for us to approach. This was the Tombs, that place I'd heard about, read about. Two more daisy chains of prisoners joined ours as Tank Top, having rung twice, banged on the metal grating over the entrance. It rolled up. Plaid Shorts and Tank Top surrendered us in a series of rapid clipboard signatures. When I realized that they intended to abandon us at this concrete threshold, I wanted to ask them when they planned to read us our rights. I'd begun to think of them as our undercovers. They were responsible for us. But they were gone, and we were across the line, and the metal grating was coming down.\n\nI followed a black female corrections officer's rump up some stairs. A black male corrections officer unhooked everybody. My eyes stayed on Rona and Billie when they were ordered to move to the other side of the corridor. The women went in one direction, the men in another. Green bars streamed along either side of me as I hurried both to keep up with the corrections officer who was now taking us down to the basement and to keep ahead of someone whose footsteps menaced my heels.\n\nThe Rasta youth and I were directed into the last cell of the long jail. I insinuated myself onto the narrow metal bench that went from the bars of the cell to the rear wall, where it made a right angle toward the partition that hid the toilet. Nine mute, tired faces emphasized how cramped and stuffy the tiny cell was. One man was curled up asleep under the bench.\n\nI didn't want to look too intently at the other men in judicial storage, in case to do so meant something I could not handle the consequences of. I also didn't want to look away too quickly when my gaze happened to meet someone else's. However, no one was interested in hassling the new arrivals. Men were waking up, and their banter competed with the locker-room-type noise coming from the corrections officers' oblong station desk. A short white girl with thick glasses and a rolling lectern called my name. She said the interview was to determine who was eligible for bail, but the questions also separated the wheat from the chaff, socioeconomically speaking. Some guys probably had no job, no taxable weekly income, no address, no mother's address. She lost patience with the Rasta youth's decent background. \"Education? How far did you get in school?\" A community-college degree. Her head was tilted up toward the spectacle of his hair. \"We'll say grade fifteen.\"\n\nSome time later, the Rasta youth and I were summoned again. But again we were going only a few yards. A black corrections officer shooed aside someone blocking the door of the new cell, which was large and, sneaked glances told me, held some huge dudes. Fresh apprehension was bringing my body to something like exocrine parity with the Rasta youth's. I didn't know what to expect, and so tried to prepare for the worst. We were shoulder to shoulder on a metal bench, like crows shuffling on a telephone wire. The move to this restless population had to be the final, dangerous descent, the reason I'd crammed my watch into my glasses case and handed everything off to Rona.\n\nA black youth with his hair in tight break braids called out to a new arrival, my Hispanic comrade. \"Come on in.\" The black youth's knuckles looked as big as Mike Tyson's. \"They took the murderers out early.\" He slapped five with a couple of his hulking neighbors and concerned himself with what he could see of his reflection in the metal bench between his thighs. He said something more. I didn't hear what it was, but it must have been wicked.\n\nA black corrections officer reversed himself and glared through the green bars. \"What?\" \"Nothing, Mo,\" the black youth said loudly, evenly. Only one of his neighbors giggled. \"Say what, chump?\" He was going for the keys at his hip. \"You say something?\" He was so agitated that he couldn't get the key in. He was as tall as a basketball power forward. Everything he said was a variation of \"You want to say something?\" The cell door flew open, and in a few steps the corrections officer was over the massive head of twinkling break braids. \"A real man would say something now.\" He waited for an answer. I could see him shaking. The black youth wasn't going to feed him any lines or provocation. The corrections officer pivoted toward the door. He had a baton on his belt, but no gun. He made a satisfied noise with his keys.\n\nIt was not an impressive performance. I knew that. The corrections officer hadn't come up with any good lines. He just kept repeating himself. I could tell that all twenty-four of my cellmates were thinking how off the hook the corrections officer had been to raise up-the lingo was coming to me-on somebody like that. I was getting excited, feeling that I was on the verge of bonding with the other guys in our high and hip judgment against the corrections officer. He didn't meet our rigorous standards when it came to \"reading\" someone in the street manner. The black youth with the oiled, sparkling braids delivered our verdict: \"Definitely bugging behind something.\"\n\nThe black corrections officer flung the metal door so hard it bounced against the cell bars and rode back some. Giant steps put him in a place that blocked my view of the black youth. Spit was dancing from his head, pinwheel fashion, as he roared, \"If I started to kick your black ass now, where would your black ass be next week?\" I couldn't remember when I'd seen such sudden rage. It stopped all other activity in the basement. The tendons in his neck were ready to explode. I couldn't begin to think what his nostrils might be doing. Maybe our survival molecules were not the only ones to have been put on alert. Some of his colleagues had come by to monitor the situation. They turned back in a way that indicated they'd respect some code not to interfere. The cell was very still as the corrections officer made his exit. The street judgment was in the silence. Nobody wanted to look at him until he'd turned the lock. He'd made his point. He'd shown how dangerous was his longing to have a reason to lose control.\n\nThe corrections officer's brown skin looked glazed, as though it had been fired in a kiln. He didn't seem to know how to finish his scene and stood wheezing by the bars. I almost thought he was going to mellow into the dispersal-of-balm-and-poultice phase of tough love. The mask of the shock-tactics practitioner would drop. He'd apologize, give advice, tell the young brothers how he was once on his way to being where they were. The black corrections officer said, \"Remember. I'll be going home at four o'clock. You'll still be here. You're in jail. I'm not.\" Maybe I should have taken into account the possibility that he had seen and had a lot of trouble doing his job. Maybe he and the black youth already had a story going and I'd missed what started it. But that didn't matter. Only what he'd said about four o'clock mattered. It wasn't even nine o'clock in the morning yet. My Hispanic comrade was looking at me. He took his eyes heavenward and clasped his hands. Then he shot me an inaudible laugh.\n\nJail was going to get me over my fear of saying the obvious, because there was no way to ignore all morning the fact that everyone in the cell was either black or Hispanic. The irony, for me, was that an all-black gathering usually meant a special event, a stirring occasion. I thought back to some black guys I used to know who enjoyed telling me that black guys like me ought to hang out with black groups like theirs. It flattered me to believe that I flattered them with my yearning for instruction in the art of how to be down with it. But this was not what they had in mind. The mood in the cell was like that of an emergency room in a city hospital: a mixture of squalor, panic, boredom, and resentment at the supposed randomness of bad luck.\n\nSome guys, the Rasta youth among them, had elected to slip down onto the concrete floor. They were opting out of consciousness. Our cell had no television, no radio, no newspapers. There was a water fountain, a disgusting toilet, and two pay phones from which collect calls could be made. I don't know how those guys knew when the corrections officers had their backs turned, or how they'd held on to the contraband of drugs and matches they'd been thoroughly searched for, or how they knew who in which cell had what, but at one moment, as if by secret signal, paraphernalia went flying through green bars from cell to cell. The next thing I knew, guys were taking turns smoking crack behind the waist-high partition of the raised open toilet of our cell. Right there in the Tombs. I guess they figured there was no chance of the crack outsmelling the toilet. I'd switched seats and, as a result, was too near the burning funk. I saw my Hispanic comrade casually walk away from the hot spot, and soon I, too, got up and crossed the cell. His look of approval after I'd eased in somewhere else told me that I'd made the right move.\n\nA black guy with broken teeth, dressed in a torn car coat, emerged from behind the toilet. He ambled around and then seized the floor. \"You remember Lucky Lou Diamond? I had twenty thousand dollar over to Jersey City.\" I tuned in, eager for a jailhouse Richard Pryor who could turn the cell into something else. \"Nineteen-seventy-five? Bunny hat on my head? Your Honor. There's no mouth on the girl he touched.\" His free association promised much, but it gutter-balled into such incoherence that the black youth with break braids spoke for everyone when he barked, \"Sit down.\"\n\nIt was quiet for a while, but then the Rasta youth snapped to attention. Something jerked him to his feet and set him standing squarely in front of the cell door, his right knee pounding out a steady rhythm. I thought, Just when things were manageable, my brother in Selassie has to flip out. I braced myself for his rap. But he was ready for his lunch. He was first in the line we were commanded to make; first to march out of the cell toward stacks of chalk-colored squares on long, low trolleys that looked like what bricks are transported on at a building site. We were to pick up a sandwich, turn, take a plastic cup of grape juice from another low trolley, and then march back to the cell.\n\nA black guy in an orange jumpsuit-a trusty-called after me to let me know that I'd missed my allotted sandwich. Something about being urged to march rendered me unable to lift anything other than a cup of juice. Very soon the cell was strewn with sandwich remnants. Leaking sachets of mustard and mayonnaise found their way under the bench. A wedge of cheese crowned one of the pay phones. Lunch added to the odors of incarceration. However, there was plenty of room, because some of the men whose size so alarmed me when I first entered the cell had dived to the floor. I counted nine guys asleep in the grime, six of them in the fetal position, their wrists between their knees. Heads had to loll down some broad shoulders before they could touch concrete. A young, crack-thin guy woke and, using his palms for locomotion, crawled along on his stomach to the trash can, where he reached up to extract sandwich remains.\n\nI overheard some of the guys say a little while later that the police had arrested so many people in the sweep of the previous evening that two special night courts had been set up to process the haul. They would start to call names at four o'clock. Waiting might have been easier had there been no clock. At the appointed hour, the only official movement came from the black corrections officer who'd flipped out that morning. I'm sorry to report that he went through all the transparent maneuvers of rubbing it in. He paraded by us on his way back to the oblong station desk, ostensibly laughing at himself for forgetting something. And, just in case the black youth with break braids was pretending to take no notice of him, the corrections officer brought over a white officer holding a clipboard and pointed at the youth. His colleague tapped him a Have-a-good-night. \"I told you when you got here not to give me problems.\" The black youth looked toward the bars at last, his arms hugging his chest. The black corrections officer flicked a salute.\n\n\"Yo, Pops,\" I heard the black youth say once the air had calmed down again around us. \"Pops,\" he called again in my direction. I couldn't believe that he was talking to me. Pops? Everybody in the cell who spoke to someone he didn't know said, \"Yo, G.\" I pointed to myself. Who, me? \"Mind my asking what you're in for?\" I made a smoking gesture with two fingers of my right hand. \"Uh-huh. You dress Italian. But.\" A neighbor of his wanted to give him five for that observation, but he just looked at him hard. It was true. The soundtrack of brotherhood in my head was nearly all Marvin Gaye. It had finally happened: I was older than a cartoon father on television. I was older than Homer Simpson.\n\nI wasn't sure if Old Four Eyes in the Robert Hayden poem fled to \"danger in the safety zones\" or to \"safety in the danger zones.\" It was important to me, sitting there in my concrete elsewhere, which seemed dirtier and dimmer the longer I had to wait.\n\nAs the cell emptied, it got eerier. The few new guys, dressed in their garrulous night selves, were out of sympathy with the general tone of exhaustion and passivity. One new guy ranted about calling his girlfriend to tell her to hook up a plane to Canada, because after he made bail he was going to step off, boy. Another, the lone white, clung to a pay phone. He suggested to a friend that they deceive his brother-in-law. \"Don't tell him it's for me.\" He could press telephone numbers with amazing speed. He insisted to the next friend that she had to get the bail money out of her mother, because he could not, he said, shooting his eyes across us, the nonwhite, do Rikers.\n\nMy name was called, the cell door gapped open, and I floated out. Neither my Hispanic comrade nor the Rasta youth followed. I regretted that I would not have the chance to thank the man who had watched my back. Very soon I found myself upstairs in a new cell that had an iron-lattice screen. Beyond it was the outside world. I heard the voices of what I supposed were women corrections officers, and then over the walls I heard Billie and Rona in their interview cells. They heard me, we heard one another. The public defender on the free persons' side of the barrier was a heavyset white woman. She went from cubicle to cubicle, guiding us toward a plea: Adjournment in Contemplation of Dismissal, or A.C.D. If we didn't get picked up for the same offense within a twelve-month period, then the charge would be dropped. A.C.D.\n\nI told the P.D. that I'd used the pay phones. I knew that that afternoon a friend of mine had come zooming down with newspapers and a criminal lawyer and had been denied access. She said they were entitled to hold us for at least twenty-four hours before they had to do anything with us. I said that being in custody was the punishment. I said prosecution of so-called quality-of-life crimes was a form of harassment. She explained that under the circumstances they didn't have to read us our rights. I was about to compare such offenses to civil disobedience, but the last thing this calm and capable P.D. was interested in was anybody's vanity. She said that high arrest figures justified the large increase in the number of police on the streets. It was that simple.\n\nIn the courtroom, I felt as though we were guest speakers at a high school, the offenders with us behind the court recorder looked so tadpole, so young. We stood when the judge entered. \"He's not that kind of judge,\" a black bailiff said. Maybe because I was minutes and a plea away from getting out, tenderness got the better of me. I thought of my older sister and her practice in defense of juvenile offenders valiantly conducted from files in shopping bags in the trunk of her car. Our case was called, and we sat some rows back from the attorneys' desks, where we were unable to hear the grim P.D., even if we could have concentrated enough.\n\nGod bless the old-hippie souls who still believed in public life and social responsibility, I thought, but the P.D. had no time for effusive thanks. I'd been so hypnotized by green bars that the marble floor outside the courtroom was dazzling. The white clerks behind the counter in a payment-and-records office were accustomed to a stressed-out public and were rude back. Down in the lobby, Rona and Billie ran for the door marked \"Women.\" I rushed over to a rickety blue booth for my fix of those former slave crops-tobacco, sugar, coffee.\n\nPerhaps our elation on Rona's rooftop was unearned, but we felt like released hostages. We made jokes as soon as we had an audience of friends. Even the squalid bits, when told the right way, got laughs. Maybe we were defending ourselves against our deeper reactions to what had happened to us. Rona's husband said that now that his little boy was old enough to play in the street he had had to tell him what to do should the police ever stop him. Don't move; do exactly what they say; take no chances; give no lip. We wondered how popular these sweeps would be after some more white people had been caught in the net.\n\nWe'd been abruptly deprived of our liberty, and that would always make for a chilling memory. And as I'd learned sitting in the cell with all those guys whose stories I didn't know and couldn't ask for: the system exists, the system-for the nonwhite young, the poor-is real. New arrest records had been created, but we were out, and friends were standing in wreaths of smoke, savoring the night view of fire escapes, water tanks, and lights in distant windows.\n\nSix days after my release, I was back on the Lower East Side. I understood what Rona meant when she said that she fell in love with New York the day she realized that she could get a candy bar on every corner. But jail worked, it won. I thought, I'm not doing that again. The romance was over. For me, the changes in the streets went with everything else. Once upon a time, people moved to New York to become New Yorkers. Then people moved to New York and thought it perfectly O.K. to remain themselves. Goodbye, Frank O'Hara.\n\n\"Yo, Papi,\" I heard. I was astonished. It was my Hispanic comrade. They'd given him five days on Rikers Island for possession of a crack pipe. He was selling vinyl records on the sidewalk before he got moved off that bit of Second Avenue. Could I help him out? It would be my privilege. He said he remembered what the black youth with break braids had said when they took him out of that cell in the Tombs. \"Kidnapped by the Mayor, y'all.\" ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "An Ex-Cop's Remorse\n\nA couple of times a year, Peter Forcelli, a former New York Police Department detective who now works as a federal investigator in Florida, returns to the city to testify in court cases. The night before his appearances, he often heads to El Rio Grande, a midtown Tex-Mex restaurant, where he and former N.Y.P.D. colleagues trade stories about their days on the force. Forcelli, who is fifty-one, worked in the Bronx during some of the most violent years of the nineteen-nineties, before he left for a job with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. As a federal agent, Forcelli has found himself developing an unusual specialty: reinvestigating cases that were considered solved and uncovering evidence to free people imprisoned for crimes they didn't commit. His view of this work is uncompromising, even a little heroic, colored by the cop dramas he watched growing up, and his determination to expose flawed tactics and shoddy work has aroused the anger of officers and prosecutors.\n\nLast year, a hundred and fifty-seven people nationwide were exonerated-a record number. Amid growing awareness of the scope of the problem, the National Registry of Exonerations has gathered data on wrongful convictions going back to 1989, logging nearly two thousand exonerations, and the number is only a fraction of the convictions that are now being contested on the ground of innocence. In the popular imagination, blame for wrongful convictions falls on individuals: the racist prosecutor, the crooked cop. Although such cases do occur, Forcelli has come to believe that the problem is more fundamental-that the workings of the criminal-justice system itself have led even conscientious prosecutors, judges, and juries to put innocent people in prison.\n\nOn a visit to the city in October, 2014, Forcelli went to the Bronx Supreme Court to testify in a hearing relating to a case from 1995, in which a young man named Edward Garry had been convicted of killing a retired N.Y.P.D. detective in a holdup at a grocery. The conviction was based on testimony from two eyewitnesses, but Garry had always maintained his innocence, and the hearing was part of his fifth formal plea for exculpation. As Forcelli sat in the witness box, he was increasingly uneasy. Garry's case seemed to be one of those in which everyone did what they were supposed to do, but something had gone wrong, costing an apparently innocent man twenty years of his life. One thing made the case especially unsettling: Forcelli himself had helped arrest Garry. \"When I sat in the chair and I looked at Garry, I had this horrible, sinking feeling that I knew exactly what happened,\" Forcelli told me. \"That kick-in-the-chest feeling I had hasn't gone away since.\"\n\nForcelli grew up in Bedford Park, in the Bronx. His was one of the few white families on the block. His father was a construction worker, and jobs were sporadic; sometimes the family ate Cheerios for dinner. Money problems drove the family to move in with his dad's parents, in South Yonkers-fourteen family members from three generations, all crammed into one house. Forcelli always knew that he wanted to become a policeman. He took the entrance test for the N.Y.P.D. at sixteen, four years before he was eligible to join the force, and finished high school and worked as a carpenter until he could apply.\n\nIn 1986, at the age of twenty, he became a housing officer, and was assigned to patrol projects in the East Bronx. It was during the crack-cocaine epidemic, and that year there were more than sixteen hundred murders in the city, almost five times the number today. But Forcelli took to the work immediately. When he saw children heading to school or celebrating birthdays, they reminded him of the kids he grew up with, and he was shocked by the attitude of some of his colleagues. \"You see this 'Ah, people in the projects, they're all animals,' \" he said. He soon gained a reputation for investigating crimes until there was nothing left to investigate, and his superiors found him driven and outspoken. \"He wasn't afraid to let you know if he thought there was a better way to do things,\" one of them recalled.\n\nForcelli has always been obsessive about his work. He doesn't follow sports, or music, or politics, and is dreading mandatory retirement, when he turns fifty-seven. When I visited him at his A.T.F. office, in Miami, I noticed that the pens and papers on his desk were arranged with a precision bordering on the fanatical. He wears a dark suit to work almost every day. (Occasionally, he permits himself a palm-covered Tommy Bahama shirt, a taste he attributes to watching too much \"Magnum, P.I.\" as a kid.) He refers to crime victims respectfully, using \"Mr.\" or \"Mrs.,\" and can precisely recall crime-scene addresses from decades ago. Early in his career, his office was next to an interrogation room, on one side of a two-way mirror; as he ate his lunch, he would study the techniques that seasoned detectives used in questioning suspects. After he married, in his late twenties, his wife, Noreen, whom he'd met at a police fund-raiser, would bring him clothes and food as he worked double and triple shifts.\n\nIn 1995, Forcelli was promoted to detective and assigned to the N.Y.P.D.'s Forty-seventh Precinct, which stretches from Woodlawn Cemetery, in the western part of the Bronx, to the New York State Thruway, in the east. Its main roads are flanked by malnourished trees and low-rise buildings with faded awnings-storefront churches, transmission-repair shops, dollar stores. The year that Forcelli began working there, the precinct was the city's most dangerous, with more murders than anywhere else in the five boroughs. Almost every day, officers were confronted with knifings, shootings, disembowelments, and \"dump jobs\"-bodies that showed up in parks or rivers. Three weeks into the job, he got his first fresh case as a detective, the murder of a retired cop named Oswald Potter.\n\nThe murder took place at Irene's New Hope Grocery, which occupied a small corner building on Laconia Avenue. The front room of Irene's was an ordinary grocery, but tucked in a parlor behind it was an illegal gambling den. Men gathered nightly to drink beer and play dominoes or the numbers game (a kind of unofficial lottery). In the early evening of August 18th, four regulars were playing dominoes around a table. Gladys Garcia, a clerk who oversaw the gambling operation, and Oswald Potter were looking on. Potter, who was sixty-two, had retired as an N.Y.P.D. detective in 1982, after twenty-five years working in the Bronx.\n\nAt 6:20 P.M ., a man burst through the door to the back room. \"This is a stickup!\" he shouted, waving a gun. \"Everybody down!\" Another armed man followed him. Several things happened almost simultaneously: the men playing dominoes dived under the table; the first man handed Garcia a plastic bag and told her to fill it with cash; and Potter yelled, \"I'm a police officer!\" Potter knocked the second man to the floor, and made a grab for his gun. Garcia saw him run into the front of the grocery, pursued by the first man, and then lost sight of them. Soon afterward, she recalled, \"I heard a lot of shots.\"\n\nDuring the incident, Antonio Vargas, a college student who was helping his father make a soda delivery to Irene's, was sitting in a truck outside. First, he saw two men get out of a car and walk into the store. He heard a gunshot, and then saw the store's owner run out. Then there were more gunshots, the two men ran out to their car and drove off. \"That motherfucker shot me,\" he heard one of them say.\n\nWhen the police arrived, they found Potter collapsed in his car, parked in front of the store, his gun in his hand. He was taken to the hospital and died at 7:20 P.M., of a single gunshot wound to the chest.\n\nThe murder of a former cop electrified the Forty-seventh Precinct. The next morning, phones rang constantly as Potter's former colleagues called in for updates. The N.Y.P.D. threw all its resources behind the investigation, putting some forty officers, including Forcelli, on the case. (For most murders, two was the norm.) The pressure to make an arrest was intense. Not only had Potter been on the force; William J. Bratton, the police commissioner, had recently introduced a system called CompStat, which collected crime statistics in order to evaluate precincts' success rates in solving cases. Detectives had to file a form confirming the arrest-and closing the case, as far as CompStat was concerned-as quickly as possible. Usually, they had only three days to investigate a murder before they were assigned to something else. The relentless emphasis on speed led some to cut corners.\n\nIn the days following the murder, the police knocked on more than five hundred doors near the grocery, checked hospitals for gunshot-wound patients, obtained phone records and 911 tapes, and combed police records for other robberies in the area. But they didn't find much, and a forensic examination of the crime scene turned up nothing useful. Eyewitnesses' descriptions of the perpetrators varied: two male Hispanics; two male Hispanics and a woman with bleached-blond hair; two male Hispanics and a black male; four male Hispanics; two black males. Descriptions of the getaway car included a dark-blue Oldsmobile Delta 88, a black van, a light-blue four-door, and a black Ford Escort hatchback.\n\nInvestigators decided that the most reliable witnesses were Garcia and Vargas. Both described the first man, who had pursued Potter and presumably shot him, as Hispanic. The second man, whom Potter had pushed to the ground, had darker skin. They were able to give full descriptions of the lighter-skinned man, though their accounts differed. (Garcia said he was clean-shaven, and wore a white shirt and a white windbreaker; Vargas recalled a man with facial hair, wearing a red-white-and-blue shirt.) At the precinct, Garcia was shown a selection of mug shots, and she picked out a likeness that she thought was the gunman's. She wasn't positive at first, but gradually became more confident. Vargas chose a photograph, too, but said he wasn't sure. Despite these doubts, officers were thrilled. Both witnesses had picked the same man: Edward Garry.\n\nGarry, nicknamed Peanut, was twenty years old. He'd grown up in the Boston Secor Houses, in the Forty-seventh Precinct. His father worked in construction, his mother was a health aide, and some of his relatives were police officers. But there were troubles, too: his father became addicted to cocaine, and his parents split up for a year. At around sixteen, he dropped out of high school, joined a gang, and began selling drugs to pay for Dr. Martens and nights at Manhattan clubs. He was arrested a few times and spent a year on Rikers Island. Because of these arrests, Garry's mug shot was in police files, and it was among those shown to Vargas and Garcia because Garry matched their descriptions of a Hispanic man (his mother is Puerto Rican).\n\nAfter the initial identification, Forcelli and his colleagues placed Garry in a six-person lineup; Garcia and Vargas both picked him again. The officers were relieved to have solved a high-profile case so quickly, though they didn't have a confession, any physical evidence connecting Garry to the crime, or any information placing him near Irene's the night of the murder. \"Back then, identification was like the gold standard,\" Forcelli told me. \"If you could get a non-crackhead, non-prostitute witness to I.D., it's, like, whoa.\"\n\nGarry was immediately arrested for Oswald Potter's murder. Four days later, the lead detective on the case, George Milian, signed a form officially closing it. Sometime later, a photograph in a detectives'-union publication showed Milian and Forcelli receiving Detective of the Month honors for their work.\n\nGarry's trial took place in 1997. In addition to Garcia and Vargas, prosecutors called as a witness a jailhouse informant, who claimed that Garry had told him that he'd committed a murder. (The informant had said the same about at least eight other people and later recanted almost all these statements, including the one about Garry.) Garry had a court-appointed lawyer, who defended him ably, undercutting the informant's testimony and pointing out inconsistencies in the witnesses' identifications. But the prosecutor was effective, too, and cast doubt on an alibi that Garry had given, that he was at home with his parents that night. The jury found Garry guilty of second-degree murder, and he received a sentence of twenty-five years to life.\n\nBy 2000, Forcelli had begun to have serious doubts about the work he was doing at the N.Y.P.D. He hated having to abandon an investigation the moment an arrest was made. \"A lot of facts come out after the arrest,\" he told me. He preferred the methods of federal agents, who didn't consider their cases closed until pleas were entered or trials took place, and applied to join the A.T.F. He started there in June, 2001, and has worked for the bureau ever since, in Phoenix, Washington, and Toronto, before arriving in Miami. His first posting was at the A.T.F.'s New York offices, at Six World Trade Center. He had been in his job only a few months when the September 11th attacks occurred, and was parking his car at the office just before the second plane hit. The car was crushed, and Forcelli returned home covered in ash. He spent the next several months sifting through the debris pile at Ground Zero as part of the recovery effort. One day, someone found a pair of handcuffs that had been in his car-a present from his father when he joined the police force.\n\nMuch of Forcelli's new job involved working with so-called coöperators-defendants who, in return for lighter sentences, give federal prosecutors information not only on their own case but on everything they know about any criminal activity. In 2006, through a coöperator, Forcelli had his first insight into how wrongful convictions can occur. The crime was a drug-related contract killing that took place four years earlier. Bronx prosecutors had charged a man named Lacey Little, who had been in jail for almost three years awaiting trial. But, thanks to a tip from a reliable coöperator and corroboration from another source, Forcelli became convinced that the true perpetrator was someone named Tyrone Glynn.\n\nHe alerted the prosecutors, and was shocked to find them uninterested. \"We're telling the Bronx D.A.'s office this, and it's 'Too fucking bad,' \" he said. He interviewed Glynn, who was in prison for another crime, and succeeded in getting him to admit that he was the killer. He arrested him on the spot-an unorthodox move, given that prosecutors were planning to put another man on trial. As a result of Forcelli's action, prosecutors dropped the case against Little, but Forcelli was outraged at the carelessness with which the case had been handled. A simple records search showed that an eyewitness who had given crucial testimony against Little had been in prison at the time of the murder. \"You wonder how hard some people really look,\" Forcelli said.\n\nInvestigators who challenge the justice system inevitably make enemies. They are denounced by colleagues as \"rats\" or banned from D.A.'s offices or sidelined at work. Forcelli has had his fair share of such treatment, the worst of it after he spoke out about a now infamous A.T.F. initiative known as Fast and Furious. The plan was instituted in 2009, in the A.T.F. office in Phoenix, where Forcelli had started working two years earlier. It involved turning a blind eye to illegal gun sales in the hope that tracking the buyers would lead investigators to key figures in Mexican drug cartels. But the tactic carried enormous risks, as it put guns in the hands of violent criminals. After the murder of a U.S. Border Patrol agent, in 2010, was linked to guns from Fast and Furious, the program became a national scandal, leading to a congressional inquiry. Forcelli, who had often clashed with his superiors about the program's dangers, was called to testify at the inquiry, and he did not hold back in his criticism of the A.T.F. and of federal prosecutors.\n\nThe retaliation was immediate. Noreen Forcelli told me that her husband was moved from the office he'd been occupying and placed \"literally in a corner where garbage was supposed to be picked up.\" The congressional inquiry into Fast and Furious later noted the extent of Forcelli's victimization: the Department of Justice had released documents intended \"to smear his character and integrity\" and federal prosecutors made it \"practically impossible\" for him to work on their cases. Forcelli eventually filed a whistle-blower-retaliation claim against the A.T.F., which was successful. The details of the settlement are confidential. \"I didn't leave there a penny richer than I walked in,\" Forcelli said, but he achieved his aim: he could continue working for the A.T.F. He says that his rift with the organization is now healed.\n\nLegally, when defendants maintain their innocence, there are two main avenues for overturning their convictions. One is to go to prosecutors with new evidence in the hope of convincing them that the conviction should be overturned. Increasingly, prosecutors' offices have been establishing their own conviction-review units, which typically meet with defense lawyers, reinvestigate cases, and determine whether convictions should stand. There are now nearly thirty such units across the country. The Bronx D.A.'s office created one this year; this spring, it began examining Edward Garry's case.\n\nThe second avenue is a court challenge. But post-conviction claims mostly fail, because courts usually limit appeals to those arising from procedural mistakes, and make it hard to introduce new exonerating evidence. The Supreme Court has declined to establish a right to federal review of claims based purely on innocence. In its most recent major discussion of the issue, in 1993, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote that \"few rulings would be more disruptive of our federal system than to provide for federal habeas review of freestanding claims of actual innocence.\" Rehnquist's words hint at a deeper problem: the justice system has not yet learned to confront the fact that, even when there are no easily identifiable missteps, it can produce an unjust outcome. Many observers think that the best hope for remedy, therefore, is before conviction. Nancy J. King, a law professor at Vanderbilt University, told me, \"The place to focus efforts for reforms for wrongful conviction is not on the back end-it's on the front end.\"\n\nIn recent years, as more defendants have been exonerated, criminologists and legal scholars have pinpointed factors that compromise investigations and trials. As a result, evidence from jailhouse informants is now viewed with more skepticism, as is any confession obtained under duress. A more sophisticated understanding of forensic science has enabled lawyers to dispute expert testimony that was once taken as gospel, on matters ranging from ballistics and fingerprints to fire investigation. A prevalent source of error is mistaken eyewitness testimony. Forcelli recently rewrote the A.T.F.'s manual on eyewitness identifications, with the aim of improving procedures in order to safeguard against error.\n\nThese are real advances, but many shaky convictions arise from a concatenation of factors. There is no manual that Forcelli could write that would stop police departments from pressuring detectives for results or prosecutors from taking on dubious cases. The more Forcelli has looked into the matter, the more he sees a broken system, with no clear remedy. \"The sad part is that getting an innocent man out of jail is way, way, way harder than putting a guilty man in jail,\" he said.\n\nAcademic researchers have also focussed on the systemic nature of many conviction errors. Richard A. Leo, a professor of law and psychology at the University of San Francisco, told me, \"The way everyone talks about it is very legal-false confessions, police coercion, eyewitness I.D.s.\" He believes that the real issues are far broader, and include the adversarial structure of trials, confirmation bias, cultural notions about what indicates guilt, and a basic human tendency to attribute meaning to details that may be coincidental. \"It's not a narrow evidentiary problem,\" he said. \"It's a social problem. It's an institutional problem.\" Leo said that he'd once tried to calculate the number of people involved in a wrongful conviction, from police officers and prosecutors to jurors: \"It's staggering-it's, like, fifty people involved in every single one.\"\n\nWrongful convictions in the United States disproportionately affect poor people and nonwhites. African-Americans and Hispanics are the most overrepresented groups; a study of death-row exonerations found that wrongfully convicted black defendants outnumbered whites by six to one. In lower-income areas, like the Forty-seventh Precinct, demonstrable miscarriages of justice play a part in eroding trust in the justice system. The Bronx has the poorest residents of any borough and the highest percentage of nonwhite residents, and the relative unwillingness of Bronx juries to hand down guilty verdicts suggests a growing distrust of the legal system there. For as long as New York has been collecting data on jury-conviction rates, the rates in the Bronx have been significantly lower than those of the city as a whole. \"The Bronx has always had an honest and realistic skepticism against police, because their people have lived it,\" Tina Luongo, who heads the criminal practice at New York's Legal Aid Society, told me. In 2015, the other four boroughs had jury-conviction rates of at least seventy-three per cent. The Bronx's rate was forty-seven per cent.\n\nThe Garry conviction started unravelling in 2006, after federal prosecutors in Manhattan signed up a coöperator named Lawrence Broussard, who claimed that he had participated in the holdup that led to Oswald Potter's murder and that three other men had been involved. That day, he said, he and a friend, Brent Mason, had been buying drugs when they met two other men, Jose Marrero and a man he knew only as Flip. Broussard said that the four of them drove to Irene's grocery with the idea of robbing the gambling den there. Mason and Marrero waited in the car while Broussard and Flip went in. It was Flip who shot Potter, Broussard claimed. He said that Flip was a light-skinned Hispanic man. Since Broussard is black, it seemed likely that he was the dark-skinned man whom witnesses remembered. Both he and Mason also confirmed the witness testimony that one attacker had been shot; they added that it was Flip, and Broussard said that he'd been wounded in the right hand. Investigators assumed that Flip must be Garry, but there was a surprise. When police showed Mason and Broussard mug shots, neither of them identified Garry as Flip. Prosecutors passed this information to Garry's lawyer, who brought a post-conviction motion to get his client out of prison. In 2009, a Bronx judge denied the motion, saying that, though the new evidence might possibly have changed the verdict, it wasn't probable.\n\nIn 2010, Garry contacted two lawyers at the Exoneration Initiative, a Manhattan nonprofit that handles wrongful convictions. The lawyers, Rebecca Freedman and Glenn Garber, started looking into the case right away. \"It's just classic eyewitness identification without any corroboration,\" Freedman told me. \"Many of our cases are like that.\" To help Freedman and Garber in their work, Manhattan federal prosecutors put them in touch with a federal investigator named John O'Malley, who was familiar with the case.\n\nAfter an exhaustive search for records of the Garry case, Freedman came across a document that perplexed her-a request to compare the crime-scene evidence with the fingerprints of a man named Steven Martinez. The fact that someone had wanted to compare Martinez's prints with those at the grocery suggested that he had been a suspect, yet he wasn't mentioned anywhere else in the records. The request was made in 1996, the year after Garry was charged and the year before he was convicted. The officer who had requested the fingerprint comparison was Peter Forcelli.\n\nFreedman notified O'Malley, who quickly found a rap sheet for Martinez. One detail jumped out: Martinez had a scar on his right hand. O'Malley called in a colleague from the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, and showed her what he'd found. She glanced at a photograph of Martinez from the mid-nineties, and exclaimed, \"Look how close it is!\" O'Malley said, \"Holy Christ, you're right.\" In the contemporaneous mug shots of Martinez and Garry, the men looked strikingly similar. Both were light-skinned Hispanic men, about five and a half feet tall, with brown eyes, lopsided noses, and peaked ears. O'Malley then visited Broussard and showed him six numbered mug shots, with Martinez at number four. \"I open it up, and he goes, 'Oh, number four, that's Flip'-that quickly,\" O'Malley told me, snapping his fingers.\n\nThis summer, I called Martinez at a prison in Minnesota, where he is serving time for gun and drug charges, and asked him some questions. He claimed that he didn't know Broussard, Marrero, or Mason, and that the scar on his right hand was from punching someone in the mouth. He said that he was in California from early 1995 to 1997 and gave details of his life there, some of which I was able to confirm independently. However, police records show that he was questioned in the Bronx in September, 1995, a month after the Potter murder. (Asked about this later, he said that he might have confused his dates.)\n\nThe information about Martinez forms the basis of Garry's current bid for exoneration. Freedman and Garber filed a motion to vacate Garry's conviction, but Bronx prosecutors opposed it, and hearings began in the fall of 2014. \"They were fighting us tooth and nail,\" Freedman said. O'Malley, who had known Forcelli ever since they were both detectives in the Bronx, called him to tell him what was happening. Knowing that Forcelli, having filed the Martinez fingerprint request, would likely be asked to testify, O'Malley didn't discuss the new evidence, saying only that defense lawyers were questioning the Garry conviction and that he thought they could be right. Forcelli hadn't thought about the case in years, and after the call he paced around his office. \"I was trying to think about what we did,\" he said. \"I couldn't figure out where we got the wrong guy.\" At home that night, he allowed himself a two-ounce shot of tequila before dinner, and said nothing to his wife about what was going on.\n\nAs Forcelli sat in the witness box in the Bronx two years ago, and looked at Edward Garry for the first time in two decades, he still didn't know what had gone wrong. Garber handed him some photographs, including one of Martinez, and asked, \"Does anybody look familiar?\" Forcelli immediately saw the resemblance between Martinez and Garry, and had an awful realization: this was a case of mistaken identity. \"I always wondered-and it sounds weird-how did it feel to these guys who arrest the wrong guy?\" Forcelli told me. \"It feels terrible.\"\n\nThe rest of Forcelli's testimony revealed the evidence that could have prevented Garry's conviction. In 1996, Forcelli was investigating a murder in Co-op City. Martinez was a suspect, and an informant said that he'd also bragged about a robbery and a shooting at a grocery store in the area around Irene's. (Martinez denies this.) Forcelli checked a police database to see how many crimes matched this description: the holdup at Irene's was the only one. He put in the request to have Martinez's fingerprints checked against those found at Irene's. They didn't match, but it wasn't surprising: none of the crime-scene evidence could be linked with any suspects. Thinking that Martinez might have been one of Garry's accomplices, Forcelli alerted his superiors to the lead, and also informed the prosecutor on the Potter trial, but there is no evidence that anyone followed up or notified Garry's defense lawyer.\n\nAs he testified, Forcelli was aware of Garry looking at him intently. He told me that he felt a duty to look back-to somehow signal that \"I'm not his enemy, I'm not his adversary.\" He went on, \"I had a hard time looking at the family members in the gallery. They must hate my guts.\"\n\nForcelli reassured himself that at least Garry would be released soon, but he was wrong. The hearings that began in 2014 dragged on for thirteen months, and at the end of that time the judge fell ill, and Freedman and Garber had to ask for new hearings. A different judge, the Bronx Supreme Court justice Michael Gross, began hearing testimony in November of last year. When Forcelli returned to give his testimony for a second time, he recalled, \"I was irate, like, How is this guy still in jail? This isn't really very gray.\"\n\nJust before the northbound Metro-North train pulls into Ossining, riders see grass and trees give way to the guard towers and barbed wire of Sing Sing prison. The train passes quickly, but inside the prison the sense of immobility is overwhelming. Noises are constant: the flush of toilets, the jangle of keys, the shouts of prisoners, the click of locks, spurts of walkie-talkie static.\n\nWhen I visited, in April, a guard ushered me into a room painted an institutional shade of peach. \"Garry!\" she called out. Garry walked in, looking neat in a pressed green shirt and pants. Nevertheless, the guard admonished him: \"Hello. Hello. Garry, tuck your shirt in.\" Garry looked just like his old mug shot-thin, with an angular jawline and close-cut facial hair.\n\nWe started talking, and he told me that when he was a kid he rode BMX bikes on trails in Pelham Bay Park, like his friends did; by sixteen, he dealt drugs, like his friends did. \"It was there, all around us,\" he said. \"All of us got involved-when you raised around it, it seems normal.\" He'd never mistrusted the police or the courts, though. Neighborhood acquaintances who got locked up, he said, \"did what they did.\" Even when he was arrested for the Potter murder, he said, \"I thought at that time that the court system was fair. I always thought, I'll go to trial and I'll go home. It didn't work out like that.\"\n\nAs bad as the past twenty years have been, he said, recent months have been even worse. \"It's depression, it's anxiety, it's misery, it's everything in one,\" he said, looking out of a barred window toward a steep hill. \"I think I need a new word to describe the last twelve months.\" The one bright spot had been Forcelli's testimony. He had no idea what Forcelli would say, and was startled that the man who had helped put him away now seemed so intent on getting him out. \"You don't expect that,\" he said. \"He's a real cop.\"\n\nGarry gives the impression of a man who has been inside-literally and figuratively-for far too long. Now forty-one, he was twenty when he last spent a day outside. When he entered prison, he was angry but energetic, doing calisthenics in the yard; once, he wrote a searing letter to his father, reproaching him for his cocaine habit, after which his father quit drugs. But when I met him he avoided eye contact, crossed his arms, and stared at the table between us. He said that he'd stopped leaving his cell much, preferring to eat canned food from the commissary instead of going to the dining hall. At a previous prison, he told me, he'd once noticed a stray cat in the hallway. He bought cans of \"jack-mack\"-prison slang for canned fish-and put them out for the cat. In the course of a few months, he moved the cans closer to his cell until the cat came in and joined him, napping on his TV and soaking up its warmth. \"It just felt like a sense of something being normal,\" he said. He fed the cat for a year and a half, but never gave it a name.\n\nI asked him if friends from his previous life ever visited. \"I been in prison twenty-one years,\" he said. \"Everyone forgets.\"\n\nBy now, there are three men who have pleaded guilty to involvement in the Potter murder, all of whom have said that Garry had nothing to do with it. There is an alternate suspect, a man with a long criminal history who closely resembles Garry, and last month a second informant interview emerged implicating him. (According to the informant, one day in the summer of 1995 Martinez said, \"I just shot some guy on Laconia Avenue.\" Martinez denies this.) Even federal prosecutors are supporting Garry's bid for exoneration. Still, Bronx prosecutors are fighting the case and, though it will most likely be resolved this year, hearings keep falling behind schedule. Meanwhile, Garry remains in prison and his fate is uncertain.\n\nResolution could come in a variety of ways. The Conviction Integrity Unit of the Bronx D.A.'s office, which has been investigating the case since May, could at any point move to vacate the conviction. If the decision falls to Justice Gross, he will have three options. He could vacate the conviction but grant a retrial. (It would be up to the prosecution to pursue it or not.) He could vacate the conviction and dismiss the indictment, exonerating Garry. (A recent New York State ruling held that innocence, rather than merely procedural error, is enough for dismissal.) Or he could deny the motion.\n\nAfter an inconclusive hearing in May, I went to a nearby diner with Edward Garry, Sr., Garry's father. Fleshy where his son is lean, he wore a black D.C. 9 painters'-union T-shirt and a brace on his right knee; he tore the meniscus on a job site. He ordered a cup of coffee and poured a long arc of sugar into it, followed by several creamers, but barely took a sip. \"I can't eat nothing, not the way I feel,\" he said.\n\nThe night of his son's conviction, Garry, Sr., a lifelong Catholic, sat in his living room and used a lighter to set his Bible on fire. Ever since then, he hasn't celebrated Christmas or his birthday. This year, he began driving around the Bronx with Martinez's mug shot in his glove compartment, hoping to find someone who can confirm that Martinez's nickname was Flip. Anytime he receives a jury-duty summons, he ignores it, and makes a paper airplane out of it instead, because he doesn't think he could convict anyone. Not long ago, he bought a house in Florida, and he hopes to give it to his son, his only child, someday. But even that thought doesn't cheer him. \"You spend twenty-one years in a cage, being told what to do and what not to do,\" he said, and trailed off. \"The system, once they grab you and they put their hands around you- Do you know how hard it is to beat our system?\"\n\nForcelli is following the case from Miami, thinking about the fact that, although he spent most of his career trying to uncover injustice, he also ended up causing it. Sometimes he wonders if he should try talking to Garry. \"I don't know what else I would say, but I would like him to know that I'm sorry,\" he said. \"I deprived him of the years of my life that were my best years, the years I got married, the years I had children. I deprived him of those not because we made up any evidence, or we buried evidence, or we tried to push a witness, but because I was part of the process that led to that.\" ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The Assumptions Doctors Make\n\nI'd just started seeing patients, as an intern at Ben Taub Hospital, in Houston, when the senior resident on my team received notice from the emergency room that a woman needed to be hospitalized overnight, to receive treatment. He wasn't the type to argue with other doctors over the phone. Still, it was clear by his questions-\"So no fever? And she's totally hemodynamically stable?\"-that he wasn't impressed by what the doctor in the E.R. was telling him. After hanging up, the resident grabbed a colored marker and wrote a name on the whiteboard in our team room, followed by the letters \"U.T.I.\" He capped the marker with a frustrated look: patients aren't usually hospitalized for urinary-tract infections.\n\nI hurried down to meet my new patient, armed with \"Pocket Medicine\"-my Bible, a book summarizing all of internal medicine in microscript. Downstairs, the hospital's E.R. was in full, frenetic swing-the nurses drawing blood, the techs gathering vital signs, the doctors migrating from stretcher to stretcher in small teams. I followed the numbers posted above each stretcher until I found the one that I was looking for. A young and fit Hispanic man in his thirties sat at its foot, his jeans and T-shirt looking stretched and worn. A woman lay in the bed-my patient. I introduced myself, explaining who I was, before sliding past him to collect her history.\n\nI asked the woman a few questions and got little response. In the way she moved her eyes, I could see why the E.R. doctor had referred her to us. She was in her forties, broad-shouldered and tall, with bushy black hair and wide pupils that drifted from me to a nearby noise or a passing nurse, then back. I wondered if I had the wrong language, so I tried Spanish.\n\n\" Ella sólo habla inglés ,\" the man said. She only speaks English.\n\nNow it was his turn to field my questions. Instead of short, inattentive nods, I got descriptions, in Spanish, about how frequently the woman was urinating. It was happening so often that she had to wear diapers.\n\n\"Since when?\" I asked, looking at her. Once more, her eyes drifted away and then quickly returned before drifting again.\n\nI turned toward the man. \"Is everything O.K. with her?\" I said.\n\nHis look-not toward me, but directed at her-said it all. \"This is how she is now,\" he said. When they'd married, a few years earlier, she'd been different. They'd lived the routine life of couples: working, eating together, going out occasionally. But, since the mental deterioration started, it had been relentless. The woman was now someone he barely recognized. She looked much older than him, but in fact they were similarly aged.\n\nI asked him more questions, and soon enough I'd built a hypothesis in my mind: this woman had early Alzheimer's-or Lewy body dementia, or Wilson's disease, in which the copper we eat isn't properly processed, leading to buildup in the brain. I flipped to the neuro chapter in \"Pocket Medicine.\" I decided that I'd organize my patient history, which I'd soon present to my senior resident, around these neurological conditions, rather than the urinary-tract infection.\n\nOn the way back upstairs, I happened to run into Robert Graham, one of the most well-known internal-medicine professors at the hospital. Some people called Graham the Cowboy Doctor: on his weeks off, he lived on a ranch, hunting animals and farming tomatoes. He'd once shot and killed a man who had broken into his home, and often shared stories about his boxing days, as a white kid who was often taken in by a Mexican family in Houston's rough Third Ward.\n\nGraham presided over our daily Morning Report, at which we reviewed interesting medical cases. If he found a case interesting, he jotted notes on his Styrofoam coffee cup. More often-if a vital sign or a finding from a physical exam sounded incorrect to him-he grilled the presenter. If someone cited a journal article, he pried into how the study had been conducted-\"They enrolled only five patients?\"-and whether we could derive any real meaning from it. Doctors, he believed, must admit when they're wrong-an insight we'd discussed after he read \"The Confessions of St. Augustine.\" He argued openly and vigorously with other professors, but always with the same calm, measured demeanor. I imagined that he shot his rifle this way, too.\n\nI told Graham the story I'd just gathered from my new patient and her husband. \"Something seems wrong,\" I said. I kept on repeating the part that stood out to me most: \"She's still young.\" I mentioned the diapers, how her eyes couldn't keep still. I said that this was the first time anybody had mentioned her cognitive problems-which grabbed Graham's interest.\n\n\"Let's go,\" he said, motioning quickly toward the computer. He logged into the system with two index fingers. I gave him the patient's name and medical-record number and he began scrolling through the data.\n\n\"What's she in for?\" Graham asked.\n\n\"U.T.I.,\" I said.\n\nHe examined the woman's latest head CT scan. Then he released the mouse and sank back in his chair. \"Well, I definitely don't think she has early-onset Alzheimer's, or any of that other stuff you mentioned,\" he said.\n\nI began to defend my reasoning, though not too aggressively. \"But she's so young,\" I said. \"She can hardly talk. She can't control her urine.\"\n\nGraham's blue eyes lasered in on me. \"This woman has untreated diabetes,\" he said. \"It's caused her to have thousands of small strokes that have killed all these parts of her brain. That's what's causing her dementia.\"\n\n\"I didn't know it could do that,\" I said-a response that revealed my ignorance. I'd never even looked up the symptoms of untreated diabetes; I had assumed that a patient would never grow this sick from a common and manageable disease. \"Pocket Medicine,\" in its section on \"Change in Mental Status,\" described only problems such as vitamin deficiencies or opiate intoxication-afflictions that its writers presumably believed were a danger to typical patients. There was no listing for \"untreated diabetes.\" The book didn't mention poverty, or a lack of health insurance-conditions that were common among patients at Ben Taub-as a cause of any illnesses. I was starting to realize that its perfect world, in which medicine straightforwardly confronted disease, was a fiction.\n\nAs I spent more time in the hospital, a belief began to take shape in my mind: whether someone had insurance could affect their health as much as, or possibly more than, their genetics. I wasn't the only one wrestling with this idea. In 2017, Annals of Internal Medicine published a review of eleven studies that examined whether people are more likely to die if they lack health insurance. Two of these studies found that Medicaid expansion reduced adult mortality by as much as six per cent. Another paper described a randomized, controlled study of a group of people in Oregon who were given Medicaid through a lottery. Researchers looked at how the winners fared compared with people who remained on the Medicaid wait list. People who received coverage were far more likely to have their diabetes diagnosed and managed.\n\nDiabetes is an expensive illness. Even for people with health insurance, the cost of needles, syringes, extra medical visits, and lost wages can add up to an average of forty-eight hundred dollars a year-around a tenth of an average American salary. The uninsured pay much more for care, and often have less income. One out of every ten Americans is diabetic; in 2017, twelve per cent of all patients who visited the E.R. were diabetics; and nearly eight per cent of the work done in nursing homes involved treating the effects of the disease. My forty-something patient now needed the kind of twenty-four-hour care one gets in a nursing home-her husband acted as her nursing attendant, feeding her, bathing her, making sure she didn't fall, or burn herself on the stove. Of course, neither she nor her partner could afford it.\n\nNot long after the woman entered the hospital, she left: my supervising resident discharged her, after starting antibiotics for a U.T.I. that we didn't think existed. (The symptom of urinating on herself was probably attributable to her dementia.) The most valuable thing we did, apart from normalizing her blood sugar and giving her a prescription for insulin, was bringing in a social worker who could help her partner look for community resources to help with her care. I never learned if he was able to access that help, or if she continued her decline. I never saw the woman or her husband again.\n\nThe following year, I received a page about a patient whose blood sugar was too high for him to leave the hospital. The E.R. staff had pricked his index finger and fed the test strip into a glucometer. They'd thought the machine might be broken: a normal blood-sugar level is around a hundred, but the machine read \"> 499.\" Another test confirmed that his blood was nearly saturated with sugar. \"He can't leave like this,\" the E.R. doctor told me over the phone. And so I descended the stairs dutifully to the E.R. with a plan already brewing in my mind: I would lower my new patient's blood sugar enough to get him home.\n\nI was now a senior resident, and Graham was my supervisor. Nothing about the patient's history or physical exam changed my understanding of the case. After organizing my presentation, I called Graham so that he could sign off on my plan of attack. We met at the patient's bedside. \"Thirty-eight-year-old male, history of uncontrolled diabetes, presents with dizziness and malaise,\" I said. I made sure to take into account some of the nuances other residents might have missed-for instance, I noted at what times in the day the man took his already sizable doses of insulin-and concluded with my plan: an even larger dose of insulin. I started to explain the dose I wanted to give.\n\n\"Oh,\" Graham said, stopping me. \"I'm not sure I'd do that.\"\n\nHe turned to face the patient in the stretcher, who weighed more than four hundred pounds. Now Graham led the conversation. He asked the man some of the questions I'd already asked, like what he ate. But he also asked him when he ate, with whom, and if he ever found himself feeling extremely hungry after injecting insulin.\n\n\"I gotta eat,\" the man said of how he felt after an injection.\n\nGraham told the man that he was caught in a vicious circle. Higher doses of insulin were pushing sugar into his cells; this had the effect of making him hungry, which caused him to eat, which caused his blood sugar to go up again, which resulted in the need for more insulin, which resulted in more eating, and on and on. The man nodded.\n\nGraham asked him about his activity level, too-not only if he exercised, but also who he walked with, where he would go, if he had a bike at his house or a gym nearby.\n\n\"I need to find one,\" the man said.\n\nI had planned to keep my patient in the hospital for a few hours, or a day at most-long enough to document a normal glucometer reading. But Graham told us both that we would be keeping him in the hospital for at least three days. \"Your diabetes is curable,\" he said. \"Every hour, I want you to walk around the hospital three times.\" He turned to me. \"Cut his insulin in half!\"\n\nAn average diabetic patient on insulin might use ten, twenty, or fifty units of insulin daily. At home, the man took nearly a hundred units each day. I knew that Graham liked making maverick moves; I didn't argue with him partly because I doubted his plan would work.\n\n\"Just remind him to walk,\" I told the nurses.\n\nThe new dose controlled his blood glucose well, and so our new goal was to wean him fully off of insulin. For two days, the man walked around the hospital every hour, prodded by me, the physical therapists, the nurses, and Graham. He ate only a low-carbohydrate diet. And, for two days, I documented blood-sugar levels that never went above a hundred and ten. My assumptions had been wrong. Insulin wasn't the solution; what my patient needed was a whole new approach to his diabetes. Before he left the hospital, I told him to keep walking at home. \"I can't wait,\" he said. I never saw him in the emergency room again, and I never heard whether he kept up with this new approach to his diabetes. What I knew for sure was that a seemingly insurmountable problem had been at least temporarily solved. Graham had understood the science of diabetes well enough to tailor a plan for this man in particular.\n\nI was starting to think that good medicine occurred where three major forces intersected. Everything around me in the hospital-the CT scanners and glucometers, the clean hallways, the armies of clinicians-represented science, the first force, which gave medicine its precision. Whenever Graham railed against residents and students for not thinking clearly, he was emphasizing the rigors of science. But science didn't come for free. Money was also a force: doctors had to work at the intersection of science and cost. Finally, there were people. Without human beings, of course, there is no medicine. But I'd come to think of \"people\" as a principle of care-it meant connecting, trying to understand your patient as a person rather than a set of symptoms. This required communicating clearly, insuring that patients received personal attention, and doing so with respect and compassion. But it also involved a doctor's personal style. Graham's wry, skeptical, outgoing manner had helped him learn key information about the diabetic man-and this, in turn, had allowed him to evaluate his diabetes with a more precise scientific lens.\n\nI'd learned about this aspect of doctoring from my dad. Once, he'd brought me, my mother, and my girlfriend along as his guests to a gala held by the Houston Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. I was in line for hors d'œuvres when I felt a tap on the shoulder: \"Be right back,\" my dad said, already walking away. We didn't see him again for almost an hour. It turned out that one of his patients had gone into labor; he'd delivered the baby while wearing a surgical gown over his tuxedo, then returned to the party. \"She liked it,\" he said, of his outfit. Looking back, I wondered if his style as a doctor might have accomplished something, as Graham's had: could seeing the tux have relaxed the mother, helping her push harder? In medicine, there are always incalculable variables that can tip a patient one way or another. The way a doctor dresses, or conducts herself, or pronounces a word with or without respect and kindness can influence whether a patient decides to take a medication or participate in physical therapy or even undergo a procedure.\n\nScience, costs, and people-these forces all had to balance for medicine to succeed. The more I encountered patients without access to basic care, the more I realized that, in many cases, costs had become the dominant force shaping outcomes. The people part of medicine had taken a back seat; even science was playing defense, since widely available treatments weren't being delivered to those who needed them. Ben Taub, where I worked, was Houston's safety-net hospital. It ran on public funding and was meant to serve people without resources. This insulated me somewhat from the larger realities. A for-profit or nonprofit hospital would almost certainly not have allowed a doctor to keep a diabetic man on the ward for two extra days, just to test an unlikely theory about his blood sugar. It probably would've discharged him as quickly as possible.\n\nAs I thought more about cost, I started attending more to the rationing of health care. I'd encountered the word \"rationing\" in articles and op-eds, and I knew that the idea of rationed care stirred intense emotions-it was scary to think that, if medicine or equipment wasn't available to you when you needed it, you might die. After the pandemic began, a number of doctors wrote articles about the moral distress of deciding to save one person over another. But, even in normal times, rationing goes on, as an intrinsic feature of supply and demand. It's a necessary evil-the question is how we want it done.\n\nI was surprised to learn how rationing worked at a publicly funded hospital like Ben Taub. Unlike doctors at some nonprofit and for-profit hospitals, I didn't have the authority to order any antibiotic I liked; orders for more expensive antibiotics required the approval of the infectious-disease doctor, who was charged with \"antibiotic stewardship\"-making sure that nonstandard drugs weren't prescribed unnecessarily or used in ways that could lead to drug-resistant infections. I found that many therapies and tests were \"stewarded\" this way at Ben Taub, with medical and financial experts weighing in on their value. (These experts weren't in some faraway corporate office but in the hospital, and the medical stewards often dealt with patients themselves.)\n\nWaiting was another form of rationing. Elective procedures were rationed through waiting lists, some of which could be lengthy-especially if so-called temporizing measures, which might alleviate a patient's symptoms without providing a cure, were available. Diagnostic tests, such as MRIs, were rationed, too, with queues forming to use the machines and emergencies and trauma cases prioritized. It was rare for a necessary procedure or test to be totally unavailable within the safety-net system of which Ben Taub was a part; patients received chemotherapies and cancer care, for instance. But I learned that no transplants were performed. Their high costs would have made it too difficult to pay for all the other therapies. A cruder way to put this is that transplants don't offer great value.\n\nThis wasn't what I wanted to think when my new patient, who was just thirty-six, showed signs of liver failure. Utilitarianism sounds good until you meet a person left behind by the formula; that's how it was with my patient and his mother. We stood around his bedside, listening to a medical student present the case. Afterward, I turned to the man's mother. \" Cómo lo ve ?\" I asked. How does he look to you?\n\nShe had long straight hair, gray with streaks of black. She had been preening her son, smoothing out his bedsheets. Now she stopped.\n\n\"God will protect him,\" she said, forcing a smile.\n\nWe shook hands, and I nodded toward the man and he nodded back. In the hallway outside, the medical student and I spoke more pointedly. \"He's not a drinker?\" I asked. I was grasping for hope: if binge drinking had damaged his liver, then maybe, with sobriety and patience, it would improve.\n\n\"He says he doesn't drink,\" the student said. \"His mother says he doesn't, and the notes say it, too.\"\n\n\"He looks bad,\" I said. \"The liver enzymes keep going up.\"\n\nThe medical student confirmed this with a quick glance at his notes. \"Correct.\"\n\nBy a quick mental hopscotch, I concluded that our patient was going to die within the next thirty days. He needed a liver transplant, but he was poor and uninsured. The initial out-of-pocket cost of a liver transplant typically runs upward of half a million dollars; outside of a small number of charitable procedures conducted each year, it's impossible to receive one in the United States unless you are either insured or wealthy. No insurance, no liver transplant, no life. We had reached the limits of the safety net.\n\nResigned, I checked to make sure my facts were straight. \"I assume he's got no coverage?\" I said.\n\n\"Correct,\" the medical student said. \"He used to have Medicaid.\"\n\n\"What?\" I asked.\n\n\"He had Medicaid briefly, then it was taken away,\" the student said.\n\nWe reëntered the room. \" Señora ,\" I said.\"Did he have Medicaid?\"\n\n\" Antes ,\" she said, Before. She sat down next to her son. \"They took it away.\"\n\nThat afternoon, the student and I sat down with a social worker. If Texas Medicaid had taken away our patient's coverage because he earned too much, could it reëxamine his case now that his wages had decreased in the throes of illness? If he had been covered by Medicaid before, could he receive coverage again?\n\nWe waited on edge for three days as she investigated. Then, in the hallway, she gave us the bad news. He couldn't be reëvaluated. Life was slipping through his fingers on account of a few extra dollars on a disability check. My assumption now was that we would preside over our patient's death.\n\n\"Sometimes we write to congressmen about these cases,\" the social worker added.\n\nIt was a suggestion that I hadn't imagined. Maybe people could count for more than costs, after all. We started writing, believing that a cure was possible. ♦\n\nThis is drawn from \" The People's Hospital: Hope and Peril in American Medicine . \"\n\nThe dire wolf is back .\n\nWhy is the American diet so deadly ?\n\nCan we stop runaway A.I. ?\n\nWhen a virus is the cure .\n\nHow do you know when a system has failed ?\n\nA heat shield for the most important ice on Earth .\n\nThe climate solutions we can't live without .\n\nSupport The New Yorker's award-winning journalism.

      "text": "The Unasked Question\n\nIn an era of trials as a form of public entertainment, the Amadou Diallo case, in which four New York City police officers were charged with murdering an unarmed West African immigrant in the vestibule of a Bronx apartment building, was almost perfect-brief, eventful, and full of dramatic star turns. But, at a time when trials are often freighted with great political significance, the case, which resulted in acquittal for all the defendants, served mainly to demonstrate the limits of the criminal-justice system. The failure was most glaring on the subject of race, which was the ever-present subtext of everything about the case-\"the elephant in the middle of the courtroom that no one wants to talk about,\" as one participant in the proceedings put it.\n\nThe killing, on February 4, 1999, quickly took its place as a major symbolic event in the history of the city; primarily as a sombre counterpoint to the sharp drop in crime that has occurred during the mayoralty of Rudolph W. Giuliani. It took place during a routine \"stop-and-frisk,\" in law-enforcement argot; the cops said they thought Diallo had been reaching for a gun, and fired forty-one bullets at him at close range. The number of shots became a paradigm of police excess. But, as so often occurs in courtrooms, and rightly so, the trial dealt mainly with the gritty specifics-lighting conditions, bullet trajectories, autopsy reports-that make up the macabre choreography of a judicially scrutinized death. Still, the case did offer a few hints about the agonizing question at its core: what do white cops really see in black faces?\n\nA winter train trip from Manhattan to Albany provides one of the great anticlimaxes in American travel-a hundred and sixty miles up the magnificent, ice-clogged Hudson River to a dreary state capital that combines the charm of Brasília with the panache of Bayonne. This quintessentially New York City event took place here because, in December of last year, an appeals court ruled that pretrial publicity had denied the defendants a chance at a fair trial in the Bronx. From the start, the locale gave the trial a strange sense of dislocation, like a family fight in front of the neighbors. People did try to adapt, though. Early in the trial, a defense lawyer, James Culleton-whose gravity-defying swirl of gray hair gave him away as an outer-borough guy-instructed one nervous witness, \"I know you're from the city; but try to slow down.\"\n\nThe grimly efficient Judge Joseph Teresi presided, in a splendid old chamber with a cut-glass chandelier-but the trial had a second august presence as well. The Reverend Al Sharpton had a semi-official perch in the second row of benches, right behind Diallo's African-robed parents, and no one on either side could miss his comings and goings. Sharpton seemed so homesick that he'd sometimes lean back and engage in sotto-voce debates about the evidence with his longtime antagonist Steve Dunleavy, the Australian-born right-wing columnist for the Post . One sensed that Sharpton enjoyed a familiar face-any face. During one break, he smiled and growled at Dunleavy, \"After this, you and me are going on a peace walk, no matter what the verdict is.\" Sharpton seemed to be reaching a new order of eminence. One Sunday night, I ran into him on the train to Albany after he'd held a much-publicized sit-down with Al Gore earlier in the afternoon. On the night before summations, Sharpton served as the first questioner at the debate between Gore and Bill Bradley at the Apollo Theatre. He left home at five the next morning in order to make it to court on time.\n\nSharpton dominated this case from the beginning. In the first several weeks after Diallo's death, the Rev, as everyone calls him, organized daily protests outside Police Headquarters, where sometimes more than a hundred people-including such notables as Representative Charles B. Rangel, of Harlem, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, and former Mayor David N. Dinkins-were placed under arrest each day. Seven weeks after Diallo's death, as the protests continued, Robert Johnson, the Bronx district attorney, obtained an indictment charging the four officers with reckless endangerment and second-degree murder, which is punishable by a minimum of fifteen years in state prison and a maximum of life.\n\nThe charges reflected the incendiary spirit of the moment; the district attorney could not have obtained a harsher indictment. (Under New York law, first-degree murder applies only to the killing of law-enforcement officials and a few other heinous crimes.) There were two counts of second-degree murder for each defendant-one of homicide \"with intent to cause\" death and another of murder \"with a depraved indifference to human life.\" In laymen's terms, homicide \"with intent\" means murder done deliberately, and the typical example of a \"depraved indifference\" murderer is the gunman who sprays Times Square with machine-gun fire. In announcing the indictment, Johnson said, \"I recognize, as others do, that the death of Amadou Diallo has a context larger than the facts of this case.\"\n\nSharpton's protests established the context. Eighteen months before Diallo's death, a police officer named Justin Volpe had sodomized a Haitian immigrant named Abner Louima with a broken broomstick in a Brooklyn station house. (Volpe and another officer were later convicted of federal charges in connection with the incident.) But, beyond this highly publicized case, the Diallo shooting capped years of tension between white cops and black New Yorkers. \"We weren't just protesting Diallo,\" Sharpton told me recently. \"If it had been just Diallo, I would have been protesting at the Bronx courthouse. I put it on at One Police Plaza because of what goes on every day.\"\n\nCelebrated trials are usually identified with the names of their defendants, but this one was always called Diallo. The defendants in the case-Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, Kenneth Boss, and Richard Murphy-remained unprepossessingly opaque in the public mind until, and even to an extent after, they took the witness stand. Though many defendants play active roles in the courtroom, the four officers mostly sat in silence, rarely so much as whispering to their lawyers. During breaks, even as they accepted the good wishes of their families and of a rotating cast of fellow police officers, they generally kept their heads down. They embodied their defense: average, anonymous cops.\n\nIt was the prosecution's task to convince the jury that these inconspicuous men were something extraordinary: murderers. In this effort, the prosecution got off to a slow start. The lead prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney Eric Warner, sat through most of the trial with a more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger half smile on his face, and his opening statement reflected his rather mournful appearance. He spoke for a perfunctory ten minutes, and summarized the tragic banalities of the case. The four plainclothes officers were patrolling together in an unmarked car on that February night, and Carroll's attention was drawn to Diallo, who was standing in the doorway of a small apartment building on Wheeler Avenue. Carroll and McMellon approached by the outside steps. Without a word of warning, according to Warner-a point disputed by the defense-these two officers aimed their weapons at the defenseless man and emptied their sixteen-bullet clips. Then, after an inculpating \"pause,\" Boss and Murphy, trailing behind, added five and four more shots, respectively.\n\nAbout a crucial issue in the case-why would the four officers do such a thing?-Warner had nothing to offer the jury. \"We do not believe that these four defendants woke up that morning, or came on duty that night, with the intent to kill Amadou Diallo or anybody else,\" he said. Instead, he asserted, the prosecution would simply prove that \"they made the conscious decision to shoot a man standing in the confined space of a vestibule.\"\n\nThe prosecutors' initial unsteadiness came through in the classic manner of lawyers with a weak hand to play: they overstated their evidence. The government's case took only four days, and it included no eyewitnesses. There were, however, a handful of residents of Wheeler Avenue who testified about what they saw in the moments before Diallo's death. Through these witnesses, Warner sought to prove that the lighting conditions in the vestibule were good and the neighborhood safe, and that the officers therefore had little reason for worry as they approached Diallo. To establish the amount of light, the government introduced several photographs that had been taken with flashes, making it seem that Wheeler Avenue was paved with gold. (Later, the defense called Diallo's landlord, Deenauth Bassit, to show that the scene had been illuminated by, at most, two forty-watt bulbs encased in filthy globes.)\n\nWarner's picture of the Bronx as a kind of urban Mayberry also proved a hard sell. In fact, the Forty-third Precinct, where Diallo lived, ranks among the city's highest crime areas. One aspect of neighborhood life came through, largely by accident, during the testimony of Thomas Bell, a recruit at New York's police academy, who happened to live on the block and had been walking home shortly before the shooting occurred. On cross-examination, the defense sought to bring out the fact that Bell had seen Diallo and crossed the street to avoid this suspicious character. On redirect, the prosecutor tried to show that Bell had another reason for crossing the street. \"I don't like to go by that corner,\" Bell explained. \"There's a lot of garbage and rats there, and I avoid it.\" Notwithstanding the government's gloss, then, the prosecutors wound up proving one of the central contentions of the defense: that these cops had been patrolling a dark, dirty, and dangerous street.\n\nThe abbreviated prosecution case largely came down to a single fact: the forty-one shots. By the prosecutor's accounting, the sheer number of bullets established the recklessness-indeed, the murderousness-of the four officers' behavior. The prosecution's final witness, Dr. Joseph Cohen, who performed the autopsy, added the chilling fillip that at least one of the shots, and perhaps three of them, had hit Diallo when he was already down. Yet even the notorious number of shots actually proved rather little in this case. Cops are taught to keep shooting until a threat is removed.\n\nIn cases like this one, the law does not require the prosecution to prove motive. But, as the government's case ended, the question that remained in the air, unanswered, was the one that Warner had refused to acknowledge in his opening statement: why would these officers shoot this man?\n\nTrials address crimes, not culture, and the difference between a political protest and a legal proceeding is a necessary one. It is one thing to say that an entire police force has grown arrogant and brutal; it is another to establish that these four officers acted unreasonably under the circumstances. General impressions-even statistical norms-have no place in a criminal case. In a criminal case, all that matters is the actions and attitudes that can be attributed to the specific defendants on trial.\n\nYet those legal rules obscured the real meaning of this case. The four defendants belonged to the then plainclothes Street Crimes Unit, which has played a major role in the Giuliani administration's assault on crime. The S.C.U.'s \"mission,\" Police Commissioner Howard Safir once testified before the City Council, is to \"effect the arrests of violent street criminals, with a particular emphasis on recovering illegal firearms.\" Or, as Officer Boss put it in his testimony during the trial, the unit's purpose was \"to prevent 911 jobs.\" Even within the N.Y.P.D., the S.C.U. was renowned for its swaggering style. Its slogan was \"We own the night.\"\n\nThe Street Crimes Unit had existed within the police department for many years, but it was expanded dramatically during the Giuliani years. First under Police Commissioner William Bratton and then under Safir, the N.Y.P.D. adopted the fashionable \"broken windows\" theory of policing-that by cracking down on relatively minor offenses, like turnstile-jumping, the city sends the message that law-breaking of any kind will not be tolerated. \"Broken windows\" requires police officers to take aggressive steps against actual, and potential, criminals, and no cops were more aggressive than the cops in the S.C.U. Safir, in particular, admired the S.C.U.'s style, and he more than doubled its size in 1997, from a hundred and thirty-eight officers to nearly four hundred.\n\nThe growth of the S.C.U. was a matter of controversy within the N.Y.P.D., and some senior officers felt that standards and training slipped as the number of these plainclothes officers grew. (All four of the Diallo defendants joined the unit during its Safir-era expansion, and the four had never worked together until the night of Diallo's death.) The S.C.U.'s statistics hinted at the reason for the concern. As befit the growing size of the unit, its officers stopped and frisked ever more New Yorkers: 18,023 in 1997 and 27,061 in 1998. But the unit made 4,899 arrests in 1997 and only 4,647 in 1998. In other words, more cops mostly meant more mistakes-stopping more individuals who had done nothing wrong.\n\nUntil the confrontation with Diallo, the night of his death was actually a fairly typical one for an S.C.U. team. They set out from their headquarters, on Randall's Island, at about 10 P . M . and began patrolling the Soundview section of the Bronx. Steering their unmarked car through the Bronx River Houses project, they noticed, according to Officer Carroll, a young man \"lurking\" near one of the lobbies. They \"exited the vehicle,\" checked the man out, and sent him on his way. A little later, Carroll continued, \"I observed an individual who . . . looked like a violent homicide suspect.\" This man also turned out not to be the person the officers were looking for, and, according to Carroll, \"We shook his hand, apologized for the inconvenience, and myself and my partners got back in our car.\" The officers had made two stop-and-frisks and no arrests.\n\nWhen the officers approached Diallo, they never got close enough to frisk him. One measure of confusion in the trial concerned the issue of why Diallo drew the officers' attention. Carroll, who was riding in the front passenger seat, noticed him first. Later, he testified that they thought Diallo resembled a rape suspect who had operated in the area. (This was unlikely, because, as the prosecutor pointed out during Carroll's cross-examination, Diallo scarcely resembled the suspect, the last rape had occurred almost a year earlier, and in all that time Carroll had never stopped anyone else in connection with the rapes.) Rather, it seems, there was something about Diallo in particular that attracted the officers' attention.\n\n\"He was standing on the stoop,\" Carroll testified. \"It appeared he was looking up and down the block. . . . He steps back into the vestibule, like he doesn't want to be seen.\" According to Carroll, Diallo was \"slinking\" around, and \"peering\" out at the street. In light of this suspicious behavior, Carroll announced to his partners, \"I got something on the right. We gotta check it out.\"\n\nCarroll's testimony raised one of the key larger questions of the trial: on what basis can a police officer legally stop a suspect-and how do those rules operate in the real world? In a recent book, \"No Equal Justice,\" David Cole, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center, surveyed the reasons that courts have found acceptable for stopping suspects at airports, where the standards are similar to those governing stops on the street. According to Cole, the permissible reasons included: arrived late at night; arrived early in the morning; arrived in the afternoon; travelled alone; travelled with a companion; acted too nervous; acted too calm; and so on. As Cole concluded, the standards amount to a \"scattershot hodgepodge of traits and characteristics so expansive that it potentially justifies stopping anybody and everybody.\"\n\nCarroll's vague justification for the stop-with its use of loaded but largely meaningless words like \"slinking\" and \"peering\"-thus served as a legal but all too typical pretext for a nighttime stop-and-frisk. Had events proceeded normally, Diallo would simply have been the third innocent young black or Hispanic man that the officers had stopped on this shift. The quartet's oh-for-three evening was not so different from the S.C.U.'s over-all batting average.\n\nBut the stop, of course, raised an even more provocative question: what part did Diallo's race play in the officers' decision to approach him? Under the rules of evidence, the prosecutors didn't have the right even to suggest to the jury that the officers may have had a racial motive. None of the four officers said or did anything that night-or, as far as is known, ever-that might suggest a special antipathy toward blacks. Indeed, as the men repeatedly attempted to demonstrate during the trial, they were just four average cops.\n\nBut that, in a way was the problem. A statistical examination of the N.Y.P.D.'s stop-and-frisk policies, conducted by the staff of New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer in the aftermath of Diallo's death, found that blacks were more than twice as likely to be stopped on the street for violent crimes. Even adjusting for the higher crime rates of minority neighborhoods, Spitzer's investigators found that, for each arrest made, the New York police stopped many more blacks than whites. (This investigation drew on a hundred and seventy-five thousand descriptions of these stops by the officers themselves, and accepted all their rationales as true; because at least some of the officers undoubtedly fudged their reports, the real disparity between the treatment of black suspects and that of white suspects was almost certainly greater than Spitzer's numbers suggested.)\n\nIf Officer Carroll's rationale for the stop was dubious-and it was certainly within the norm of a dubious practice-his subsequent testimony made an awful kind of sense. Carroll, testifying the day before his thirty-seventh birthday, was the oldest of the four defendants by almost a decade, and with his rimless glasses and starched white shirt he looked more like an unusually buff assistant professor than like a night-prowling street cop. (By contrast, the other three defendants looked more like high-school students whose mothers had made them put on ties for the yearbook picture.)\n\nThe key moments of Carroll's dramatic day of testimony became familiar images on local, and even national, television. He said that he and Officer McMellon approached Diallo, identified themselves as police, and quietly asked to speak with him. But Diallo failed to respond and turned away, placing one hand on the doorknob and the other in his pocket. Carroll saw what he believed was the \"slide\"-the back handle-of a small black 9-mm. handgun. He shouted \"Gun!\" to his teammates-a passerby heard this-and then fired his own weapon.\n\nThe next seconds were chaotic. As Carroll started firing, McMellon, just behind him, tripped near the top of the steps and fell back. Carroll believed McMellon had been shot; so did Boss and Murphy, who then began to fire. Carroll testified that he kept firing at Diallo because Diallo remained standing, with the black object still in his hand. Diallo stayed up for so long, Carroll testified, that he thought he must be wearing a bulletproof vest. \"I started shooting at his legs,\" Carroll explained. \"I figured that was the only way to stop him.\" He was trying, he said, to \"defend my fallen brother.\" (The period just after McMellon fell was probably the much-discussed pause in the shootings. Several witnesses rapped their knuckles on the witness stand to replicate the duration of the gunfire. By their recounting, it seemed that the pause lasted no more than a second in a shootout that took about five seconds altogether.)\n\nWhen the firing stopped, Carroll ran to where Diallo lay and found only a wallet in his hand. \"Where's the fucking gun?\" he shouted. \"Where's the fucking gun?\" The officers realized the magnitude of their errors almost immediately: Diallo was unarmed; McMellon had not been shot; and they had killed an innocent man. One of the cops frantically shouted into a police radio, \"Gimme a bus and a boss!\"-an ambulance and a supervisor. Carroll, weeping on the stand, described how he heard Diallo's breathing go still: \"I said, 'Oh, God.' I just held his hand and rubbed his face and said, 'Please don't die.' \"\n\nWhen Judge Teresi instructed the jury, of eight whites and four blacks, he provided a bewildering array of choices that required three hours to detail. The charges ranged from the two theories of second-degree murder to such lesser charges as first- and second-degree manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, and first-degree reckless endangerment. Teresi drew on the usual vocabulary of the courtroom-such words as \"wrongfully,\" \"willfully,\" and \"knowingly\"-and hoped, as all judges hope, that the jurors would be able to untangle the legalese.\n\nThe Judge never addressed the real issue that sent Sharpton's protesters into the streets: the role of race in the cops' decision to shoot Diallo. Warner, the lead prosecutor, had rallied with a rousing summation, but he never quite came out and said that the defendants shot Diallo because he was black. Sharpton supported the prosecution wholeheartedly. \"I just can't believe they fired all those shots out of fear,\" he told me. \"After they started shooting, I think they decided they were just going to do this guy.\" But, for the most part, Sharpton, basking in his newly acquired gravitas, used the platform the case afforded him to push for the kinds of reforms that might prevent an occurrence like this-and untold lesser slights-from happening again. He wants more minority police officers, better training, and a requirement that New York cops live within the city. \"Three of four of these guys live outside the five boroughs,\" he pointed out. \"They feel like they are in enemy territory, and we pay the price.\"\n\nThere was no evidence, in this case, of the kind of crude racism that has festered in, say, the Los Angeles Police Department of Mark Fuhrman. There was, instead, a brief, discomforting glimpse of how average cops make snap judgments every day. Sometimes, of course, these calls are just right, and a dangerous weapon is plucked from the street, along with its owner. Sometimes, too, when a cop's gut leads him astray, the only cost is a momentary inconvenience to the young black male who is stopped and frisked. On rare occasions, as in this case, such an error turns to tragedy.\n\nIn the final moments of the trial, John Patten, Sean Carroll's bulldog of a defense lawyer, worked himself into a mini-frenzy and told the jury, in frustration, \"This case has been whipped up with passions to divide us.\" Warner coolly objected, noting that the public reaction to the death of Amadou Diallo had not been introduced as evidence in the case and thus could not be commented upon in summation. Teresi sustained, telling the jury, \"That's not part of this case.\" In the narrow gaze of the law, the Judge was right. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Rights And Wrongs\n\n\"I don't love trials,\" Judge Shira Scheindlin said recently. \"They are not a good way to tell a story. They are not efficient. And they are often so tedious-you saw that today.\" Scheindlin was sitting at a conference table in her chambers in the Daniel Patrick Moynihan building, off Foley Square, in lower Manhattan, after a long day of presiding in Floyd v. City of New York, which is the latest legal challenge to the stop-and-frisk practices of the New York Police Department. \"What I really like to do is write opinions,\" the Judge said. \"There you get to do what you think is right, what you believe in. You're pushing the margins of the envelope, being willing to be creative.\"\n\nIt was after seven o'clock in the evening, and the courthouse was nearly empty. At sixty-six, Scheindlin is renowned for her work ethic and her demands on her staff. Her clerks work from 9 A.M. until 8 P.M. every weekday. They can get lunch at the courthouse cafeteria but must eat it in chambers. They are also expected to work six hours over the weekend. (They can choose which day.)\n\nIn her office, Scheindlin was relaxed and expansive, especially when she talked about her two children, a son who is a violist with the Metropolitan Opera orchestra and a daughter who is a political consultant and pollster in Israel. (Her husband, Dr. Stanley Friedman, is an associate dean at SUNY -Downstate Medical Center.) On the bench, though, she is unflaggingly rigorous. She listens to testimony, reads the transcript on her computer in real time, e-mails her clerks, and sips endless cups of Diet Coke. Lawyers who appear before her often describe her as opinionated and brusque. (\"I've heard enough.\" \"Move along.\" \"I've ruled, counsel.\")\n\nThe primary outlet for Scheindlin's judicial creativity has been an enduring battle she has fought with the N.Y.P.D. A federal judge since 1994, she has been hearing lawsuits against the police for more than a decade. In decision after decision, she has found that cops have lied, discriminated against people of color, and violated the rights of citizens. Now, in the midst of a mayoral race, with the Democratic candidates united in their opposition to the stop-and-frisk policies of the Bloomberg administration, the Floyd case represents Scheindlin's greatest chance yet to rewrite the rules of engagement between the city's police and its people. David Floyd, the lead plaintiff, is an African-American medical student who had been stopped and searched twice. The core allegation in the case is that the N.Y.P.D. is systematically violating the rights of its citizens with unlawful stop-and-frisks, particularly by targeting minorities. The questions before Scheindlin are profound. Crime has declined in New York in recent years, as it has in other cities around the country. But why? And at what cost to the civil liberties of its people? Has New York City conducted a long-term, racially motivated campaign to deprive thousands of its citizens of their constitutional rights? Or, as Mayor Bloomberg and others maintain, has the city created one of the great law-enforcement success stories in recent American history?\n\nThe concept behind stop-and-frisk, which is sometimes also called \"stop, question, and frisk,\" is a simple and venerable one. Police officers may arrest a suspect only if they have probable cause to believe that he committed a crime. What can they do if they suspect that someone is involved in criminal activity but lack sufficient grounds to make an arrest? The Supreme Court addressed the subject in Terry v. Ohio, in 1968. According to Chief Justice Earl Warren's opinion, a stop is permissible only when \"a police officer observes unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot.\" In other words, the level of certainty needed for an officer to make such a stop is less than probable cause; the standard is often described as \"reasonable suspicion.\" According to the Terry decision, the judgment by the officer must be made on the basis of \"specific reasonable inferences\" from the evidence, not \"inarticulate hunches.\" By and large, this remains the law today. Stop-and-frisk encounters are also known as \"Terry stops.\"\n\n\"Stop, question, and frisk has been around forever,\" William Bratton, a former police commissioner in Boston, New York, and Los Angeles, told me. \"It's a basic tool. It's the most fundamental practice in American policing. It is done every day, probably by every city force in America. If the police are not doing it, they are probably not doing their job.\" Bratton served as Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's first commissioner of the N.Y.P.D., from 1994 to 1996, and is widely credited with changing the orientation of the police from responding to crime to preventing it.\n\nThrough much of the second half of the twentieth century, crime and disorder, in forms ranging from graffiti to murder to a crack epidemic, plagued New York. The police appeared powerless to address these scourges. \"Around 1960, New York City basically stopped policing,\" Bratton told me. \"The police were no longer engaged in controlling behavior in the streets. We changed that. If people are drinking cans of beer on the corner, you stop that behavior. If somebody is urinating against a building, or if you suspect somebody is casing a building for a burglary, you stop them. Of course police should be doing that. You make the streets safe, and, besides, a lot of these people committing these minor crimes turn out to have warrants out against them for more serious things.\" The approach is known as Broken Windows, after a 1982 article in the Atlantic by James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling. Bratton's interpretation of the Broken Windows approach called for vigorous police enforcement of minor crimes like fare-beating and intrusive panhandling as a tool to preserve public order and, at the same time, to catch criminals. In addition, the N.Y.P.D. under Bratton began to make extensive use of data to identify crime-prone areas and focus resources on them-an approach sometimes called \"hot-spot policing.\" Along the way, especially in high-crime neighborhoods, cops stopped people not just in the act of committing minor crimes but also for suspicious behavior.\n\nStop-and-frisk-indeed, aggressive policing generally-presents significant challenges for judges. Months, or even years, after a confrontation between a cop and a suspect, the judge must determine if the stop was legal and thus whether the evidence gathered can be used in court or should be suppressed. \"Most judges are reluctant to grant suppression motions,\" Erin Murphy, a professor at the New York University School of Law, said. \"It's hard for judges to look a police officer in the eye and say he didn't follow the law. And of course it's only defendants who look guilty who file suppression motions. It's every judge's worst nightmare that a released defendant will show up in the newspaper the next day for committing some horrible crime. If you suppress evidence, you are making it hard or impossible to prosecute a guilty person. That's a really difficult emotional and political decision for a judge to make.\"\n\nThe matter of Antonio Fernandez presented such a dilemma for Judge Scheindlin. On May 12, 1995, police received a 911 call reporting a gang meeting in progress at a small park in the Bronx. The caller said that one member, a Hispanic man wearing a white-and-black jacket, had a gun. The officers who responded found about fifty or sixty men, all Hispanic, milling around. The police frisked one man, who had no contraband. Then they followed a group of three or four men who had been standing to the side of the main group. One of them was Fernandez, who was stopped, frisked, and found to have a small amount of marijuana. At the station house, he was frisked again, and police said that he had a fully loaded .38-calibre revolver hidden in his crotch.\n\nFernandez was charged with illegal possession of a handgun, and the case was assigned to Scheindlin, who was in her early days on the federal bench. Fernandez argued that the Terry stop was illegal, and that the gun should be suppressed as illegally obtained evidence. Scheindlin agreed, writing in an opinion that, \"based on the facts presented here, the police did not have reasonable suspicion to stop Defendant and his companions.\" In part, Scheindlin said, the stop-and-frisk was illegitimate, because the anonymous tip was too vague to lead to Fernandez, but her opinion reflected a disbelief in the officers' testimony. According to the officers, Fernandez's first frisk produced a small amount of marijuana, but the second yielded a large handgun. As Scheindlin wrote, \"It is extremely difficult to believe that the same officer could have missed a bulky .38 caliber revolver hidden in Defendant's pants.\"\n\nThe case might have passed without notice, but Antonio Fernandez was not an ordinary defendant. He was better known as King Tone, the leader of the Latin Kings, one of the most notorious drug gangs in the United States, and he was being charged as part of a huge crackdown on the group by the United States Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York. \"Scheindlin is one of the very few judges who would have had the guts to toss out a case like that one,\" a former prosecutor familiar with the case said. (Three years later, Fernandez was prosecuted for heroin and cocaine trafficking and sentenced, by a different judge, to twelve years.) Scheindlin's ruling in the Fernandez case set a template for her handling of criminal cases. As one of her former law clerks put it, \"What you have to remember about the Judge is that she thinks cops lie.\"\n\nAccording to a study prepared by the Mayor's office, Scheindlin suppresses evidence on the basis of illegal police searches far more than any of her colleagues-twice as often as the second-place judge. This may mean that Scheindlin is uniquely courageous-or that she is uniquely biased against cops. (Scheindlin has said that the study is misleading, because it reflects only her written opinions, rather than bench rulings, in which she almost invariably rejects motions to suppress.) Still, she embraces her maverick status. Many judges in the Southern District previously worked as prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's office there, but she was not among them. \"Too many judges, especially because so many of our judges come out of that office, become government judges,\" Scheindlin told me. \"I don't think I'm the favorite of the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District. Because I'm independent. I believe in the Constitution. I believe in the Bill of Rights. These issues come up, and I take them quite seriously. I'm not afraid to rule against the government.\"\n\nScheindlin grew up in Detroit. Her mother was a schoolteacher, and her father, who emigrated from the Soviet Union, ran a Jewish civic organization. \"We were a political family,\" she told me. \"My father was the official Jew for many committees in the state.\" For a time, the family lived in a house once owned by a brother of Walter Reuther, the United Auto Workers labor leader. \"The house had a bullet hole, from where someone had taken a shot at him,\" she said. \"It was a tough town.\"\n\nAt the University of Michigan, Scheindlin majored in Chinese history, then continued her studies for seven years at Columbia. She never received her doctorate. \"The language defeated me,\" she said. \"The prospect of reading original documents in Chinese was just too difficult.\" Scheindlin drifted into law school, graduating from Cornell in 1975. She spent her final year of law school at Columbia, where she took a class with Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who became a mentor. Ginsburg introduced her to the legal side of the women's-rights movement, and, while still a student, Scheindlin played a role in a case that brought equal pay to female academics at the City University of New York.\n\nFor the next two decades, Scheindlin did a little bit of everything in the law. She was in private practice, a federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, general counsel to the New York City Department of Investigation, and a magistrate (a lower-level federal judge), also in Brooklyn. In 1994, at the recommendation of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who had been encouraged by Ginsburg, President Clinton nominated Scheindlin to the federal bench in Manhattan. Her professional roots in Brooklyn, which is known as the Eastern District of New York, separated her from the start from the clubby world of the Southern District.\n\nA defining event of Scheindlin's tenure as a federal judge took place on February 4, 1999. On that day, four plainclothes officers shot and killed Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, who was in the vestibule of his apartment building, in the Soundview section of the Bronx. (The officers, who thought Diallo was reaching for a gun, were charged with manslaughter. They were acquitted by a jury in Albany, where the case had been moved because of pretrial publicity in the Bronx.) The Diallo case suggested a dark side of Giuliani-era policing. The same aggressiveness that led New York cops to arrest minor offenders could turn, in certain circumstances, into a predatory approach to non-offenders, especially racial minorities. Crime rates (for whatever reason) had fallen dramatically during the Giuliani administration, but the Diallo case raised concerns about the N.Y.P.D.'s new tactics. \"The idea behind proactive policing was to get guns off the street, which was fine as far as it went, but what it meant on the street was the cops tossed every young black man that they saw,\" Jonathan Moore, a veteran civil-rights lawyer, said. \"That's what led to Diallo.\"\n\nIn response to Diallo's death, Moore and the Center for Constitutional Rights, a legal-advocacy group, filed the first class-action lawsuit challenging the city's stop-and-frisk policies. The case, Daniels v. City of New York (Kelvin Daniels was the lead plaintiff), was randomly assigned to Judge Scheindlin, and years of legal skirmishing followed. The parties settled in 2004. The city agreed to establish a written policy governing its stop-and-frisk practices and to improve the training of officers in conducting legal Terry stops.\n\nIn retrospect, though, the most important part of the Daniels settlement may have involved record-keeping. The city agreed to create a kind of checklist, which police officers would complete each time they conducted a stop-and-frisk. During the next decade, the police filled out more than four million of these forms, which served as indispensable evidence for the Center for Constitutional Rights and others in lawsuits against the city.\n\nScheindlin has a bright and airy courtroom, one floor below her chambers, and the Floyd trial, now in its third month, has settled into a routine. In jury trials, judges avoid signalling their views, so as not to influence the jurors; but in bench trials there's less reason for judges to be reticent. By this point, Judge Scheindlin's views seem etched on the faces of the lawyers before her. Moore and his colleagues bound in and greet the Judge with confident half-smiles; the team from the city's law department already look like disaster survivors, just trying to hang on. Moore and his team linger after court, chatting with spectators; the city's lawyers, led by Brenda Cooke, scurry for the door, avoiding eye contact. (Closing statements are expected this week; Scheindlin will probably render her decision within sixty days.)\n\nThe plaintiffs' key witness was Jeffrey Fagan, a criminologist and statistician, and a professor of law at Columbia, who has spent much of the past decade scrutinizing the city's vast database of stop-and-frisk reports. The stop-and-frisk form, known as the UF-250, contains boxes for police officers to check to explain why a suspect was stopped. Some of the boxes refer to specific behavior: a suspicious bulge in clothing, or a refusal to comply with an officer's directions. More than half of the four million UF-250 forms included checks in the box labelled \"Furtive movements.\" In his report, Fagan concluded that the furtive-movement box, without more evidence, suggested an unconstitutional Terry stop-that is, one not supported by reasonable suspicion of a crime. According to an algorithm that Fagan devised, eighty-two per cent of the stops were justifiable, twelve per cent were ambiguous, and six per cent appeared to be unjustified. Projecting that ratio over a decade, Fagan concluded that the N.Y.P.D. had made more than two hundred and sixty thousand illegal stop-and-frisks.\n\nThe plaintiffs have emphasized that only six per cent of stops led to arrests, just two per cent yielded seizures of contraband, and only a tenth of one per cent led to seizures of guns. According to Moore, \"What this means is that the stops are unjustified more than ninety per cent of the time.\" Moreover, the plaintiffs used Fagan's findings to support a claim that the police engaged in racial discrimination. According to Fagan's analysis, N.Y.P.D. stop-and-frisks are significantly more frequent for black and Hispanic residents-constituting eighty-four per cent of the stops-than they are for white residents, even after adjusting for local crime rates, the racial composition of the local population, and other social and economic factors. \"Statistics is a big part of how we are proving racial discrimination by the police,\" Darius Charney, who is a co-lead counsel, with Moore, in the Floyd case, said. \"We don't need to find blatant racial animus. It doesn't have to be motivated by hatred of black or Hispanic people. We are looking at evidence of stereotypical thinking. We're looking for cops using race as a factor to make these decisions in a law-enforcement context. It's using race as a proxy for crime.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nIn public, police officials have a clear answer to these accusations. \"We have had tremendous success,\" Raymond Kelly, the police commissioner since 2002, told me. \"Crime is down, and stop-and-frisk is an important reason why.\" Civil libertarians say that other factors (such as changing inner-city demographics and the end of the crack epidemic) are involved, and dispute any clear correlation between more aggressive police behavior and the falloff in crime. What is indisputable is that since Bloomberg took office, in 2002, murders have dropped twenty-eight per cent, to four hundred and nineteen in 2012, the lowest number since the city began keeping records, in 1963. Even compared with other cities where crime has also declined, New York has experienced dramatic changes. Since 2002, major crimes across the country have declined fourteen per cent; in New York, they have declined thirty-four per cent. The contrast is even more striking between New York and other big cities. If New York had Detroit's murder rate last year, there would have been forty-five hundred murders in the city-more than ten times the actual number.\n\nLawyers for the city tried to make the argument before Scheindlin about the effectiveness of stop-and-frisk, but she shut them down before they had the chance. In order to rebut Fagan's analysis of the UF-250 forms, they sought the testimony of Dennis Smith, a professor of public policy at New York University who is an expert on police management. In particular, the city lawyers wanted Smith to testify about his view that the stop-and-frisk policy was an important factor in what they termed \"the historic crime decline achieved by New York City.\"\n\nIn a pretrial ruling, Scheindlin excluded much of Smith's proposed testimony. She said that \"permitting the parties to delve into the question of whether the stop-and-frisk program actually reduces crime would risk turning the trial into a policy debate over the wisdom of the program rather than a judicial proceeding that assesses plaintiffs' constitutional claims.\" Still, as the trial has unfolded, city lawyers have continued to argue that stop-and-frisk has been a success-to Scheindlin's mounting irritation. When Brenda Cooke, the city's lead attorney, who was cross-examining Fagan, tried to make that point, Scheindlin cut her off.\n\n\"I got to put a stop to this,\" the Judge said. \"It is not a good use of my time. For one thing, I've said repeatedly that one issue that is not present here is the effectiveness of this policy, because that's not for this court. This court is only here to judge the constitutionality. . . . We could stop giving Miranda warnings. That would probably be exciting for reducing crimes. But we don't allow that. So there are a number of things that might reduce crime, but they're unconstitutional. This court is only concerned with the Constitution, not with the effectiveness of the policy. I've tried and tried to explain that. This is my third or fourth try.\"\n\nEven then, the city's witnesses persisted in defending stop-and-frisk as a sure means to reduce crime. In a way, the entire conflict in the case came down to a single exchange between Moore and Joseph J. Esposito, who had just stepped down, after thirteen years, as the chief of department in the N.Y.P.D., the highest-ranked uniformed officer in the force. Chief Espo, as he is known, was a renowned figure in the N.Y.P.D., and his demeanor on the stand suggested that he was more accustomed to giving orders than to answering questions. Esposito poorly concealed his contempt as Moore, shambling but relentless, pursued him about the propriety of stop-and-frisk. Moore noted that the number of stop-and-frisks had increased from approximately ninety-seven thousand, in 2002, to almost six hundred and eighty-five thousand, in 2011.\n\n\"So that increase is all on your watch, correct?\" Moore asked.\n\n\"Yes, it is,\" Esposito said, plainly seething. After a slight pause, he volunteered, eyes flashing, \"As is the forty-per-cent decrease in crime during my time-as is the eighty-per-cent decrease in the last twenty years.\"\n\nIn the Southern District, plaintiffs in civil cases can designate new cases as related to old ones and thus guarantee that the same judge presides. Ever since the Daniels case, civil-rights and civil-liberties groups have continued to challenge the stop-and-frisk policies of the N.Y.P.D. Each time, the plaintiffs have made sure that the cases went before Judge Scheindlin, who currently has three such class actions on her docket. The Floyd case challenges the practice citywide; Davis v. City of New York, which will go to trial later this year, involves stops at city-owned housing projects; and Ligon v. City of New York, which is farthest along in the process, concerns searches at privately owned properties around the city.\n\nThe Ligon case was initiated by the Bronx Defenders, a nonprofit organization that represents indigent defendants in the borough. The lawsuit was based on the experience of, among others, Charles Bradley, a fifty-year-old security guard from the South Bronx who went to visit his fiancée at her apartment building, in the Parkchester neighborhood, on May 3, 2011. When he went upstairs, she didn't answer her doorbell at first-she is deaf in one ear-so Bradley went downstairs to wait. \"An officer got out of an unmarked van and came up to me,\" Bradley recalled. \"I just accommodated the officer to the best of my ability, and, in turn, what happened was, he went into my pockets. . . . There was nothing in my pockets except my house keys, my cell phone, my wallet. The thing about it that was so appalling was that I had spent my last dollar to see my loved one. And then he said, 'Fuck that, you're going in.' \" Bradley was arrested for trespassing, a misdemeanor, and strip-searched.\n\nAt the local precinct, Bradley was given a Desk Appearance Ticket, a common first step in the legal process for minor offenses in New York City. He was instructed to appear in criminal court on July 19th, but he faced a more immediate problem. \"There was a domino effect from being arrested,\" Bradley said. The arrest would be reported to a New York State licensing agency for security guards, and that might mean the loss of Bradley's job. \"I need a license to be a security guard, and I would have lost it if they pressed charges,\" he said. \"If I lose my license, I lose my income. I could have been put into homelessness for all this.\"\n\nBradley took the ticket to the offices of the Defenders, who have pioneered what they call \"holistic defense,\" a method based on recognizing that, for criminal defendants like Bradley, deportation, eviction, or the loss of parental rights may be more ruinous than conviction or jail. Bradley met with two lawyers-an employment specialist and a criminal-defense attorney. \"Charles was freaking out,\" Molly Kovel, the employment lawyer, said. \"We had seen it before. Many of our clients are security guards or cabdrivers, and both are licensed by the government. For a lot of minor crimes, the bigger threat to their lives is losing their jobs, rather than getting convicted.\" Kovel kept the licensing authorities at bay while a colleague, Cara Suvall, dealt with the criminal case. \"I had the problem of how to prove his innocence,\" Suvall said. \"So we went and got a notarized letter from his fiancée saying that he really was visiting her. I took it to the district attorney, and they agreed to drop the charges.\"\n\nStill, the experience of Bradley and others prompted the Bronx Defenders to file a class-action suit against the city. The case focussed on the N.Y.P.D.'s Operation Clean Halls program, through which private landlords give the police advance permission to patrol their property. This led to Ligon v. City of New York, in which the Defenders were joined by the New York Civil Liberties Union, the public-interest group Latino Justice, and the law firm of Shearman & Sterling. (Jaenon Ligon, the lead plaintiff in that class action, had also claimed to be the victim of an unlawful stop-and-frisk.) They charged that the police were using Operation Clean Halls to conduct unconstitutional stop-and-frisk searches of innocent citizens like Bradley.\n\nAt a hearing in October, 2012, Scheindlin listened to testimony from both Bradley and Miguel Santiago, the officer who placed the cuffs on him. Santiago testified that Bradley was in a \"drug-prone location\" in a high-crime neighborhood and was \"suspiciously walking back and forth\" outside the building. Santiago said that he approached Bradley by saying, \"Excuse me, sir, could you come over here?\" and that Bradley could not tell him his girlfriend's name or produce any identification. But Judge Scheindlin noted that Santiago's paperwork contradicted his account in several ways-he had written, for example, that he approached Bradley inside the building.\n\nIn a hundred-and-fifty-seven-page opinion, handed down on January 8th this year, Scheindlin gave the Defenders a resounding victory. \"Officer Santiago claimed that he was able to see Bradley's suspicious behavior even though he was inside a police van parked across the street, twenty or thirty feet from the door, separated from Bradley not only by the street but by the windows of the front door, a vestibule, the windows of an inner door, and the hallway,\" Judge Scheindlin observed. \"I find Bradley's account credible.\" She was especially moved by Bradley's story. \"If an unjustified stop happens to lead to an unjustified arrest for trespassing, as it did in Charles Bradley's case, not every overburdened public defender will have the wherewithal to obtain a notarized letter from the defendant's host explaining that the defendant was invited, as Bronx Defender Cara Suvall did on behalf of Bradley,\" she wrote. \"When considering the relative hardships faced by the parties, it is important to consider the potentially dire and long-lasting consequences that can follow from unconstitutional stops.\" Scheindlin concluded that a \"very large number of constitutional violations took place\" as a result of Operation Clean Halls.\n\nScheindlin had found the city liable in the Ligon case, but what was the remedy? Here the Judge sprang a surprise. She wrote that she was going to decide the city's punishment in the Ligon case (which the city had already lost) at the end of the Floyd trial (which had not even taken place). In other words, it looked as though Scheindlin were scheduling her remedies hearing as if she had already ruled against the city in Floyd. In a footnote, Scheindlin added, \"I emphasize that this ruling should in no way be taken to indicate that I have already concluded that plaintiffs will prevail in Floyd.\" But the city lawyers in the Floyd case are skeptical that the Judge's mind is open. \"It's like she has scheduled our sentencing before she's even found us guilty,\" one said.\n\nPolitically, the verdict on stop-and-frisk seems already clear. The Democratic mayoral candidates running to succeed Michael Bloomberg all criticize stop-and-frisk, differing only in the intensity of their complaints. Christine Quinn, the City Council speaker, said recently, at Barnard College, \"I want to leave it as a tool in police officers' toolboxes,\" but she noted, \"We need to put an infrastructure of reform around stop-and-frisk.\" Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, said at a mayoral forum, \"We need to send a message to every young man of color that they are beloved, they are valuable, they are our future. You can't do that if you're constantly treating people as suspects.\" John Liu, the comptroller, has gone even further. \"Stop-and-frisk doesn't have to be amended, it has to be ended,\" he said at the forum.\n\nIn response, Bloomberg took the unusual step last month of giving a speech to the leadership of the N.Y.P.D. in which he both celebrated his record in reducing crime and addressed the allegations in the Floyd case. \"As the ongoing federal court case is now demonstrating for any objective observer to see,\" the Mayor said, \"the N.Y.P.D. conducts stops based on seeing something suspicious, or witnesses' descriptions of suspects, not on any preconceived notions, or on demographic data that would have you stopping old women as often as you stop young men.\" Commissioner Kelly, for his part, is dismissive of the mayoral candidates' criticism. \"This is just pandering. This is what goes on in New York politics,\" he told me. \"They try and get as far left as they can for the primary, where it's just a tiny number of people who are voting. Then the challenge is to get to the center for the general election. That's all that's going on here.\"\n\nIn the courtroom, before Judge Scheindlin, the city is attempting to put on a defense. The lawyers are pushing back on the plaintiffs' most incendiary claim-that the stop-and-frisk policy has been applied in a racially discriminatory manner. \"It's close to a perfect correlation between who is committing crime and who is being stopped,\" Celeste Koeleveld, the deputy Corporation Counsel who is supervising the defense, said. \"That's true in minority neighborhoods, and also in predominantly white areas, like Staten Island.\" She noted that more than half of the N.Y.P.D. consists of racial minorities. Kelly goes further, asserting that stop-and-frisk protects, rather than oppresses, the African-American community. In a speech last month before Al Sharpton's National Action Network, Kelly said, \"African-Americans, who represent twenty-three per cent of the city's population, made up sixty-four per cent of the murder victims and seventy-one per cent of the shooting victims in this city last year.\" He added, \"African-American men between the ages of sixteen and thirty-seven, who are just four per cent of the city's population, comprise forty per cent of those murdered citywide; eighty-two per cent of these young men were killed with a firearm. As a city, as a society, we cannot stand idly by in the face of these facts.\" He said, \"I believe that this tactic is lifesaving,\" and, referring to Terry v. Ohio, he added, \"It is also lawful and constitutional as upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1968.\"\n\nNevertheless, it appears that public criticism-and Scheindlin's rulings-has already changed the behavior of the police. In March, just as the Floyd trial was beginning, the N.Y.P.D. revised its instructions to officers in filling out the stop-and-frisk reports, demanding that they provide narrative details on their reasons for the confrontations. More significant, perhaps, in the first quarter of this year the number of police stops dropped by fifty-one per cent.\n\nIn both the Floyd and the Ligon cases, the plaintiffs are asking for Scheindlin to appoint an independent monitor, to make sure that the police comply with the Constitution. They want the Judge to impose a sort of receivership on the police, creating a dual internal authority as a check on the existing leadership. As a model, the plaintiffs' lawyers cite a case in Cincinnati a decade ago, in which the city agreed to fund an independent monitor who filed regular reports on the local cops' compliance with the law. (Bloomberg called this notion a recipe for chaos.) The idea of the independent monitor, like the lawsuits themselves, is rooted in the hope that a single judge can diagnose a complex problem and reform a huge organization like the New York Police Department based on the imperfect medium of trial testimony. Scheindlin's dedication to protecting citizens' rights is beyond question; it is less clear that she has the wisdom, or even the ability, to impose her vision in the real world of New York.\n\nScheindlin's confidence in her understanding of the Constitution remains unshaken. Back in her chambers, after a long day of testimony from a plaintiff's expert on police procedures, Scheindlin talked about another celebrated case of hers. Shortly after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, investigators found the name and phone number of Osama Awadallah on a scrap of paper in a car rented by one of the hijackers. On September 21, 2001, F.B.I. agents in California arrested Awadallah. He was not charged with any crime but was held as a material witness. On October 10th, he testified before a grand jury in New York that he was acquainted with one of the hijackers but denied knowing another who lived in the San Diego area. He was indicted for perjury, but on April 20, 2002, before the trial had even begun, Scheindlin threw out the case against him.\n\nIn a pair of lengthy opinions, Scheindlin said that the government had violated the material-witness law, by holding Awadallah too long and under unduly harsh conditions. She quoted the famous Supreme Court case of Ex Parte Milligan, in 1866: \"The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people, equally in war and in peace, and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of men, at all times, and under all circumstances.\" The Court of Appeals reversed Scheindlin's ruling and ordered her to bring Awadallah to trial. The trial ended in a hung jury; in a second trial, he was acquitted.\n\n\"That case was just an enormously satisfying experience,\" Scheindlin told me. \"What I did was gutsy, because it was so close to 9/11. For me to suppress that evidence stunned people, because there was no question that he did know the hijackers. You saw the world changing in how each jury saw the case. The first jury was eleven-to-one to convict. But by the time of the second trial the Bush policies were unpopular, and he was acquitted. That was a vindication.\"\n\nEach day, before Scheindlin goes to court, the last thing she sees in her chambers is a framed copy of an article she co-wrote with Brian Lehman, a former law clerk, in the New York Law Journal . Headlined \" ONE DAY IN SEPTEMBER ,\" and published in September of 2006, it was, like many stories published around that time, a commemoration of an anniversary. \"It was a day in September that changed America forever,\" she wrote. But her story wasn't about September 11, 2001. It was about September 25, 1789, the day that Congress passed the Bill of Rights. Thanks to that document, the authors wrote, \"If a judge decides that a defendant's rights have been violated and the case is dismissed, a remarkable thing happens: the government bows to the rule of law.\" ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "Geoffrey Canada on Giving Voice to the Have-Nots\n\nReleased on 07/29/2013\n\nGood morning.\n\nAnd thank you all so much for coming to this event\n\nat The New Yorker Festival 2012.\n\nI'm George Packer, I am Staff Writer at The New Yorker,\n\nand it's an honor to be on stage with these people,\n\nand I don't say that lightly.\n\nSo, this was originally called Left Behind,\n\nand someone left that one behind,\n\nand changed it to Giving Voice,\n\nwhich didn't shed a whole lot more light on it.\n\nWe're gonna talk about the things that interest the people\n\non our panel this morning, and here's who they are.\n\nTo my immediate left is Geoffrey Canada.\n\nHe probably doesn't need to be introduced,\n\nbut I will anyway.\n\nHe's the president and CEO of the Harlem Children's Zone,\n\nwhich provides educational\n\nand social services to poor children and their families\n\nin an area of central Harlem that began as 24 blocks\n\nand is no 97 blocks of Harlem,\n\nand it includes two charter schools that he founded,\n\nThe Promise Academies.\n\nHe was born and raised in the south Bronx,\n\na little north of the Harlem Children's Zone,\n\neducated at Bowdoin and at the Harvard School of Education,\n\nand he's the author of two books,\n\nautobiography called Fist Stick Knife Gun:\n\nA Personal History of Violence in America,\n\nand Reaching up for Manhood,\n\ntransforming the lives of boys in America.\n\nHe's also been teaching tae kwon do for 30 years\n\nand is the founder of the Chang Moo Kwan Martial Arts School\n\nand I think he is a third degree black belt?\n\n[Geoffrey] Well, it's six degree now, but who cares.\n\n(audience laughs)\n\nI'm not messin' with you, let's just put it that way.\n\nAnd second down is Jose Antonio Vargas,\n\nwho was born in the Philippines about five years ago,\n\nhe's so much younger than the rest of us. (chuckles)\n\n(audience laughs)\n\nHe was brought to California,\n\nactually very near where I grew up, at age 12,\n\nwent to Mountain View High School,\n\nwhich was a rival of my high school.\n\nWhich high school did you go to?\n\nGunn High School.\n\nOh.\n\n(all laugh)\n\nWhat did that mean?\n\nNow I'm gonna have to worry about it.\n\nAnd to San Francisco State.\n\nHe was brought here at 12 to live with his grandparents.\n\nWhen he was 16 and went to get his driver's license,\n\nhe found out that he did not have legal papers\n\nto be in the United States.\n\nHe was one of the 11 million undocumented immigrants.\n\nHe began working for newspapers and websites,\n\nmost notably The Washington Post,\n\nwhere he wrote people with HIV in Washington\n\nand then was part of a team that won a Pulitzer\n\nfor covering the shootings at Virginia Tech.\n\nHis first piece for our magazine was published in 2010,\n\nand it was a profile of Mark Zuckerberg,\n\nwhich was a pretty great way to start out\n\nat The New Yorker.\n\nAnd last year, he wrote an essay\n\nin The New York Times Magazine,\n\nwhich should have been in The New Yorker,\n\n(audience laughs)\n\nin which he told the story of his life\n\nand of how he'd been living for about 15 years\n\nwith the secret of being undocumented and what that meant.\n\nAnd it was kind of coming out,\n\nand since then, he's founded Define American,\n\nwhich tries to change the way\n\nAmericans talk about immigration.\n\nAnd next down is Professor Abhijit Banerjee,\n\nwho's born in Kolkata, educated there and in New Delhi,\n\nand then received his PhD in economics from Harvard,\n\nand he's the Ford Foundation International Professor\n\nof Economics at MIT.\n\nHe co-founded, in 2003, the Poverty Action Lab at MIT,\n\nwhich tries to reduce poverty by ensuring\n\nthat policies are based on scientific evidence,\n\nwhich can be tested in radomized evaluations.\n\nAnd last year, he co-authored with Esther Duflo\n\nPoor Economics:\n\nA Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty,\n\nwhich became kind of an international best seller,\n\nwhich it doesn't usually happen\n\nto books on development economics\n\nand won The Financial Times Goldman Sachs\n\nBusiness Book of the Year Award.\n\nAnd finally, Kathrine Boo, who's a colleague of mine\n\nat The New Yorker, has been, actually,\n\nsince the year I arrived, 2003,\n\nwhere she's written about poverty and education\n\nand social and economic policy but always in narrative\n\nand intimately narrative form.\n\nBefore coming to The New Yorker, she wrote for The Post,\n\nlike Jose, and won a Pulitzer like Jose.\n\nShe also has won a MacArthur.\n\nHave you won a MacArthur?\n\nWhat's wrong with him? (laughs)\n\nI don't know what's wrong with that foundation,\n\nbut I haven't gotten that one. (laughs)\n\nI'd assume there are at least two on this panel.\n\nAnd this year, Kate wrote Behind the Beautiful Forevers,\n\na book about a slum in Mumbai,\n\nwhich is my choice for Nonfiction Book of the Year.\n\nSo, I wanna start with the problem of language,\n\nalmost get it out of the way,\n\nso we can then have an anxiety-free discussion\n\nabout a vex subject.\n\nI noticed in the debate the other night,\n\nthe notorious debate, that Mitt Romney at one point\n\ntalked about poor people, which hasn't happened very often\n\nin the campaign on either side,\n\nand immediately, he caught himself and said lower income,\n\nas if he had said homosexual, oh, I mean gay,\n\nor negro, I mean black, it was like he had said something\n\npolitically incorrect, and so he switched\n\nfrom poor to lower income,\n\nand I remember sort of being puzzled by that,\n\nlike what's wrong with saying poor people?\n\nSo first, for all of you, and maybe Geoff, you could begin,\n\nwhat, if anything, is wrong about the way\n\nwe talk about poor people and poverty?\n\nAnd I'm sure that the word poor people\n\nis not at the top of the list.\n\nYeah, I think a number of us here in the states\n\nhave been worried about the conversation around poverty.\n\nPoverty as I think a state of economic condition\n\nin this country has associated with it\n\nlots of, I think, images of poor black and brown folk\n\nwho probably don't have the right values and attitudes\n\nand behaviors, and the fact that poverty is now\n\na national condition that impacts whites\n\nand everybody else in this country\n\nis something the country hasn't dealt with.\n\nIn the Republican primary, you had two candidates\n\nboth say African Americans don't want food stamps,\n\nI'm gonna give them something else.\n\nWell, neither one of them understood\n\nthat there are 47 million Americans on food stamps.\n\nThey are a majority white, overwhelmingly white,\n\nin their minds, they thought this was a black issue, right,\n\nin that poverty is a national condition\n\nis something the country doesn't wanna deal with.\n\nAnd so I think that they hide that\n\nby trying to use language that doesn't have\n\nall the pejorative impact that we associate\n\nwelfare queens, sort of the makers and the takers,\n\nand all of that kind of language\n\nversus that we're in the condition in this country right now\n\nthat a huge number of Americans are poor,\n\nand we need to address that issue.\n\nBut do you think political people\n\nor people in public life are becoming more comfortable\n\nwith language that demonizes the poor?\n\nOr are they becoming more euphemistic?\n\nLook, I think that, you have not heard folk\n\nbe honest about the conditions\n\nthat lots of Americans find themselves in,\n\nthat the unemployment rates,\n\nthe reductions are really driven by people who have given up\n\nare hoping to find a job is not something\n\nthat people wanna talk about.\n\nIt's not part of the American sort of way of thinking\n\nabout these kind of problems.\n\nAnd the issue becomes that I think people think\n\nthat this is a minor issue in the American\n\nsort of landscape, and I think it's a major issue,\n\nso it's almost decided, just don't mention the word,\n\nright, because if you mention the word,\n\nit's just gonna make people uncomfortable,\n\nand so we'll just pretend that this is not, right now,\n\na fairly national disaster happening in America.\n\nJose, you told me\n\nyou had avoided the subject of immigration as a journalist\n\nYeah, like the plague. for an obvious reason\n\nuntil you wrote that essay, and since then,\n\nthat's become your subject, both as a journalist\n\nand as an activist, so what is it about the way\n\nAmericans talk about immigrants that perhaps gets in the way\n\nof clear thinking about the subject.\n\nOh, that's such a great question.\n\nI think we have a really big framing problem.\n\nI mean, the fact that you even, you know,\n\nI don't know if people know this,\n\nbut two weeks ago, I kind of issued a very public challenge\n\nto the media, particularly The New York Times\n\nand The Associate Press to stop using the word illegal\n\nto refer to people, just because it's really inaccurate\n\nan imprecise and really dehumanizing.\n\nI mean, can you think of any other instance\n\nin which we refer to people as illegal, right?\n\nAnd to me the fact that most people do that,\n\nincluding The New York Times, is in some ways,\n\nit underscores the very simplistic nature\n\nin which we understand the issue.\n\nI mean, let's think of it this way.\n\nIn some ways, the word illegal\n\nstarts and ends the conversation.\n\nHow do you legalize people who are illegal?\n\nThat's it.\n\nLike, I've been traveling around the country\n\nin places like Alabama and Arizona,\n\nin places where I really shouldn't be going, and\n\n(audience laughs)\n\nbut it was fascinating\n\ntalking and really interviewing people,\n\nlike I did a lot of like Jay Leno man in the street style\n\nkind of stuff, and having people just interchangeably say,\n\nyou know, the Mexicans, you know, those illegals,\n\njust kind of in one breath.\n\nAnd of course, you have to stop them and say that\n\noh, by the way, not all undocumented people are Mexicans,\n\nFYI, I'm Filipino.\n\n(Geoff chuckles)\n\nYou know, that kind of stuff, right?\n\nAnd the fact that we have this very brown,\n\nit's almost as if we've created\n\nthis border ghetto Mexican thing in our minds,\n\nthat in some ways really, look,\n\none interesting statistic.\n\nOut of the 11 million undocumented people in America,\n\none million are fully Asian and Pacific Islander.\n\nOut of the 11 million, do you ever hear about that?\n\nNo.\n\nI was stunned when one of the things\n\nthat people always asked me is, you know,\n\nwhy don't you just make yourself legal?\n\nThat's like the biggest, that and,\n\ntwo is like what about illegal don't you understand?\n\nAnd why don't you just make yourself legal,\n\nwhich of course, I usually answer because I'm a masochist,\n\nand this is so much more fun.\n\n(Geoff laughs)\n\nAnd if you look at, take that back now\n\nto how we talk about it, right,\n\nwe talk about illegal immigration\n\nin a purely problem-centric framing\n\nand never a solution-centric framing.\n\nIt's always about the problem, never about the solution.\n\nAnd unless we change that, unless we realize\n\nthat there is no process for people like me\n\nto legalize myself,\n\nuntil we actually look at people as human beings, right,\n\nI don't think we're going to be able to unpack\n\nwhat this really is.\n\nThat's why language is at the heart of that.\n\nThat's why using the word illegal in some ways\n\nis really counterproductive and incorrect.\n\nAbhijit, two-part question along these lines.\n\nOne, do you find that in India or in Southeast Asia,\n\nor other places you have studied and written about,\n\nthere's the same aversion to talking about poor people,\n\nto talking about them at all\n\nto calling them by a simple term?\n\nAnd second, among scholars, is there a language\n\nor a way of talking about this subject, your subject,\n\nthat also gets in the way of understanding\n\nand of clear thinking about it?\n\nSo, in the popular discourse in India,\n\nI think what's interesting\n\nis in some ways, it's not so much that people,\n\nI wouldn't say they have an aversion\n\nto talking about poor people.\n\nPoor people are, but on the other hand,\n\nif you read through a newspaper on a given day,\n\nthere will be no,\n\nthere will be very likely there'll be no stories\n\nabout poor people, so poor people are not interesting news.\n\nThey are sort of, they're there,\n\nI don't think there's a sense of denial that exists\n\nin this country, it's quite the reverse.\n\nThey're kind of the furniture,\n\nbut that also populates the entire policy space, then,\n\nbecause you think of them as being more or less\n\nmoveable objects, and policy is thinking about\n\nI'm going to hang them this or move them here,\n\nor do this to them.\n\nAnd it's that sense of being like a moveable object,\n\nwhich I think characterizes a lot of\n\nhow the poor are talked about less, less I think,\n\nthis sense of fright or threat,\n\nwhich it think is much more the U.S. perception\n\nor even a bit the European perception\n\nof the suburbia of Paris, of the sense of\n\nthe dangerous people live out there.\n\nAt least, now, there's lots of variation.\n\nBrazil and South Africa are much more like the U.S.\n\nthan India or Kenya.\n\n[George] You mean the poor are more out of sight.\n\nAnd more of a threat.\n\nI think there is a range there,\n\nbut there's at least, in India,\n\nthey're not seen as a threat,\n\nthey're seen as some things that we're going to deal with.\n\nBut so much of your research is about breaking down\n\neasy generalizations and looking at particular cases\n\nand finding scientific evidence for why, for example,\n\nthis population might not be using mosquito nets\n\nthat have been given to them.\n\nSo do you, yourself, sort of find yourself\n\ntrying to avoid encompassing terms like the poor\n\nbecause it might hide the evidence that you find\n\nin your research?\n\nActually, we embrace the term the poor\n\nbecause we found it less dishonest than all the other terms.\n\n(panelists chuckle)\n\nSo there's a sense of,\n\nyou have to somehow deal with the fact\n\nthere's something common about these people,\n\nand what we were interested in\n\nwas precisely the universality of that,\n\nso we were very much embracing the term.\n\nI think other terms, they exist like the marginalized,\n\nbut, you know, marginalized by whom?\n\nIt's not that 85% of the population been marginalized,\n\nthey're sort of there.\n\n(all laugh)\n\nIt's a big margin.\n\nAnd Kate, your book and your journalism\n\nalso has an aversion, I'd say, to generalization.\n\nYou find the particulars,\n\nand there's an implied truth behind it,\n\nbut I don't read you, and certainly not\n\nin Behind the Beautiful Forevers,\n\ntalking generally about poverty and policy about poverty.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nWell, I mean, one of the things that animates my work\n\nis that I feel that these issues of poverty and development\n\nand the effects of inequality\n\nare some of the most over-theorized and under-reported\n\nissues of our time, and part of the problem\n\nis that it's difficult to to into communities\n\nand spend a great deal of time with people\n\nand understand their lives.\n\nIt's much, much easier to interview a public official\n\nand go into a drive by in a housing project or a slum\n\nand come away and say that's how people feel.\n\nBut one of the things that really frustrates me\n\nabout the way that we talk about poverty\n\nis that we have this whole language,\n\nand it's people are stuck in poverty\n\nand people in mired in poverty.\n\nIt's this still, static language,\n\nbut the truth is, whether it's in the United States\n\nor in India, you've got capital winging around the planet.\n\nThe experience of poverty is extremely volatile,\n\nand this great kid named Norberto,\n\nwho I spent time with in Denver several years ago\n\nsaid this thing to me, he said,\n\nI don't get this phrase, my family can't get ahead\n\nbecause my family gets ahead all the time.\n\nAnd then somebody gets sick or the car breaks\n\nand we slip back down.\n\nIt's the same, everywhere I go.\n\nAnd to not acknowledge how volatile that is\n\nis really to underestimate the stress\n\nthat that places on families and communities.\n\nAnd societies as a whole.\n\nAbhijit, since you began to do this work\n\nwith The Poverty Action Lab,\n\nwhat among the assumptions you might have brought to it\n\nor the assumptions we all bring to it,\n\nhas been completely shattered?\n\nWhat is the Have a talk with people.\n\nMy top five?\n\n(Katherine chuckles)\n\nSure, take five.\n\nI think I started as someone who had two lives.\n\nI grew up next to a slum in India,\n\nand I was trained in mainstream economics.\n\nAnd those things were essentially\n\nto entirely parallel universes in my head,\n\nand so one day, I started to realize\n\nthat I actually need to make sense of both,\n\nand once you start doing that,\n\na lot of what happens is that\n\nthe presumptions of mainstream economics have to give way,\n\nand a lot of way.\n\nSo if I were to pick one, I would say,\n\nI think we have very little understanding\n\nof the psychological state of poor people,\n\nthat is to say what it means to be,\n\nI think Kate said it exactly right,\n\nthis idea of the stress of being poor.\n\nAnd what the consequences of being permanently under stress\n\nand permanently trying to think\n\nif I, yes, I have to remember to get the water,\n\nthere's only 45 minutes between when the water comes\n\nand fill up six buckets, run back,\n\nand then I have to make sure that my daughter\n\ngoes off to school because her school starts early\n\nand then get back and quickly get firewood\n\nso that I can, because people go picking firewood,\n\nI will run out, and then I have to come back,\n\nand then I have to start the fire,\n\nand by that time, my mother-in-law, who is sick,\n\nis going to need her medicine.\n\nAnd just this amount of, just the number of balls\n\nyou have to keep in the air,\n\nand I think once you take that into account\n\na lot of the why the poor behave\n\nin potentially different ways from other people\n\nmake a lot more sense, just the degree of.\n\nWhat do you mean by different ways?\n\nSo, for example, and example that we often give\n\nis of a man met in Morocco.\n\nAnd he was explaining, we went to his house,\n\nwe were standing outside,\n\nand what would you want to do\n\nif you had a little bit more money,\n\nand he said, oh, I want to buy some food.\n\nAnd then we said, ah.\n\nAnd if you had even more money,\n\nhe said, oh, I want to buy the food.\n\nAnd so we sort of thought that this guy is really hungry.\n\nThen, we go into his house,\n\nand there is a television, a parabolic antenna,\n\na DVD player in there.\n\nSo my first reaction,\n\nand this is sort of your economics training.\n\nWhy haven't you bought the food then?\n\n(audience chuckles)\n\nWhen, in fact, he was very clear.\n\nHe said television is much more important than food.\n\nAnd I think the thing about that which we forget\n\nis poor people have to live their lives.\n\nI think we think of them\n\nmore of delayed gratification always.\n\nWe say, you're poor, you just need to solve your problem,\n\nthen, once you become non-poor, you can go buy your TV.\n\nThis guys knows that he's going to be poor all his life,\n\nand he wants something other than eating, whatever,\n\nboiled grains.\n\nSo he wants some pleasure,\n\nand if that means you starve sometimes,\n\nyou starve sometimes.\n\nI think the space, the need for pleasure\n\nin this very stressful, deprived existence\n\nis something we, as economists, never really accept.\n\nBut pleasure is extraordinarily important\n\nin understanding how people behave,\n\nreal people in real circumstances.\n\nAnd Geoff, you grew up not next to a slum, but in a slum,\n\nif I can use that word.\n\n[Geoff] Yes, yes.\n\nAnd then you devoted your career\n\nto working with people who lived in the kind of place\n\nthat you grew up.\n\nWere there any surprises once you began to work with them,\n\nor had your own childhood and youth\n\ngiven you a complete education in what they were up against?\n\nWell, this is what happened,\n\nand I just can't agree more about the impact of poverty\n\nand stress on your ability to make decisions\n\nwhich other folk look at say, how did you do that?\n\nAnd they'll write about their theories,\n\nbut they don't have a clue\n\nabout all of the underlying dynamics that go into that.\n\nBut let me, when I finished graduate school,\n\nI started working in Boston.\n\nAnd I started working in, and this was during\n\nthat Boston was going through desegregation,\n\nit was a very complicated time,\n\nand I ended up working in a school, a high school,\n\nthat the kids from the traditional public schools\n\nhad been kicked out.\n\nAnd this was mostly kids who were on the front lines\n\nof, as shock troops, during the busing crisis.\n\nThese were the kids throwing the bricks\n\nat the black kids on the bus,\n\nand I was sort of their first black teacher,\n\nand I describe my first day teaching in this classroom\n\nas the teacher's equivalent of Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?\n\nRight?\n\n(audience and panelists laugh)\n\nThe kids took one look at me,\n\nand said we didn't bargain for this.\n\nExcept they weren't Katherine Hepburn\n\nand Spencer Tracy, right?\n\nBut this is what I saw and this really stunned me.\n\nThose kids saw the world the same way\n\nas the black kids saw the world when I grew up.\n\nAnd I had never been around white poor kids\n\nin my entire life because I grew up in the South Bronx,\n\nit was all segregated.\n\nI went to Bowdoin,\n\nthere weren't a lot of poor white kids at Bowdoin,\n\nthere weren't a lot of poor white kids at Harvard,\n\nand so I had this image, right?\n\nI had this image of what it meant to be white.\n\n[George] They're all doin' okay.\n\nRight, that the reality of these kids\n\nand talkin' with them, in no time at all,\n\neven these kids who were racist and everything,\n\nthey realized I had so much more in common with them\n\nthan the teachers and the other folks\n\nbecause of my experience of poverty.\n\nI actually understood what it felt to feel marginalized\n\nand not be able to leave your community,\n\nthink everybody's talkin' about you everywhere you go,\n\nto feel hopeless, right, and to do things\n\nthat we all say, well why would you do that?\n\nWhy would you risk your whole life\n\nbecause whole for us and whole for them\n\nwere two totally different things,\n\nand so this idea that there was something about poverty\n\nthat was universal, that often it was described\n\nand understood by race, was something that back in the '70s\n\nI said wait a second, we got an issue here going on.\n\nSo this is what has surprised me, I think,\n\nin doing the work that I'm doing now,\n\nis that the resistance to dealing with solutions\n\nthat suggest adults have to do something different, right,\n\nto be successful with these young people\n\nI find just stunning.\n\nI just simply thought there were no solutions,\n\nand then, if you have solutions,\n\nI thought everyone would say great, let's do that,\n\nlet's fix this.\n\nThe commitment to fix the issues\n\nand deal with this issue seriously in this country,\n\nI think, is something that even today I find shocking\n\nbecause quite honestly, I think it undermines our democracy\n\nin lots of ways that are important, right?\n\nAnd this is not republican, this is not democrat,\n\nthis is none of that stuff.\n\nHaving a society based on equal access,\n\nfairness, a level playing field,\n\nis something that I think we risk\n\nwhen we have huge numbers of young people\n\ngrowing up outside of that system.\n\nAnd doesn't it also challenge\n\na fundamental belief most Americans can grow up with\n\nwhich is that any individual can make it\n\nif they work hard enough?\n\nI think that Americans believe that,\n\nand when you get to the places\n\nthat it is clear that that is not true,\n\nyou find out that there are really\n\na couple of different kinds of America going on.\n\nAnd I think one of the reasons that\n\nAmericans don't understand is that\n\nyou can basically live your life as a caring,\n\nsensitive person and never experience what it's like\n\nto really interact with poor people,\n\nand it's not because you've done anything wrong,\n\nit's because we have isolated this problem\n\nand marginalized it to the place that\n\nunless you intentionally go out\n\nand live in a Mumbai slum,\n\nyou are just not gonna come in contact with folk\n\nin a way that helps you understand some of the challenges\n\nthat they're dealing with.\n\nAnd so I think\n\nthat we have sort of allowed this to happen away from us\n\nand don't feel like this problem is as big as it is.\n\nIn a way, in this country,\n\neverything is left and right today and poverty,\n\nthe left says not enough money, not enough jobs.\n\nThe right says not enough good behavior.\n\nNot enough family values.\n\nI don't agree with that for this reason.\n\nWith which?\n\nNo, no, with the left.\n\nI agree with you with the right.\n\nI don't agree with you with the left.\n\nI think the left has also been saying\n\nthis is really about a set of values and standards\n\nand other issues, and I've been worried\n\nthat the left has moved much closer to the right\n\nin thinking about poverty,\n\nand we're supposed to understand\n\nwhen they used these code words\n\nthat they're really talkin' about poverty,\n\nbut they're not gonna talk about poverty.\n\nWhen did that happen,\n\nbecause William Julius Wilson set the marker\n\nfor the idea that when jobs disappear,\n\npoverty is what follows.\n\nThat is a more economic view.\n\nSo do you think more recently, the left has embraced\n\nthe cultural and the psychological and the moral?\n\nI think, look, you and I both think of Bill Wilson's work\n\nwas seminal, it was important, it laid out,\n\nI don't find most folk really both know the work\n\nor understand what he was talkin' about, right?\n\nAnd so I don't think that penetrated very deeply\n\ninto the American understanding about how\n\nthe lack of access to jobs really changes the whole dynamics\n\nin the community, in the family.\n\nPeople are still ascribing these issues\n\nto values and social issues\n\nversus the big economic challenges that families face\n\nwhen men can't work, right?\n\nAnd not for a year or two, for decades,\n\nand what happens to the family structure\n\nand all of those other kinds of things.\n\nAnd so I don't think we've ever accepted\n\nBill Wilson's understanding of some of these dynamics.\n\nOkay.\n\nI wanna shift a bit here\n\nand ask both Jose and Kate to talk about\n\nwriting about poor people, writing about immigrants,\n\nwhich are not exactly the same thing,\n\nalthough in this country, undocumented immigrants\n\ntend to be pretty poor,\n\nand you both have a background in journalism,\n\nbut I think you've kind of moved in different directions.\n\nKate, you never appear in your work.\n\nThere's like, who?\n\nWait, you were at the bus stop\n\nwith the black woman in Oklahoma City\n\nwho could not flag down the bus.\n\nDid you try?\n\n(panelists chuckle)\n\nNo.\n\nWith Kim, you know?\n\nI can imagine you kind of hiding behind a tree\n\nso that you wouldn't affect the outcome oF the story.\n\nA tree was involved, yeah.\n\nIn Behind the Beautiful Forevers,\n\nthis marvelous account that feels in every good sense\n\nlike you're reading fiction of the lives of people\n\nwhose languages you couldn't speak.\n\nWhat about the blonde woman\n\nwho kept walking in the slum every morning\n\nand staying there all day?\n\nWhat effect did she have?\n\nYou wrote a very eloquent author's note\n\nexplaining why you're not there.\n\nJose, you have kind of stepped forward\n\nand said this is actually my story.\n\nVery uncomfortably, I should say.\n\n[George] Sorry?\n\nVery uncomfortably.\n\n[George] Why?\n\nBecause I grew up, everything I learned about journalism\n\nI learned from reading.\n\nI wasn't a journalism major at all.\n\nI wasn't even supposed to go to college.\n\nSo, I (chuckles) the New Yorker\n\nhas kind of been my Bible in that way.\n\nAnd when I got to The Post, Katherine Boo,\n\nmost of her articles,\n\nespecially in The Washington Post Magazine,\n\nI was like, who?\n\nIn some ways, I don't wanna embarrass,\n\n'cause Kate's sitting right here,\n\nI literally would just read them like religiously\n\nto learn how to not be invisible,\n\nbut to learn how to create that space\n\nin which people can be\n\nspecific and universal at the same time, right?\n\nAnd when I came out and started, for me as a writer,\n\nthe three most dangerous words are I, me, and my,\n\nand now that I'm like a year and a half into this,\n\nthat's the space that I'm occupying.\n\nIt's very uncomfortable for me.\n\nAnd I still find myself, thank god for James Baldwin\n\nand Joan Didion, like I do a lot of just,\n\nI get lost, I pick up Notes of a Native Son,\n\nand I just start flipping, I'm like,\n\nokay, that's the language, that's the language.\n\nJust to get myself going into that way\n\nbecause that's not where I come from.\n\nThat hasn't been what I learned.\n\n[George] You learned the language of essay writing.\n\nThe language of essay writing,\n\nand I feel like I've gone to this new thing\n\nin which I have to earn the right to say I.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nLike I have to justify that this isn't self-serving,\n\nthat I'm speaking to the greater truth.\n\nIs part of the uncomfortableness\n\nthat you have a strong view about the subject\n\nand in fact you're trying to push the conversation\n\nand maybe even the policy in a certain direction\n\nwhile you're covering it?\n\nLook, I'm not privileged enough\n\nto be a democrat or republican, I've never voted.\n\nI can't.\n\nAnd in some ways, as somebody who's Filipino,\n\nwho's undocumented, who's gay,\n\nI've never been privileged enough to be objective.\n\nI always come from a point of view,\n\nbut as a journalist, I think the training has always been,\n\nI remember when I was covering the 2008 election\n\nand going to Ohio to follow Sarah Palin\n\nand interviewing people who really, truly believed\n\nthat Obama was Muslim, and sitting down with them\n\nin front of Google, as they like Obama, Muslim,\n\nhere are the sources.\n\nAnd you're like, wait up a second,\n\nso you don't trust The Washington Post\n\nand The New York Times, and Politifact.\n\nNo, no, no, we don't trust that.\n\nThey read this other stuff, and to sit there and like,\n\nwhy you coming from that point of view,\n\nand then taking it not to this work,\n\nwhich is like sitting down with very anxious, angry,\n\nworking class, poor, white people who want someone to blame,\n\nwho need someone to blame,\n\nand now they've turned to\n\n[George] You're a pretty juicy target.\n\nAnd I'm standing there, right in front of 'em.\n\nAnd I'm like, sir, my life, I am not a threat to you.\n\nWe live in the same country.\n\nThis is the big thing I like to talk about people is like,\n\nso there are about two million undocumented young people\n\nin this country, what we call dreamers, undocumented youth.\n\nWe can't all serve you drinks and babysit your kids\n\nand mow your lawns.\n\nWhat do you want to do with us?\n\nWhen we were in Alabama last year,\n\nI'm going back again later this month.\n\nYou know, Alabama actually out-Arizona-ed Arizona.\n\nAlabama has the worst immigration law in the country.\n\nThe irony, here we are.\n\nBe in Birmingham for about a few days,\n\nI'm going back again later this month,\n\nyou would think, by the way the way people talk,\n\nthe people that I interviewed in Birmingham,\n\nthat you would think that J-Lo had encamped\n\nin the middle of town, the way they talked about Hispanics.\n\nAs if they're everywhere.\n\nBirmingham is like five percent Hispanic, right?\n\nAnd yet they've created this idea,\n\nthat there they are at Wal-Mart speaking Spanish.\n\nI remember this one guy telling me,\n\nI don't understand\n\nwhy they all have to live in the same house.\n\nI'm like, what?\n\nI drove past this house, and there's like seven cars.\n\nI'm like, why are you driving by the house?\n\n(audience chuckles)\n\nI'm telling you, if we do not address,\n\nback to what you were saying here,\n\nif we do not address this white working class anxiety\n\nand try to unpack where that's coming from,\n\nand the fact that they've been mostly invisible\n\nin the coverage of poverty, right,\n\nI think we are in\n\nfor a very uncomfortable couple of decades.\n\nKate, have you ever wanted to write essays or op-eds?\n\nHave you ever wanted to take\n\nall the reporting you've done over the years\n\nand turn it into a diatribe or proposal?\n\nYeah.\n\nFor me, I have bad hands,\n\nand I have some medical issues,\n\nand so for me, it's always a question\n\nof what can I do that everybody else isn't doing?\n\nBecause what's the point?\n\nI mean, if I can only have a limited amount\n\nof time and effort to invest,\n\nam I gonna choose the thing that I think\n\nthat's most important?\n\nAnd so I choose to spend long periods of time\n\nwith low-income people and listen to them\n\nand try to bring that to the public, I suppose.\n\nAlso, it's something that I think that I can do pretty well,\n\nwhere you're much better at writing notes and comments.\n\nBut the other thing that I think\n\nis that, with why I keep myself out of my work,\n\nthere are many, many reasons,\n\nand I have all these other alternate books in my head.\n\nAnd graphic novels and humiliating comics\n\nof my experience as a reporter,\n\nbut I feel like when you're writing about,\n\nthe issues that I care about most aren't necessarily things\n\nthat people just wake up in the morning dying to read.\n\nAnd you have a very limited amount of space\n\nthat the reading public is gonna give you.\n\nAnd so my hope is, I don't want to be the broker\n\nin the middle of the book\n\nsaying look at this nice boy named Abdul\n\nwho sorts garbage and supports a family of 11\n\non things that other people throw away.\n\nI want you to meet Abdul directly.\n\nI want you to make your own judgement.\n\nI want you to use the limited space\n\nthat I have allotted to me to bring you closer\n\nto this person who you ordinarily wouldn't meet\n\nbecause I can sit on a stage and I can tell you\n\nwhat I think about it, you know, who I am.\n\nBut he's not on the stage.\n\nBut is there a point of view?\n\nIs there an implied argument behind The Beautiful Forevers?\n\nI mean, I think it's that my values\n\ninform what I choose to write about.\n\nBut when I'm reporting, I try to write what I see.\n\nDo you worry that people read about the poor\n\nin the way that they might give a quarter\n\nto someone on the subway?\n\nIn other words, it's sort of an act of self-cleansing,\n\nand then they can move on and read about J-Lo?\n\nI mean, you know what I'm asking.\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\n[George] People read your work, but.\n\nDoes reading a book inoculate them from doing something?\n\nWell, for me, it's always the question of\n\nis it better than nothing?\n\nIf a few people are gonna read my book,\n\nor I love Poor Economics,\n\nand a few people are gonna read that and start thinking\n\nnow really, what can I do?\n\nWhat small thing can I contribute to this fairness equation?\n\nAnd you can never control how your book is gonna be read.\n\nHow was it read in Annawadi, or was it?\n\nIt was, it was read.\n\nAnd by the people who could read English,\n\nand then they talked about it.\n\nI got good reviews in Annawadi, in fact.\n\n(panelists chuckle)\n\nActually, the best review I ever got in my life\n\ncame from a young woman name Manju,\n\nif anybody's read the book, she's in it.\n\nAnd newspaper reporters came there,\n\nand they said, do these people really exist,\n\ndid this happen?\n\nThey did some fact-checking after the fact,\n\nand she said, what she wrote is what I am.\n\nAnd I was really honored by that.\n\nAbhijit, what role if any does the kind of work Kate does\n\nplay in your work?\n\nDo you turn to narrative journalism for insight,\n\nor is it kind of a separate way of looking at this,\n\nand what you're looking at is based on tests and studies?\n\nI mean, absolutely.\n\nJust to go back to your question to Kate before,\n\nI think nobody could read Kate's book for expression.\n\nIt drags you through the mud for so long\n\nand with such compulsion that you could never read it\n\njust to get it out of the system.\n\nIt's a book that doesn't leave you alone.\n\nIt stays in your system.\n\nAnd I think that,\n\nfor me, I think what's very important\n\nabout books like Kate's, but other books I've read,\n\nGeorge Orwell is my hero, and so I've probably read\n\nRoad to Wigan Pier and Down and Out in Paris and London\n\nfive times, before I wrote the book,\n\nI read them over and over and over again.\n\nIn some sense, what I find very powerful\n\nabout those narratives is they give a psychological reality\n\nto what, as academics, especially social scientists,\n\nour real weakness is that we can build a story\n\nbut then we can't really fill in the characters\n\nin the story, so we can build a stage.\n\nWe can put some cardboard characters on it,\n\nbut then we can't get them to move.\n\nAnd what happens is when you have someone like Kate writing,\n\nyou see how to think about the way\n\nthey would move on the stage if you like.\n\nSo it's extremely important\n\nbecause in some ways, you can then go back\n\nand think about if that's the right story,\n\nwhat do I do about it?\n\nI think stories, narratives, are very important.\n\nIn a sense, almost for me,\n\nthe only reason I was happy that I wrote Poor Economics\n\nis that it allowed me to create a narrative for myself.\n\nThe stuff I knew, the stuff as a profession we kind of knew,\n\nbut knowing something and putting them into a narrative\n\nis very different.\n\nAnd once you have a narrative,\n\nthe narrative has a life of its own.\n\nI don't need to tell you this, you're a writer,\n\nbut it's.\n\nBut I'm interested in that narrative.\n\nCan you say a few words about how it became a story\n\nand how that story became coherent for you\n\nas you wrote the book?\n\nBecause you're looking at countries all over the world,\n\nand it seems like your process is to look at them distinctly\n\nrather than as part of the same story.\n\nSo I think all good academic work\n\nstudies one thing, studies it in a great deal of depth,\n\nand we try to do careful academic work,\n\nthat's what I get paid for.\n\nAnd I think we do, we understand little bits\n\nof how do you get people to get their children immunized?\n\nI think that's a kind of problem we study,\n\nwe get some insights into it.\n\nAnd what's difficult is to take many instances like that\n\nand turn it into something will then give you insight\n\ninto other things, not immunization,\n\nbut how schools would work.\n\nAnd that shift is what we're looking for.\n\nSo, in a sense, so what I was trying to say\n\nright at the beginning that this idea\n\nof understanding a lot of the behavior of the poor\n\nin terms of the need for a space for pleasure,\n\nthe need for a way to manage stress,\n\nthis is a narrative that came, in a sense,\n\nout of the staring at the studies saying\n\nwhat are they telling me?\n\nHow can I make sense of all of them?\n\nThe whole book is like half a page about this study\n\nand half a page about that study,\n\nbut then somehow it has to come together.\n\nThat exercise is useful.\n\nI feel like you just described\n\nthe Harlem Children's Zone as well\n\nwhen you talked about school and health care\n\nand all the other things that go into the lives of the poor\n\nand the ways of trying to reach them.\n\nGeoff, do you read either academic or journalistic work\n\nabout your subject, about yourself?\n\nI mean, some of the best writing on poverty\n\nhas been about Harlem Children's Zone in this country,\n\na lot of Paul Tough's work, for example.\n\nIs it helpful to you, or is it annoying?\n\nYou know what's interesting,\n\nPaul is a gifted writer, and I am constantly trying\n\nto keep abreast of the best programmatic and scientific\n\nbreakthroughs in our field,\n\nwhich is where I spend a lot of my time.\n\nBut is spend as much time reading The Wall Street Journal\n\nand the business section of The Times\n\nbecause to me, this stuff is all connected.\n\nAnd I keep thinking in this country\n\nthat people keep trying to pull this stuff apart.\n\nAs best I can figure out.\n\n[George] In what way?\n\nThere is a shift in the economic model here\n\nin the United States.\n\nIt is both being driven by technology and globalization\n\nin ways that people are just totally disconnected from.\n\nAnd so when I was first starting my career,\n\nyou could define success\n\nby giving a kid a high school diploma\n\nbecause if you looked at the outcome for kids\n\nwho had a high school diploma, it was so much better,\n\nso that was what you needed to do.\n\nToday, no one knows what you're gonna do\n\nwith a kid with a high school diploma.\n\nThat has changed, those jobs have gone,\n\nthe skill levels have increased so dramatically,\n\nbut the system is still actin' like that's the benchmark,\n\nand we can meet that benchmark, and kids will be fine.\n\nThat's why you've said before\n\nthat the test of success for what you do\n\nis graduating college.\n\nYou gotta graduate from college.\n\nNow, there's a group of folk who argue against that.\n\nCollege is not for everybody.\n\nAnd the only problem I've ever had with that,\n\nand some of them are academic scholars and others,\n\nif you ask 'em is college for your child?\n\nThey would say, of course.\n\nAnd I've never heard one of 'em say\n\ncollege is not for my child.\n\nThe everybody is really about my kids,\n\nthat's really what they mean.\n\nAnd I tell folk, when in doubt,\n\ndo what rich people do, right?\n\n(audience laughs)\n\nI've never met a rich person who did not think\n\ncollege was a minimum requirement for their child, right?\n\nSo this idea of how you have a set of values,\n\n'cause obviously, whatever your target is, right,\n\nyou're gonna hopefully get somewhere around\n\na normal curve on that target, right?\n\nMost of the kids will get there, some won't,\n\nbut if you set the target so low\n\nthat by setting the target you have defined failure,\n\nwell, obviously you know what you're gonna end up with,\n\nmost of the kids failing,\n\nand that's where I think we've developed these systems,\n\nso I think that if we refuse to deal with the fact\n\nthat the target level has moved up,\n\nthat the mediocre response we have to lousy schools\n\nand tepid economic reforms will continue in this country\n\nbecause people feel like it's not that big of a deal.\n\nI think it's a huge deal,\n\nand we've gotta sort of wake America up about that.\n\nAbhijit, your work is overseas,\n\nbut I'm sure you know a fair amount\n\nabout what Geoff does, and others in this country.\n\nSo I'm just wondering, his approach,\n\nwhich is integrated, which is about creating a web\n\nthat sort of encompasses the whole of this community,\n\nhow would you test it?\n\nHow would you set up a test for its success\n\nor its efficacy?\n\nJust to understand your method.\n\nSo this is actually a test of Geoff's work.\n\nMy friend Roland Fryer has been working with them\n\nfor many years, and Roland has studied, for example,\n\nthere was a lottery, I think, for kids\n\nwho wanted to get into the Harlem, what's it called?\n\n[Geoff] Children's Zone.\n\nChildren's Zone, and the lottery,\n\nwhat's nice about a lottery is that if you win the lottery,\n\nyou're not different, except for the fact that you won it,\n\nfrom the ones that lost the lottery,\n\nand as a result, you track those kids,\n\nthe ones who got in and didn't get in,\n\nand look a the difference, and you see what happened,\n\nand he finds enormous differences in their lives,\n\nso I think that's sort of how you would test.\n\nNow, there's other things there\n\nthat are more complicated,\n\nwhich embrace the entire community.\n\nNow, of course, that's much harder to test\n\nbecause there is no second Geoff,\n\nand that's sort of what makes it harder to test.\n\nThere is no replication of that,\n\nso you can certainly test the effect on individual kids.\n\nCan you test, is there another 97 blocks somewhere\n\nin an extraordinarily poor part of a very rich country\n\nwhich you could compare with it?\n\nNo.\n\nWhere is a guy who also has a six degree black belt\n\nin tae kwon do.\n\n(audience laughs)\n\nAnd writes really well.\n\nThat's a bit more of a challenge.\n\n[Geoff] Can I just?\n\n[Goerge] Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nSome of this research, and Roland is a real researcher,\n\nand they're doing a second iteration of the work,\n\nand I think it's gonna be really exciting,\n\nsome of the stuff they're finding.\n\nBut you're right about the ability\n\nto test whether or not these other supports and services\n\nwe're doing are providing a meaningful, measurable impact\n\nfor young people.\n\nBut, and I said it to Roland,\n\nand I say it to other folk, but who cares?\n\nBecause we know.\n\nAnyone who's had a child, if you said,\n\ndo you think it matters if a bunch of kids\n\nare gonna beat your child up?\n\nAnd someone walks that child past those kids\n\nand allows them to be safe?\n\nDo you think that's gonna help with their geometry score?\n\nAnd you would say, who cares?\n\nWho would let a child, right, in America experience that,\n\nsimply because we can't figure out how to test or measure.\n\nYou mean there's a moral imperative.\n\nYou know what, the part of the challenge is,\n\nso great, I'm glad the numbers and the academic stuff\n\nare reasonable and measurable\n\nbut people have said so why do you do that other stuff?\n\nAnd we do the other stuff because we're Americans,\n\nwe care about our children, and we know better\n\nthan to allow children to grow up thinking\n\nthat this not one society.\n\nThinking that they are illegal.\n\nThinking that we are holding something against them\n\njust because of where they live.\n\nAnd I think that to the degree that this country\n\nunderstands that our children\n\nare really the future of this country,\n\nand people at my age are not gonna be the ones\n\nwho are gonna be leading America in 15 years,\n\nand it's probably gonna be\n\nmany children who are black and brown,\n\nif you just look at the demographics in this country,\n\nI think that we have to say what kind of world\n\ndid we leave these kids?\n\nWhat sense of values\n\nbecause they're not only gonna be leading this country,\n\nthere's a chance they're gonna be leading\n\nin the rest of the world,\n\nand so a part of this is,\n\nI think we absolutely should measure some things,\n\nbut some of the stuff we're doing, I think,\n\njust falls underneath human decency\n\nand how we treat our children, and that's the part\n\nthat I wanna make sure that people understand\n\nwhile I think it makes a difference, I'm not doing it\n\nbecause I think that's why it'll make a difference.\n\nYou just don't let kids suffer\n\nand be fearful and intimidated and feel hopeless\n\nand then say, you know, but if I teach them algebra,\n\nthey're gonna be able to go to college.\n\nI just don't think that's the way you wanna have a country\n\nand say that it's an equal country, right?\n\n'Cause I know there's a bunch of other kids,\n\nonly 20 blocks away from my zone,\n\nthat aren't dealing with any of these things\n\nand my kids are gonna have to compete with them.\n\nAnd if anybody thinks that's a level playing field,\n\nI know some apartments you can move into\n\nand switch with my kids\n\nand put them in your apartment, right?\n\nWe know, we know as parents, as human beings,\n\nwe know the power of community and institutions\n\non young people,\n\nand so I don't think we have to measure that.\n\nYou know, I was at the Tampa Convention,\n\nand there weren't many things said there\n\nthat would have echoed very well with this group,\n\nbut one thing that Condi Rice did say,\n\nand it kind of got a deafening silence,\n\nwas if I know from your zip code\n\nwhether you're going to get a good education or not,\n\nthen it's really not possible to speak of equal opportunity.\n\nThat was so against the message of the convention,\n\nand really of politics of this country\n\nthat it kind of baffled the delegates.\n\nBut Abhijit, you used the word replicate,\n\nand your work is sort of pushes against our tendency\n\nto want there to be a solution\n\nthat can be applied everywhere\n\nbecause a solution that worked in this community\n\nin this slum or in this village in this way\n\nwith these very small adjustments\n\nin how services are delivered\n\nmight not work if people aren't delivering services\n\nin that way or if the expectations are different\n\nor if you haven't figured out exactly why\n\npeople are refusing this offered help,\n\nI think one problem with the way poverty is talked about\n\nand is addressed is the deep frustration that comes\n\nwith finding out that there is no single solution\n\nwhen what we want is to be able to say there, got it.\n\nAnd I'm wondering, Geoff, if you worry\n\nthat, you know, Harlem Children's Zone\n\nbecame the basis for a big federal program\n\nwhich President Obama took office.\n\nI think it hasn't been funded to the extent\n\nthat he wanted it to be,\n\nbut it still tried to do in other neighborhoods\n\nwhat you've done.\n\nDo you worry, you're Superman in the documentary\n\nof that title, so do you worry\n\nthat we want you to be the answer,\n\nand that you're just not going to be the answer\n\nbecause Youngstown is not the same as Central Harlem?\n\nAnd we talk about broad principles\n\nand not programmatic responses.\n\nAnd we did that with the feds.\n\nWe also said to the Obama Administration\n\nthat we did not want this funded 100%\n\nwith government dollars, that we wanted local buy-in\n\n'cause I was afraid of the accountability issue, right?\n\nThat if it's a political program,\n\nthen it has to be successful even if it's failing\n\nbecause people have to run for re-election.\n\nBut if private individuals give money,\n\nthey actually are not gonna keep funding something\n\nthat fails, and so this idea of accountability,\n\nI think, is, now look, this is sad.\n\nIn my business, this is considered revolutionary,\n\nthat you should hold people accountable\n\nif you give them the money, right?\n\nThat in the end, if they don't deliver,\n\nyou take the money back.\n\nAnd so when I, we started the Harlem Children's Zone,\n\nI started my schools, I said to Mayer Bloomberg\n\nand the Chancellor Klein and my board,\n\nif in five years I have not created a better school\n\nthan the public schools in Harlem\n\nthat have been there in 50 years,\n\nI'm gonna fire myself.\n\nAnd everybody, they wrote it down,\n\noh, Geoff's gonna fire himself.\n\n(audience laughs) They did, they did.\n\n'Cause hey, the clock is tickin'.\n\nYou know what I told them?\n\nAll my staff, but you all know I'm the last one leaving,\n\nso the idea that you can let kids fail, right?\n\n[George] First hired, right?\n\nAnd there's no penalty for failure,\n\nit's only accepted in education and social services.\n\nAnd every place else, if a business fails,\n\nthe business has to close, people leave their jobs.\n\nPeople work weekends and summers and everything else\n\nto be successful, so this seems radical,\n\nalthough people hate me for sayin' these kind of things.\n\nIf we have to work summers,\n\nwe work summers to educate our kids.\n\nThat's our job, that's what we get paid for,\n\nthat's what we have to do.\n\nHold us accountable for this.\n\nWe have been part of the idea of The Zone\n\nis to bring these very very basic, I think,\n\nbusiness solutions, right, to some of this work,\n\nand people think it's radical, it's not radical.\n\nThe system is absolutely resistant\n\nto changing at all, right?\n\nSo that's one thing.\n\nThe other thing is our zone is sort of like\n\na good emergency room, right?\n\nSo all over America, you go into any city,\n\npeople know great emergency rooms and they know places.\n\nYou say, if I have a heart attack, do not take me there\n\nbecause you know what the data says.\n\nSo what is an emergency room?\n\nYou have to be able to be nimble enough\n\nto have top people who can deal with the variety.\n\nYou don't know what's walking in the door, right?\n\nAnd if it's a heart attack, you gotta have somebody,\n\nand if it's a gunshot.\n\nWell, creating a zone requires the same set of skills\n\nas running a good emergency room.\n\nIt's not, everybody can't.\n\nYou need really talented people.\n\nYou need talented people,\n\nbut no one's given up on emergency rooms\n\nbecause some of them are lousy right,\n\nand say we don't need an emergency room.\n\nWe think that's the issue here.\n\nYes, could you have some that'll be lousy?\n\nProbably, yep, probably.\n\nBut the concept of being able to go into a community,\n\nrespond to the issues, deliver a set of services\n\nthat has clear outcomes and reach those outcomes,\n\nthere are places around the country\n\nthat can absolutely do those.\n\nJose, could you snap your fingers\n\nand find a solution to the problem\n\nof the 11 million undocumented immigrants in this country?\n\nIf you were king.\n\nIf I were king?\n\n[George] What would you do about it?\n\nIf I had papers?\n\nOh, we're beyond papers.\n\nIf you had powers.\n\nIf you had powers, what would you do?\n\nI just don't think we've had,\n\nI think the conversation has been so limited.\n\nI mean, that's why even in the essay,\n\nin my quote unquote coming out essay.\n\nAs far as I was concerned,\n\nwhat made the essay powerful such as it was\n\nwas really the story of my high school principal,\n\nand my school superintendent,\n\nand this editor of The Washington Post Peter Perl,\n\nwho ended up, Peter Perl was the guy,\n\nI got to the Post 2004, five months into it,\n\nliving in D.C., for somebody like me,\n\nI felt like I had illegal tattooed on my forehead,\n\nand I lived a few blocks from the Washington Monument\n\nand it felt like it was poking me the entire time.\n\nIt was just surreal being in D.C.\n\nAnd being in this situation.\n\nI had to tell somebody, so I told this guy, Peter Perl,\n\nwho's an editor there,\n\nand I expected Peter Perl to say, all right,\n\nwe gotta report you now.\n\nWe gotta go to the editor in H.R. and fix this.\n\nI was prepared for that.\n\nWhat he said instead was first thing,\n\nyou make so much more sense,\n\n'cause I guess I was always so tightly wound up.\n\nSecond thing, it's now our shared problem.\n\nDon't tell anybody else.\n\nCan you imagine how many other Peter Perls\n\nare sitting right now across the country\n\nwho are helping engineers, accountants, students.\n\nWe don't hear about them.\n\nWe don't hear about if we teamed up,\n\nevery undocumented youth in this country\n\nhas a teacher or a principal.\n\nOne of the best stories, I was interviewing this kid,\n\nhe's not really a kid, he's 23,\n\nfive weeks, about a month ago now, Korean kid,\n\nwho can't drive because he doesn't have a license,\n\nand so his pastor was the one who bought him a bike\n\nso he can go to school.\n\nI'm like, I wanna talk to that pastor.\n\nI want America to hear from that pastor.\n\nWhen I was in Alabama, I interviewed a guy\n\nnamed U.W. Clemon, he was the first African American\n\nappointed to the federal judge, to serve federal judge,\n\nin the state of Alabama.\n\nAnd he has done enough talking among the activists\n\nthat he actually said to us\n\nthat because of this law in Alabama,\n\nthe Hispanic man is the new negro.\n\nSir, can you please get on television and say that?\n\n(chuckles)\n\nI want this issue, you do not have to be Hispanic or Asian\n\nto talk about immigration in America.\n\nUnless we insist that white people and black people,\n\namong everybody else, has a role.\n\nI mean, let's look at the Civil Rights Movement, right?\n\nIt wasn't until white people started saying\n\nwait up a second, that's my brother,\n\nthat's my sister, right?\n\nIt wasn't until straight people, right?\n\nI mean, to me, Will and Grace\n\nwas a really interesting cultural tipping point\n\nin which all of a sudden it wasn't just about Will\n\nit became about Grace.\n\nEverybody has a gay roommate, everyone has a gay brother\n\nor a gay sister.\n\nHow do we take that kind of concept\n\nand take it to immigration and say, you know us.\n\nWe are completely integrated in this country.\n\nWe are invisibly visible,\n\nand unless we as a society\n\nis actually willing to talk about that and unpack that\n\nand talk about race and talk about class.\n\nOne last anecdote, I was in the University of Georgia\n\nin Athens, which I didn't know\n\nwas such a conservative university.\n\nI came like a college republican kind of event.\n\nAnd we ended up talking and the college president\n\nended up a little bit interrogating me, which was great.\n\nAnd at one point I said to him,\n\nremember that time between 1892 to like 1956\n\nwhen like 12 million undocumented white people from Europe\n\ncrossed the border called the Atlantic Ocean\n\nand landed on Ellis Island without papers?\n\nHe was like, what are you talkin' about?\n\nI mean, let's talk about that.\n\nUnless you're African American or Native American,\n\nwe call came here from somewhere.\n\nAnd so I was like, so where you from?\n\nAnd he's like, I'm American.\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nI'm white.\n\nWhite is not a country, where are you from?\n\nI don't know.\n\nCan you find out, and then we'll talk about it? (chuckles)\n\nOne more question, and then we're gonna set up mics\n\nand have your questions, so be prepared with them,\n\nand maybe we can get microphones set up\n\na the foot of each aisle here.\n\nKate, you're the one person among the four of you\n\nwho has talked to poor people, written about poor people,\n\nstudied poor people in the U.S. and overseas.\n\nIs it the same?\n\nCan you generalize, can you universalize?\n\nIs it radically different?\n\nAre we having two different conversations here?\n\nWell, what's different is obvious\n\nand what strikes me is the same.\n\nAnd one of the things we were talking about earlier\n\nabout the psychological effect of being poor.\n\nOne of the things I've seen change so much\n\nin the 25 years I've been doing this kind of work\n\nis the way in which inequality and juxtaposed inequality\n\nand the ability of poor people because of television media\n\nto understand what it looks like on the other side.\n\nThe kind of deep self-loathing that happens.\n\nSo it's not just the people with power ignore the poor,\n\neven the poor, they don't even wanna be in that club.\n\nAnd in some ways, they're hidden to each other\n\nas much as they're hidden to the rest of us.\n\nAnd in my book, I talk about this teenager named Merchi\n\nwho describes the slum,\n\nwhich is surrounded by luxury hotels.\n\nAnd he says everything around us is roses,\n\nand we're the shit in between.\n\nAnd if that doesn't tell you the way\n\nthat people are looking at their own communities,\n\nnothing does.\n\nAnd I hear it over and over again in wherever I go\n\nin the Unites States, in Europe, in the U.K., in India,\n\nthat more and more people this added burden\n\nof being ashamed of their position\n\nrelative to the amount--\n\nDo you think you'd find that in a village in rural India?\n\nI mean, is this about globalization\n\nand about the modern world\n\nand about what they know people say about them\n\nand how they see themselves in relation to the people\n\ngetting out at the airport?\n\nWell, you know, right now, even remote Indian villages\n\nhave televisions, too.\n\nI mean, really, more than ever in human history\n\ndo people who have nothing have a sense\n\nof the contours of wealth.\n\nAnd it's a very interesting thing.\n\nAnd you would think that that would create\n\nfor some incredibly bloody insurrections,\n\nbut in America and so many other places,\n\nwhat's really interesting to me,\n\nis the way that those internal contradictions are resolved.\n\nAnd why so many of these unequal societies\n\ndon't actually implode.\n\nAnd I think that has to do in part\n\nby the way that poor people turn against each other\n\nand turn against themselves internally.\n\nYou must have some questions\n\nfor these four incredible people.\n\nI don't see anyone at a mic yet,\n\nbut if you could line up at the mics,\n\nwe will get your questions.\n\nYeah?\n\n[Woman] Someone said, the poor,\n\nyou will always have with you,\n\nand my question is how important is it\n\nto those of us who have money to have others who are poor?\n\nBecause I agree with you about the two parties.\n\nAlmost anyone could have said,\n\nyou don't really care about the 47%.\n\n[Jose] Go ahead, Geoff.\n\nWell, look No, I'm kidding.\n\n(all laugh)\n\nWell, look, some of this is, some of this is,\n\na culture that has glorified both consumption and possession\n\nto a level that I don't think,\n\nand it's global, and I have young people who feel poor\n\nif they don't have a Rolex, right?\n\nForget having a watch, right?\n\nBut this idea that that watch,\n\nthe watch is actually a status of how poor you are\n\nversus the ability to think about, I think,\n\nthis sort of glorification of these extensive trappings.\n\nSo now, when I was growing up, there was no luxury jeans,\n\nthere were just dungarees.\n\nNow, everybody want dungarees.\n\nNow, you have class status based on brands and other things\n\nso I can find kids who feel poor\n\nwhile they're wearing $600 worth of clothing.\n\nAnd you just look and say, well how is that happening,\n\nand part of it is, I think a glorification of consumption,\n\nand when you listen to our political leaders\n\nsaying and go borrow and spend and buy more of this stuff,\n\nit's not hard to understand how folks\n\nsort of get into this idea that you really are,\n\nyour worth is really something that has to be visible\n\nto the outside world.\n\nAnd I think that that's a real problem,\n\nand I think it drives this sense among folk\n\nthat this is really about what you own\n\nversus who you are.\n\nAnd I think the poor are just as amenable\n\nto that set of beliefs as anyone else.\n\nYou know, I just happened to be watching\n\nthe Carter Malaise speech the other day on YouTube.\n\nThis is how I spend my afternoons,\n\nand it's an incredible speech if you watch it,\n\nand in it, he denounced consumption and self-indulgence.\n\nAnd we all know what happened to Jimmy Carter.\n\nI don't think any president\n\nor anyone who aspires to leadership\n\nis gonna talk in that way in our country today.\n\nSo over here.\n\n[Man] One of the values of Kate's work and Jose's work\n\nis seeing the uniqueness of individuals\n\nand understanding how complex their situations are.\n\nBut ultimately, policy is a really blunt instrument,\n\nand so I'm wondering how, once we've understood\n\nthe complexity and the individuality of it,\n\nhow do we think about policy when, for instance,\n\nthe average impact of microcredit is zero.\n\nHow should we think about a policy with low average impact\n\nbut obviously does help some people\n\nand the situations are really complex?\n\nWell, I think Kate and Abhijit\n\nshould answer that question.\n\nWell, microfinance is a really interesting example,\n\nand one of the ways, when you're reporting from\n\nthe so-called ground, so-called field,\n\npart of what you're trying to do in your own mind,\n\nor I am, in any way, is to have a conversation\n\nwith the policy makers and the people, the philanthropists\n\nwho have the resources to actually change the world.\n\nPart of what good policy makers want\n\nis an understanding of how good intentions at the top\n\nget subverted before they get to the poor people's\n\nside of the street.\n\nAnd in Annawadi and in many other places\n\nthat I looked at in India, microfinance was being used by\n\nthe slightly better off people in poor communities\n\nto further exploit the worst off people\n\nin those communities.\n\nAnd that doesn't mean that microfinance is worthless.\n\nWhat it means is that you need to know\n\nwhat's happening in these communities\n\nso that you can think about how to make the system\n\nless easily gamed.\n\nI mean, and I see that over and over again in this country\n\nand in wherever I go, is that so often,\n\nit's not really a matter of,\n\nit's not about maligned intentions,\n\nit's about the fact that we don't take\n\nanti-poverty strategy seriously enough\n\nto get it right and to, you're talking about accountability\n\nfor Harlem Children's Zone, and it's the same thing.\n\nIt exists mainly for people on podiums\n\nto talk about the program they're sponsoring\n\nthan it is to actually think about\n\nhow it is enacted on the ground.\n\nYeah, so just to, I think, you exactly agree\n\nwith what Kate said, but just to add to that,\n\nI think the point about complexity\n\nis not that we could not think of policies\n\nthat we will pursue, but we need to recognize\n\nthat we can't just impose a structure\n\nand assume that it's going to go that way.\n\nI think that a nice example of that\n\nis there's almost a mechanical equation\n\nof the poor and the starving,\n\nand if you look at the one thing,\n\nand so there's lots of policy based on the idea\n\nthat the poor have to be the starving.\n\nOne thing that people don't seem to notice\n\nis the poor don't behave as if they're starving.\n\nSo if you give them an extra dollar,\n\nthey spend most of that on things other than, you know,\n\nwhatever, the banana, or the boiled egg\n\nthat's good to give the maximum nutrition.\n\nThat's not what they want.\n\nAnd, so I don't think the point about complexity\n\nis that is policy paralysis, I think you're exactly right\n\nin raising that question.\n\nI think the point about it is that\n\nwe shouldn't make policy at home\n\nwithout checking with the world,\n\nand I think we all too often do.\n\nThere's a very nice example I just heard\n\nin one of the states of India, they made up a policy\n\nthat every child will be weighed.\n\nAnd they made teams of five people per district to do that.\n\nSomebody did a simple calculation,\n\nwhich nobody had done, which is that\n\nif you just take the number of children,\n\ndivide by the number of people who are there checking them,\n\nyou would have to have at least 2,400 minutes per day\n\nto do it, and there aren't 2,400 minutes in a day.\n\nSo these policies are made without any regard\n\nto the reality they're supposed to impact.\n\nAnd of course they don't work.\n\nAnd you know, sometimes people don't wanna know.\n\nYou both, Geoff and Abhijit, have found that\n\npoor people don't always do the right thing.\n\nYou need to give free movie passes\n\nto get parents to sign up their kids\n\nfor some of your programs.\n\nYou found that if free cell phone minutes are added\n\nto people's cell phones in Pakistan,\n\nthey might be more likely to take preventative medicines.\n\nOnce you're there, it doesn't give the world\n\nthe right picture, it gives a picture of people\n\nwho are actually not helping themselves,\n\nand maybe helping poor people or writing about\n\ndoing policy work don't wanna know that\n\nbecause it doesn't really help their cause.\n\nWell, I think that this idea of being a slave\n\nto a strategy, even when the evidence on the ground\n\nsuggests the strategy is not working, right,\n\nhappens all the time.\n\nThat you're going to do something, it doesn't work,\n\ndoesn't make any sense, and no one feels like,\n\nyou know what, we shouldn't keep doing this.\n\nSometimes people keep doing it for generations!\n\nIt's absolutely stunning to me\n\nthat in our business, innovation happens so slowly,\n\nand people are so upset at failure, right?\n\nSo you do something and it fails,\n\nand then people say, well no,\n\nyou can't do anything for those people, just give up.\n\nAnd I just remind people failure sometimes leads\n\nto great inventions.\n\nI mean, no one wants to remember the palm pilot,\n\nwhich people told me, if I got that,\n\nthat was gonna solve.\n\n(audience laughs)\n\nNow, did they just stop trying to make devices\n\nbecause the palm pilot didn't work?\n\nNo!\n\nThey improved.\n\nIn our business, you get a palm pilot, it's over.\n\nThey say don't do it, it doesn't work,\n\nthrow in the towel, instead of someone saying okay,\n\nlet's figure out why this didn't work,\n\nlet's tweak it, let's understand the local conditions\n\nand make a better product, right?\n\nSo I think that's what real life people find, right,\n\nthat there's an interaction between real people and policy\n\nthat you've gotta adjust the policy,\n\nwhich people don't often wanna do.\n\nIt's worse than that.\n\nIn Poverty Action Lab, that's what we do for a living\n\nis evaluate policies,\n\nand sometimes we find they don't work.\n\nLike microcredit is one of our,\n\nand we got called names from every possible site.\n\nRight, left, center, behind, there's no side\n\nthat liked that answer.\n\n[Woman] Hi, I'm starting a book club\n\nand KIPPs Junior High School in the Bronx\n\nin a couple weeks, woo!\n\nAnd for people in the audience who don't know,\n\nevery student there is poor\n\nand every student there is not white.\n\nAnd I know I'm being naive by thinking\n\nI can make a difference,\n\nyet at the same time, I believe we all have to feel\n\nwe can make a difference.\n\nAnd I was wondering, Geoff, or anyone in the audience,\n\nif you could tell me what you think I should do\n\naside from trying to further the kids' love of literature\n\nand aside from giving them healthy yet good-tasting snacks.\n\n(all chuckle)\n\nThere was a piece, it may have been\n\nin The Wall Street Journal or The New York Times today\n\nthat talked about the kids\n\nthrowing all of the healthy stuff in the garbage, right?\n\nAll of the healthy food, right?\n\nAnd I'm one of those healthy food people,\n\nand this is where reality steps in\n\nto the best social thinking, and you gotta make adjustments.\n\nSo you know, I love KIPP, and what you all are doing,\n\nand I always say to folk that you know,\n\nnone of this work is easy.\n\nAnd when you run up against real children with real issues\n\nwho may or may not love the fact\n\nthat we are trying to save them,\n\nyou should not lose hope, right,\n\nbecause the kids don't immediately embrace\n\nwhatever we think is going to be helpful for them,\n\nwhich think is one of the big challenges of educators.\n\nThis is just what I've found.\n\nI've told my kids the truth,\n\nI try to not then say I told you so when they mess up,\n\nright, because they mess up.\n\nAnd I have found in the end, it takes kids a while\n\nbefore they come to the realization\n\nthat maybe you knew a little bit\n\nabout what you were trying to give them.\n\nThese ideas of experiences,\n\nof introducing young people to different points of view\n\nI think is absolutely critical.\n\nBecause you know these kids get trapped\n\nin their own environments, which has their own logic\n\nand the physics of that community\n\nthey think is universal,\n\nand it's really just based on the South Bronx\n\nor based in Harlem, and you wanna give kids\n\nan opportunity to see others.\n\nSo I just think none of this stuff is easy,\n\nnone of it happens fast.\n\nIn the end, things you think kids never listen to,\n\nwhen they're my age, they come back and they tell you,\n\nthank you.\n\nSometimes it's years later, they say thank you.\n\nYou know what, you told me what to do,\n\nI didn't listen, this happened,\n\nI did what you told me, my life is different,\n\nand so at that time, I thought I was failed with that kid.\n\nI said okay, chalk that one off, that one didn't work.\n\nSo some of this is not apparent immediately.\n\n[George] Yes.\n\n[Man] Jose, I believe you were arrested\n\nfor driving without a license in Minnesota yesterday,\n\nand I know that obviously.\n\n(audience laughs) Whoa, I didn't know that.\n\n[Man] And you see in Harlem and in the South Bronx, Geoff,\n\nlots of issues surrounding stop and frisk.\n\nSo what I'm kind of wondering,\n\nthe issue of reporting on marginalized people,\n\nsome poor people, it's not just a cultural difference\n\nbetween middle class and poor,\n\nbut there's also government policy\n\nand government policies that kind of serve\n\nto demonize and marginalize people.\n\nWhat impact does that play in understanding the experiences\n\nof marginalized people.\n\nSo, I'm gonna just, I originally,\n\nwhen Bill Bratton was commissioner,\n\nand we really started this real aggressive policing,\n\nI was and remain an advocate of a more restrained response\n\nbecause I think if a young person's only interaction\n\nwith law enforcement is this sort of just random stop,\n\nand you know, people think stop and frisk\n\nis just excuse me, can I pat you down for a second,\n\nnice young man?\n\nAnd that's not what this is at all.\n\nThis is humiliating, it's degrading,\n\nand it's emasculating, intentionally.\n\nAnd if you're 16 and you have this man\n\ntalking to you in ways that all of us would cringe,\n\nit changes the relationship you have\n\nwith your society and your community.\n\nAnd that's the bad stuff, and I've been tryin' to say\n\nyes, we need, it's not like we don't need to make sure\n\nthat we are preventing young people from carrying guns\n\nbecause the death rate has really been reduced dramatically,\n\nand that's important.\n\nBut this idea that you can have a universal experience\n\nof African American and mostly Latino men\n\nbeing degraded by police officers,\n\nwhich will stay with them for the rest of their lives,\n\nis something that I think is appalling.\n\nAnd so somehow you have to sort of minimize this kind of,\n\nlet me say one other thing,\n\nand this is where it gets insidious.\n\nSo this is the law.\n\nIf a police officer stops you,\n\nand you've got marijuana in your pocket.\n\nOkay, you've got two joints,\n\nand the police officer pats you down,\n\nfinds the marijuana, that's a desk ticket, right?\n\nIt's the same thing as a parking fine.\n\nIf the police officer says to you,\n\nwhat do you have in your pockets, take it out.\n\nAnd you take out the marijuana,\n\nthat's public display of drugs, and now you get arrested\n\nand you go through the system.\n\nNow listen, I tell folk if you lined up\n\na thousand white kids, right?\n\nGuess what you're gonna find?\n\n'Cause whites smoke marijuana actually more than blacks.\n\nThey would never allow that to happen.\n\nThey might say what are you doin',\n\nyou're arresting all these white kids,\n\nsending them into the system.\n\nAnd the kids have done nothing wrong.\n\nYou can do that at any college or university\n\nin America, right?\n\nYou would never allow that to happen\n\nbecause it's just bad for kids.\n\nSo the fact that this happens in the black community\n\nis driving this whole, so once you get in the system,\n\nthen now you're a number, you're a mugshot,\n\nyou've got your first arrest.\n\nYou're on your way, and then when you do that\n\nto 70, 80% of a group, that is really something\n\nthat I think is intolerable.\n\nSo it's complicated because stop and frisk\n\nactually reduces the number of guns,\n\nwhich reduces the homicides, which stops my kids\n\nfrom being killed.\n\nSo that's real.\n\nThis other universal experience\n\nis so damaging to young people in this city\n\nthat I think we gotta strike a different balance,\n\nand I've said that to both the mayor\n\nand the police commissioner.\n\n[George] Jose, do you wanna say something?\n\nI can't really comment on what happened yesterday,\n\nI'm just really glad to be here.\n\n(all laugh)\n\nLet's put it that way.\n\nBut what I can comment on\n\nis I realize I was undocumented when I was 16,\n\nand I remember actually, I went on Lou Dobbs, (chuckles)\n\na couple of months ago, just to tell him to his face.\n\nSir, whenever you use that word illegal,\n\nI want you to think of all the kids\n\nsitting cross the country listening to you say that\n\nand what that does to people,\n\nthe way they think about the fact\n\nthat you're walkin' around.\n\nWhen I was 16, which was what, 15 years ago now,\n\nmy relationship, like whenever I saw a cop,\n\nI remember being in Philadelphia.\n\nMy first internship was at Philadelphia Daily News\n\ncovering homicides.\n\nAnd at that point, I didn't have a driver's license yet,\n\nand I just basically hitch hiked and took SEPTA,\n\nwhich is the subway system to get to homicide,\n\nyou know, crime scenes.\n\nAnd it was the surreal nature of being the reporter\n\ncovering homicides and dealing with cops,\n\nand the whole time being very like. (chuckle)\n\nI've always been, even now, going through TSA,\n\nI can't, I don't even have the words to describe to you\n\nthe knot in my stomach as I'm in line.\n\nAnd I look like this.\n\nI can only imagine what happens to people\n\nwho look like Jose Antonio Vargas, who look brown.\n\nThat people would think that they may.\n\nOne of the people that I've been following,\n\nI'm doing a documentary,\n\none of the people I've been following is a kid named Victor.\n\nGrew up in Alabama,\n\ncrossed the border when he was five or six.\n\nHe's now 20, early 20s,\n\nand we did a cover photograph for Time Magazine\n\na few months ago, three months ago now.\n\nAnd it was the first time he flew,\n\nfirst time he got on a plane. (laughs)\n\nAnd we were all worried, I was on the phone with him,\n\n'cause he had never been through TSA before,\n\nso I'm coaching him now to get through TSA\n\nwithout really the proper document to get through TSA.\n\nAnd telling him that you show the passport,\n\nyou just open it, don't shake your hand,\n\njust don't shake, act like you're a student,\n\nmake sure you have a backpack on with a computer on it,\n\nso you take that out like you're a student.\n\nAnd when you pass through, 'cause you're gonna pass through,\n\neverything's gonna be fine, just don't smile.\n\nAppear like it's just the most normal thing you have done.\n\n(Geoff chuckles)\n\nAnd then when he got here. (chuckles)\n\nWhen he got here, he showed us,\n\nhe put the phone number of his lawyer under his sleeves.\n\n[George] We have time for one more question,\n\nand it's yours.\n\n[Man] George, I was thinking\n\nabout the piece you wrote last fall\n\nabout the man who came to New York from Seattle\n\nwhen considering the sort of ambiguous title of the panel,\n\nand just wondering what anyone thought\n\nthat the Occupy Movements do or don't have to do\n\nwith the issues we've been considering here.\n\n[George] Good question.\n\n[Man] Thanks.\n\n[George] And the last.\n\nOne of you wanna take that on?\n\nI'm happy to talk about anything,\n\nso I'll get into Occupy in a second, but.\n\nI wanna go down to the folk\n\nwho may actually know what they're talking about.\n\nActually, I think George, you're the one\n\nwho should talk about it\n\nbecause I wasn't in the United States at the time.\n\nI mean, Occupy was a comet across the landscape.\n\nIt was a mercurial thing, you felt it\n\nwhenever you went to Zuccoti Park\n\nthat it wasn't going to last in that form,\n\nbut it had crystallized and concentrated\n\na tremendous amount of experience and feeling\n\nacross the country.\n\nI used to spend hours on this website\n\nWe Are the 99%, it was a Tumblr blog\n\nthat was people posting their picture and their story\n\nand it was this outpouring of a sense\n\nthat things are, as someone had,\n\nthere were some great signs at Occupy,\n\nand one of them was Something is Wrong,\n\nand that, to me, was the most eloquent.\n\nPeople had different ideas about what that something was,\n\nand very different ideas about what could be done about it.\n\nSomething is wrong, and that is the heart of the work\n\nthat all four of you do,\n\nand I was going to ask you,\n\nwe don't have time to get the answers,\n\nbut I was gonna ask you, what keeps you doing it\n\nwhen it is so difficult?\n\nIt is the hardest work.\n\nAnd the sense that something is wrong,\n\nif that sense won't let you alone,\n\nyou will keep doing the work.\n\nAnd I think Occupy, Occupy has faded.\n\nI think it has had its moment.\n\nAnd at the time, I never expected it\n\nto turn into any kind of organization or anything,\n\nI didn't think it would become a mass movement.\n\nI think what it did was held up a sign\n\nthat said Something is Wrong,\n\nand that's an incredibly important thing.\n\nIt changed the way people talk and think.\n\nIt brought out into the open\n\nwhat many millions of people in their private lives\n\nhad experienced and felt, and so do the four of you.\n\nSo that sets me up to thank you all,\n\nnot just for being here and for giving us\n\nthis incredibly good conversation\n\nbut for what you do in your work.\n\n(audience applauds)\n\nAnd one more thing, I forgot to tell you.\n\nIf you tweet (Geoff laughs)\n\nuse hashtag NYERfest.\n\nThank you all for coming.\n\n(audience applauds)\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "What Went Wrong for Marco Rubio\n\nCarlos Barria/Reuters\n\n\"We are so excited about what lies ahead for our campaign,\" Marco Rubio told an assembled crowd in Miami on Tuesday night. This was the sort of statement Rubio has become infamous for on primary nights: optimistic, forward-looking, and completely untethered from reality. Very little lies ahead for Rubio's campaign: After winning a grand total of one state-a near superfluous Tuesday-he merely gets the opportunity to sit around and wait for Donald Trump to humiliate him in his home state of Florida two weeks from now.\n\nRubio's candidacy failed for a number of reasons. Above all, Donald Trump has emerged as a nearly unstoppable force. But there were other festering problems, from his canned answers and overprogrammed style, to the unfortunate fact that he is a youngish, Hispanic man who speaks about his hopes and dreams for America to a Republican electorate that is white, old, and hopelessly depressed about an increasingly Hispanic America. * This is the sort of thesis that is impossible to prove with data, at least for now, but it is inarguable that Rubio never captured the imagination of the people who could vote for him.\n\nBeyond demographics, part of Rubio's problem was that his substantive platform mirrored Bushism in too many ways. Foreign adventurism of the sort Rubio advocates (like much more aggressive stances against Assad and Putin) has rarely been less popular, and his other policies included (promised) giant tax cuts for the rich and (unmentioned) budget deficits for everyone else. In short, he was never able to connect with an electorate that is ready to move beyond compassionate conservatism. In his speech on Tuesday, when he had finished insulting Trump, he began speaking about issues like a strong defense of Israel, appearing once again more like a creation of Republican elites than a spokesman for average voters. Republicans have delivered a harsh verdict on traditional Republican priorities this winter, which is why Trump-who says (disingenuously) that he'd approach the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a neutral party-has been able to shunt aside GOP priorities while remaining popular with GOP voters. Rubio's political acumen, long overrated, has proven particularly lacking in this environment.\n\nAnd, of course, there was his original sin: his membership in the so-called Gang of Eight, a group of senators who worked to pass an immigration reform proposal that, it was thought, might give Republicans a chance with Hispanic voters. This would have supposedly closed the wound of the 2012 election, which Republican elites had convinced themselves was lost only because the party was too harsh in its rhetoric on the issue. Rubio's decision made no political sense even at the time; if a bill had passed, he would have had his name on Obama's biggest second-term achievement. Instead, Rubio was tarred with the details of a bill that failed, and which he abandoned, making himself look both feckless and unprincipled. (The ways in which Rubio's pro-immigration past mixed with his heritage in the minds of bigoted Republican voters is a subject for people more psychologically acute than myself.)\n\nIn the past week, as Rubio's campaign became increasingly desperate to stop Trump, he began to develop a line of attack that could perhaps damage the real estate mogul, and one that Hillary Clinton will almost certainly use in the fall. \"Donald Trump is a con artist,\" he said Tuesday night, as he had all week, promising to \"unmask the true nature of the front-runner.\" Earlier Tuesday, he called him \" Con-ald Trump .\" But Rubio's attempt to recalibrate the Trumpian narrative as one of business failure and pyramid-like schemes was undermined and eventually overshadowed by his childish attacks. Rubio mocked Trump's hair and skin color, joked about the size of his hands, and kidded that perhaps Trump had peed in his pants during a recent debate. This wasn't just demeaning; it also showed that Rubio had perhaps forgotten one of the lessons of the campaign, which, ironically, Chris Christie's attack on him proved so clearly. When Christie went after Rubio's robotic answers during that fateful New Hampshire debate, it not only destroyed Rubio's chances in the state; it also did nothing for Christie, and may even have helped his opponents. Multicandidate races are not zero-sum games: You can bring down an opponent and still not get much benefit out of doing so.\n\nAgain, it's too early to say whether Rubio's attacks on Trump backfired: Rubio outperformed his polls in Virginia, for instance. But Trump would no doubt prefer getting down-and-dirty with Rubio over hand-size than he would the details of his bankruptcies or his relationship to the laughable Trump University, two stories that might have gotten more media attention were it not for all the ink expended on Rubio's insults.\n\nFinally, there was that New Hampshire debate. After Rubio \"won\" second place in South Carolina, it seemed that perhaps his debate collapse had been overhyped: another gaffe that dominates headlines for several days without really changing much. But it's possible the initial conventional wisdom about his debate performance was correct. While there was no guarantee that he would have won New Hampshire, or would be winning states rather than losing them today, the debate performance did irreparably harm his campaign. He was polling second in New Hampshire and rising before that evening, but he finished fifth; his collapse kept John Kasich afloat, provided more oxygen for Ted Cruz, and, to conclude the mixed metaphor, gave Trump extra horsepower.\n\nIt's wishful thinking among those who dislike Trump to say that Rubio would be the presumptive nominee today if he hadn't sputtered when responding to Christie. He probably still would have failed because he wasn't the man Republicans pulling levers in 2016 wanted. Rubio's inability to take off, and the ceding of his presumptive voters to Trump, was a sign that just about everyone, Rubio included, didn't see where Trump was going-largely because they didn't get where his voters were coming from.\n\n*Correction, March 2, 2016: This post originally misidentified Marco Rubio as nonwhite. He is not nonwhite; he is Hispanic.

From the Boston Globe :\n\nPolice said Scott Leader, 38, told them it was OK to assault the man because he was Hispanic and homeless.\n\n\"Donald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported,\" he allegedly told the police.\n\n(It's not clear whether the victim of the assault is actually an undocumented immigrant.)\n\nLeader's brother Steve is the other suspect. The brothers say the Hispanic man threatened them, but a prosecutor described the attack as \"unprovoked\" and the man reportedly told police that he was woken from sleep because the two brothers were urinating on his face. He suffered a broken nose and was reportedly struck several times in the head area with a metal pole.\n\nThe Globe reached Trump for comment:\n\nTrump, told of the alleged assault, said \"it would be a shame . . . I will say that people who are following me are very passionate. They love this country and they want this country to be great again. They are passionate.\"\n\nBoth of the Leader brothers have \"extensive\" criminal records, the newspaper says. Scott Leader was convicted of a hate crime after attacking a Moroccan man and calling him a \"terrorist\" in 2001.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "What Donald Trump Means to the Bronx\n\nThe MAGA energy was palpable-in the Bronx. As emerging crowds recognized other like-minded people on the street, the chants began immediately. \" Let's Go Brandon! \" someone shouted. Another group smiled mischievously and echoed the chant, a small cacophony hinting at what was to come.\n\nThis was the Bronx like I had never seen it, and that was by design-the Trump campaign had explicitly set up his rally here in the press as aimed at Black and Hispanic voters, some of whom polls suggest are slowly warming to the former president in key states.\n\nNot everyone in the crowd was quite a convert. Marena, a Dominican and a Bronx native, had come to Crotona Park out of curiosity. She'd heard that this was where Trump was scheduled to give a speech, the first of its kind here since President Reagan visited and was heckled in 1980 . She and her friend Nicole sat on a small stone cobblestone bridge crossing a section of Indian Lake in the park, just within view of a hill where a Secret Service sniper was positioned. \"We're trying to get that glimpse!\" she said.\n\nThey didn't mind that Trump had come to their backyard. \"We live right down the block,\" she said, impressed by the enthusiasm of the crowd. \"It's a lot of people. We've never seen this many people in this park before.\"\n\nAs we chatted, a group of three white men, who stood out in a borough that is under 10 percent white, walked past. \"Where did you people come from?\" Marena called out to them. \"San Diego,\" they answered, smiling, saying they had booked a flight to New York just to see Trump speak in the Bronx. \"See? San Diego! Y'all are great supporters. They have amazing fucking energy. Like, they just came from Cali, \" she said.\n\nStill, Marena couldn't think of anyone she knew in the Bronx who supported Trump. She told me that she is a Democrat, though she qualified that by saying she finds it difficult to be enthusiastic about Biden. \"Neither one of them has my support right now,\" she said.\n\nCloser to the rally, I spotted Mike sitting alone on a bench. He is a Black Brooklyn native who came to the park from work, still dressed in his hi-vis vest and construction hard hat. He said he was waiting for the rest of his labor union, Local 78 , to show up so they could enter the rally together.\n\n\"Hopefully we get that boy Trump back in office. When he was in office the economy was good. I was working straight through the economy. Things were a lot easier financially,\" he said. He said that ever since Biden took office, he's struggled financially because while his wages are the same, everything from the grocery store to rent and other expenses has all become less affordable. \"Once the economy goes back to flourishing, if that starts to work, everything else is going to be like a domino effect,\" he said.\n\nMike said he voted for Barack Obama in 2012, but switched to being a Trump supporter after he was disappointed in how pro-LGBTQ Obama's administration was. \"I don't have nothing against them, but him empowering them didn't do nothing for us,\" he said. \"The people who hated Trump then, look at them now. They're going for Trump because we're tired of hearing people just talk.\"\n\nAs I approached the Crotona Park Amphitheatre, where thousands of Trump supporters had already gathered to see Trump speak, I saw a familiar sight: a handful of young Black and Hispanic kids having fun playing in a basketball court. They planned on entering and getting lost in the dense crowd of Trump supporters like it was a carnival. I asked about some of the anti-New York rhetoric repeated by Trump and many of his supporters, who say the city is in decline and has become overrun with violence, comments he would repeat at this rally . \"Well, they not lying. But they need to keep it moving. There's lots of blame to go around,\" one of the girls said. \"These are the same people who go, 'The Bronx is ghetto. Da da da .' Now you want to come over here because Donald Trump?\"\n\nArthur told me he'd dragged his friends along after they got off work nearby, telling them it was an opportunity to witness history. \"We're in the Bronx, like near the hoods and shit. It's so out of place,\" he said. He estimated that the crowd was about 30 percent locals, and was surprised to see that so many of Trump's supporters appeared to be nonwhite.\n\n\"I personally do not like Trump, but this is something to look at. I don't like both Biden or Trump. I'm only here to observe,\" he said. \"I'm a Democrat, but generally, I don't know, bro.\"\n\nThe line to enter the amphitheater space where Trump would deliver his speech stretched for what seemed like a mile. People waited for up to three hours to get inside the secured area. I asked a Hispanic man who waved both a small Israeli flag and a small American flag as he waited in line what he hoped to hear Trump say. Biden, he told me, \"is a traitor. He's siding with the communists, with socialists, and betraying Israel. That's not what this nation was built on. That's why this country is blessed, for siding with Israel.\"\n\nThere were many white Trump supporters present. But it was mostly a nonwhite crowd. I spotted José perched up on a barricade near the line. He told me he is originally from Honduras and now lives in the Bronx. He voted for Trump in the last election, and says he intends to again. \"We hope the other candidates come here to the Bronx,\" he said.\n\nEmmanuel, who is Black, told me he walked only two blocks to the park from his apartment to the rally. He said he personally knows many nonwhite supporters of Trump in the Bronx. \"I remember back in 2016 when I was talking about Trump, people looked at me like I have three heads. There were a few people that when we got talking, it was always whispers, hiding it. And now everybody's out with it. It's like, 'Oh wow, I'm shocked.' \"\n\nIn the line was also Phil, a white 77-year-old retired Marine Corps veteran who had been living in the Bronx for 50 years. \"I like the place,\" he said. \"If Washington left us alone, it'd be even nicer.\" He said he thought Trump has \"big cojones,\" and wasn't surprised that he would organize a rally in an area perceived to be hostile to him. \"It gets lonely sometimes,\" he said of being a Republican in the Bronx. \"When I go to vote sometimes, I'm the only one on that line. But people will change their mind when the time comes.\"\n\nAnother group of 16-year-old Black kids sprinted in my direction and enthusiastically agreed to stop for an interview. \"We want to see Trump, but this line is mad long,\" one said. Instead, they were starting conversations with the Trump supporters who had descended on their neighborhood. \"All I'm hearing is Trump, Trump, Trump ,\" one joked. Another reported more diligently, \"They're saying that they believe Trump is good for the economy and stuff.\"\n\nWe were interrupted when they spotted their social studies teacher. \"Yo, Mr. Nuriddin!\" they said as they rushed over to meet him. He rode in on his fixed-gear bike and was delighted to see his students engaging with the rallygoers. \"I'm giving you guys extra credit,\" he said. He said he talks about politics and current events in the class, and told the students about the rally and encouraged them to check it out for themselves. \"It's all critical thinking in my class. Engaging, debates, things like that,\" he said. \"He's a former president and may be the next president. It's important to see what's going on.\"\n\nNot everyone was so happy for Trump to be there. I heard \"Get the fuck out of the Bronx\" more than once, along with chants like \"Fuck Trump, fuck Biden too, they don't give a fuck about you\" from pro-Palestine protesters. Things got a bit heated briefly when pro-Israel Trump supporters came over to confront the counterprotest, waving Israeli flags and chanting \"Terrorists!\" in their direction. Bicycle-mounted police swiftly moved in to form a barrier between the two. At one point, a group of Israel supporters shouted \"Gorilla!\" at a Black counterprotester.\n\nJacob, a Queens native who is white, pro-Trump, and pro-Israel, came to the Bronx to support Trump. He said he couldn't help himself from waving a large flag that combined the Israeli and American flags in the direction of the counterprotests, but he also engaged with them actively. He lived in Israel for a period where he was involved in Israel's national emergency medical services.\n\n\"I want Trump to bring peace through strength. I want him to bring an end to the war-but by overwhelming force,\" he said. He blamed Joe Biden for \"handicapping the Israeli army.\" But he also said that Israel is not the biggest issue for him in the coming election. He is far more concerned with immigration and gun rights, he said.\n\nJacob continued to engage Black and Hispanic counterprotesters after we finished talking. I overheard him telling one, \"You support Hamas. You're a fucking terrorist.\"\n\nInside the rally, Trump tried to make the case that migrants arriving in New York had \"the biggest negative impact\" on \"our Black population and our Hispanic population, who are losing their jobs, losing their housing, losing everything they can lose.\" On cue, even in this Hispanic stronghold, he inspired audible cheers of \"Build the wall.\"\n\nAs the afternoon gave way to evening, more familiar scenes in the Bronx began to dominate the crowd outside the Trump rally. On my way out, I encountered a small group of Black and Hispanic kids who were between 11 and 13 years old. \"I don't even know what's going on,\" one said. They had come to the park looking to play some basketball and were surprised to see the massive crowd. \"This is animated, bro,\" they all said, talking over each other. \"It's hectic, bro. People charging $40 for a hat. Y'all are scammy.\"\n\nThough there was still a strong presence of Trump supporters in the park, they had begun to be outflanked by a loud minority of natives who hijacked the space for their amusement. \"We're just trying to have fun, get some bitches. We're smoking, we're chilling right now,\" said another group of young people. They saw Trump as a lot of Americans used to: as entertainment.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

Rebecca Onion is still out, and I, Gabriel Roth, am still here to highlight thought-provoking pieces from Slate and around the web.\n\nAfter months of refusing to attack Republican front-runner Donald Trump, Marco Rubio has finally come up with a line of criticism: He's racist . Unfortunately, as Will Saletan points out, GOP voters may not find racism sufficient grounds to reject Trump-so Rubio is framing his attack as an issue of electabilty . \"The problem, according to Rubio, isn't that this racist, if nominated, would win the election,\" Saletan writes. \"It's that he wouldn't.\"\n\nIsaac Chotiner thinks Super Tuesday proves that Rubio is toast, and subjects him to this withering post-mortem . Trump was the proximate cause of the Rubio collapse, Chotiner argues, \"but there were other festering problems, from his canned answers and overprogrammed style, to the unfortunate fact that he is a youngish, Hispanic man who speaks about his hopes and dreams for America to a Republican electorate that is white, old, and hopelessly depressed about an increasingly Hispanic America.\"\n\nBut the Republican establishment hasn't given up yet! As Jim Newell reports, GOP grandees have a plan to stop Trump -and it's a bank shot. \"The goal now is to deny Trump from reaching an outright majority of delegates and then oust him after the first ballot at the convention,\" Newell writes. \"This isn't just the backup plan anymore; it is the plan.\" The problem-besides the difficulty of staging a convention coup -is what happens next. \"Do the plotters believe that this will go over well with Trump supporters?\"\n\n\" Can You Guess Which of These Books Are Banned in Prison? \" I did poorly on this.\n\n\"The story of single women is the story of the country,\" writes Rebecca Traister in her new book, All the Single Ladies, which argues that unmarried women are the drivers of cultural change. In her Slate review of Traister's book, Nora Caplan-Bricker argues that \" the idea of female choice \" is \"an interconnected web of causes and effects that's remaking society for everyone .\"\n\nWhy does schizophrenia make people hear voices? They're actually hearing their own \" subvocal speech \"-the unconscious muttering that we all do, and that people with schizophrenia are unable to disregard. \"The brain is a master storyteller, designed to make sense of the chaos of our lives,\" neurologist Eliezer Sternberg writes. \"It compensates for the presence of auditory hallucinations, caused by a defect in self-recognition, by writing a narrative to account for them\"-such as the typical schizophrenic delusions of eavesdropping spies or demonic possession.\n\nFor fun, if your idea of fun is kind of depressing: \" Why Are You Lonely: A Text Game .\"\n\nConspiratorially,\n\nGabe\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "What Pundits Keep Getting Wrong About Donald Trump and the Working Class\n\nBrett Carlsen/Getty Images\n\nMost analysis of Donald Trump's electability hinges on his working-class appeal-specifically, working-class anger at the economic arrangements of a post-recession America. \"The deeper, long-term reasons for today's rage are not hard to find, although many of us elites have shamefully found ourselves able to ignore them,\" writes Andrew Sullivan , now of New York magazine, in an essay on Trump, his rise, and its threat to American democracy. \"The jobs available to the working class no longer contain the kind of craftsmanship or satisfaction or meaning that can take the sting out of their low and stagnant wages.\"\n\nBut something happens in this discussion of working-class anger. Sullivan, like others tackling the subject, moves from an analysis of the \"working class\" to an analysis of the \"white working class,\" gliding between the two as if they're synonymous. \"This is an age in which a woman might succeed a black man as president, but also one in which a member of the white working class has declining options to make a decent living,\" he writes. \"This is a time when gay people can be married in 50 states, even as working-class families are hanging by a thread.\"\n\nThis is a critical conflation. If the \"working class\" and the \"white working class\" are synonymous, then Trump is a genuine threat-a demagogue who can channel and ride mass frustration to the White House. And it bolsters Sullivan's (and others') subordinate point: that liberals bear a great deal of blame for Trump for having stigmatized working-class morals and attitudes and ignoring their anger and economic anxiety, thus alienating them from mainstream politics and leaving them ripe for a figure like Trump.\n\nExcept there's a problem. The American working class has changed. A lot.\n\nIn the collective mind's eye of political pundits and observers, the \"working class\" is what it was a generation ago: largely white and mostly male, with a heavy presence in trades and factories. There are still Americans who fit this description. But they're also a shrinking portion of the working class, and the attention they receive perennially from political observers-many of whom see them as the pivot around which American politics turns-is entirely out of proportion to their declining numbers.\n\nAs recently as 2013 , more than 60 percent of working-class Americans between 25 and 54 years old were white. If you extend the age bracket to 64, that increases to nearly 63 percent. But in 2014, those numbers-for the first category-dropped to 59.6 percent. In 2015, it was 58.8 percent. This year, non-Hispanic whites are 58 percent of the working class, a historic low.\n\nPeople of color make up more than a third of America's labor force, and they're a large and growing plurality of working-class people in particular. As of this year, 23.5 percent of working people are Hispanic; 15 percent are black; and 3.5 percent are Asian American. That's a total of 42 percent. In 10 years, they'll constitute nearly half of all working-class Americans. As it stands, the youngest cohort of working-class Americans-at 54.4 percent white and 45.5 percent nonwhite-is almost there. And close to half of all working-class people-across all races and ethnic groups-are women working in service jobs as well as traditional blue-collar professions.\n\nMuch of this \"new\" working class, including a substantial minority of its whites, leans Democratic; they backed Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 , and many support Hillary Clinton in this year's Democratic primary. They aren't alienated by movements for immigrant rights and police reform; they're sympathetic. They're not just the beneficiaries of the liberal push for greater inclusion; they're often the people driving it. These Americans, women in particular, are an integral part of the new liberal majority.\n\nTally the numbers and you'll find that Trump's appeal falls well outside the large plurality (if not majority) of working-class Americans who are either people of color (young or otherwise), or liberal to moderate whites. And you see this in polls of Trump's favorability. In terms of popularity with blacks , Hispanics , women , and young people , the real estate mogul's polling is somewhere in the Marianas Trench.\n\nThe truth is that it's inaccurate to talk about Trump's \"working-class appeal.\" What Trump has, instead, is a message tailored to a conservative portion of white workers. These voters aren't the struggling whites of Appalachia or the old Rust Belt, in part because those workers don't vote, and there's no evidence Trump has turned them out. Instead, Trump is winning those whites with middle-class incomes. Given his strength in unionized areas like the Northeast, some are blue collar and culturally working class. But many others are not. Many others are what we would simply call Republicans.\n\nEven if Trump had a broad working-class message, it's important to remember that people engage politics in different ways through different identities. A working-class black woman doesn't have to be sympathetic to unauthorized immigrants to see threat in Trump's rhetoric against outsiders; a working-class Hispanic man doesn't have to hold politically correct attitudes about Muslim Americans to fear a candidate who promises a ban on a whole category of people. Given their high religiosity, black voters at one point were supposed to turn against Democrats on same-sex marriage. But the issue wasn't salient for their politics-or at least, not salient in a contest between Republicans and Democrats. They remained in the fold.\n\nSullivan is right that the times call for vigilance. Against an unprecedented figure like Trump, complacency is dangerous. But we should also have clear eyes. Insofar that he represents any of it, Trump just speaks for a portion of working America, and the same divisions of race and religion that make broad working-class movements rare also limit the ability of a Trump figure to succeed. Why pundits can't see this-why so many consistently miss the degree to which America is browner and blacker than it's ever been-might have something to do with who they are. America's commentary class is largely white. America's voters, increasingly, are not.\n\nRead more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Inauguration Is More Than Two Months Away, and Senate Democrats Are Already Selling Out\n\nMark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump, as you may recall, is mulling over a policy that would ban Muslims from entering the United States and is considering tracking ones already here in a database . He has endorsed shutting down mosques and defamed thousands of Muslims in New Jersey-\"Arabs,\" he said-by claiming, repeatedly, that they had celebrated the deaths of 3,000 Americans on 9/11. He said that the Mexican undocumented population in the United States-11 million or so people in total, all of whom he has pledged to deport-is comprised of rapists, murderers, and \"some\" morally upstanding people of indeterminate number. He said this past March that as president, he would be able to force the United States military to torture prisoners and commit any war crimes he deemed justifiable and necessary. He is nuclear massacre-curious . He responded to reports that overzealous supporters of his had beaten and urinated on a homeless Hispanic man by saying that they had simply \"loved their country.\" He called for the execution of five black and Hispanic men found to be innocent of the crime for which they had been convicted. He is being sued for fraud . He has done business with the Mafia . He has been accused of sexual assault by around a dozen women .\n\nFor over a year, Democratic Party politicians and leaders have told the American people that for these and endless other reasons , Donald Trump could never be countenanced as the president of the United States. Now that he's won, it seems that many have changed their minds. Donald Trump, the New York Times reported last night, is someone Senate Democrats think they can work with:\n\nOn infrastructure spending, child tax credits, paid maternity leave and dismantling trade agreements, Democrats are looking for ways they can work with Mr. Trump and force Republican leaders to choose between their new president and their small-government, free-market principles. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, elected Wednesday as the new Democratic minority leader, has spoken with Mr. Trump several times, and Democrats, in coming weeks plan to announce populist economics and ethics initiatives they think Mr. Trump might like.\n\nA hundred years from now, some young soul wondering what became of the world is going to wade through some flooded coastal library, blow the dust off a decrepit computer terminal, and read, in wonder and amazement, about this thing, this creature of infinite stupidity-the \"Democrat\"-that thought it could outsmart a man who used so-called charity money to buy a 6-foot-tall painting of himself by getting him to commit to \"ethics initiatives.\"\n\nInfrastructure spending, child tax credits, and paid maternity leave-these are all good things. But their goodness isn't the point. The point is that Donald Trump has shown no signs whatsoever that we should anticipate a major break from Republican Party orthodoxy. His rumored Cabinet and transition team have been populated by a who's who of GOP stalwarts and \"fringe\" figures whose ideas the GOP has merrily spread to its voters. The man who said he could shoot a random passerby on Fifth Avenue without losing support is not, on the vast majority of issues save perhaps immigration and trade, going to feel an obligation to maintain the heterodox counter-GOP stances he took during the campaign in order to keep his voters. Donald Trump, who must know, at this point, just how in over his head he really is, is simply going to follow the path of ease and least resistance. On the majority of issues, he's going to do what the Republican Party tells him to do and perhaps the worst of what he promised voters he would do. And, as Jamelle Bouie wrote yesterday , the Democratic response, at every turn, should be resistance, not normalization:\n\nSupporting a Trump-branded infrastructure initiative as a discrete piece of policy where two sides can find common ground only bolsters a white-nationalist politics, even if you oppose the rest of Trump's agenda. It legitimizes and gives fuel to white tribalism as a political strategy. It shows that there are tangible gains for embracing Trump-style demagoguery. Likewise, it seems reasonable to want to recast support for Trump as an expression of populism. But Trump's is a racial populism-backed almost entirely by white Americans, across class lines-that revolves around demands to reinforce existing racial and status hierarchies. That's what it means to \"make America great again.\"\n\n\"Ethics initiatives.\" God help us.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Read Anthony Kennedy's Stirring Denunciation of Racially Biased Juries\n\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nOn Monday, in an impassioned opinion written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the Supreme Court expanded Sixth Amendment jurisprudence to create a constitutional safeguard against racist juries-much to the irritation of the court's three other conservatives, all of whom dissented. The 5-3 decision marks a landmark affirmation of the right to a truly impartial jury trial and bolsters the court's commitment to combating racism in the criminal justice system.\n\nThe case of Peña-Rodriguez v. Colorado began when Miguel Angel Peña-Rodriguez, a Hispanic man, was accused of sexual assault by two teenage girls. A jury convicted Peña-Rodriguez of this crime based exclusively on the girls' own testimony; no physical evidence linked him to the assault, and he claimed he had been misidentified. After trial, a conscientious juror came forward to inform Peña-Rodriguez that another juror, a former police officer, had tainted deliberations with blatant bias. The racist juror allegedly declared that , based on his professional experience, he knew that \"Mexican men\" have \"a sense of entitlement\" and a \"bravado\" that makes them think they can \"do whatever they want\" with women. In his own experience, \"nine times out of 10\" Mexican men were guilty of \"being aggressive toward women and young girls.\"\n\nPeña-Rodriguez asked the court to grant him a new trial. The court refused, citing a Colorado \"no-impeachment\" rule that prevents jurors from testifying about statements made during deliberations. Peña-Rodriguez ultimately appealed his case to the Supreme Court, arguing that the Sixth Amendment-which guarantees the right to trial \"by an impartial jury\"-must supersede the no-impeachment rule in instances of racial bias.\n\nGiven the plain text of the Sixth Amendment-\"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed\"-you might expect this case to be very easy. A jury tainted by racist comments cannot seriously be considered \"impartial,\" after all, so the Constitution would seem to safeguard Peña-Rodriguez's right to a new trial. But there is a wrinkle here: The no-impeachment rule has a historical pedigree that predates the Sixth Amendment. From the nation's founding, courts have forbidden, or strictly limited, jurors' ability to testify about deliberations following a verdict. These rules emerged out of a legitimate concern that jurors feel they can engage in robust and honest deliberations without having their verdict later called into question because of a stray comment made in the jury room.\n\nBut, as Kennedy explained, the 14 th Amendment-which extended the Sixth Amendment's protections against states-somewhat changed this calculus. The \"central purpose\" of the 14 th Amendment, Kennedy noted, \"was to eliminate racial discrimination emanating from official sources in the States.\" Indeed, the 14 th Amendment was designed, in part, to remedy \"racial discrimination in the jury system,\" which was rampant in the South. \"To take one example,\" Kennedy wrote, \"just in the years 1865 and 1866, all-white juries in Texas decided a total of 500 prosecutions of white defendants charged with killing African-Americans. All 500 were acquitted.\"\n\n\"It must become the heritage of our Nation,\" Kennedy insisted, \"to rise above racial classifications that are so inconsistent with our commitment to the equal dignity of all persons. This imperative to purge racial prejudice from the administration of justice was given new force and direction\" by the 14 th Amendment. Racial bias in jury deliberations presents \"a familiar and recurring evil that, if left unaddressed, would risk systemic injury to the administration of justice\":\n\nThis Court's decisions demonstrate that racial bias implicates unique historical, constitutional, and institutional concerns. An effort to address the most grave and serious statements of racial bias is not an effort to perfect the jury but to ensure that our legal system remains capable of coming ever closer to the promise of equal treatment under the law that is so central to a functioning democracy.\n\nThus, Kennedy concluded, the no-impeachment rule must give way when, \"after the jury is discharged, a juror comes forward with compelling evidence that another juror made clear and explicit statements indicating that racial animus was a significant motivating factor in his or her vote to convict.\"\n\nTo my mind, this decision is just common sense. The Sixth Amendment, read in conjunction with the 14 th , obviously prohibits racial discrimination by a jury. Really, the only question presented by Peña-Rodriguez was whether this discrimination is so egregiously unlawful that, when it is present, the Constitution must override the no-impeachment rule. The correct answer, in light of the 14 th Amendment's profound commitment to racial equality, is yes. Kennedy hammers this point home in his stirring peroration:\n\nThe Nation must continue to make strides to overcome race-based discrimination. The progress that has already been made underlies the Court's insistence that blatant racial prejudice is antithetical to the functioning of the jury system and must be confronted in egregious cases like this one despite the general bar of the no-impeachment rule. It is the mark of a maturing legal system that it seeks to understand and to implement the lessons of history. The Court now seeks to strengthen the broader principle that society can and must move forward by achieving the thoughtful, rational dialogue at the foundation of both the jury system and the free society that sustains our Constitution.\n\nThese are the words of an \"evolved\" Kennedy , a justice who has, in his later years, developed a clear-eyed pragmatism about racial discrimination that distinguishes him from his conservative brethren. It's disappointing that Chief Justice John Roberts did not join him in this eloquent rebuke to racism. While Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito remain willfully blind to race discrimination, Roberts has recently shown flickers of awareness , occasionally acknowledging blatant racial bias in our criminal justice system. Unfortunately, Peña-Rodriguez proved a bridge too far for Roberts, who still has more evolving to do before he joins Kennedy in vindicating the Constitution's clear command of equal dignity for all.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Lunch With Julián Castro\n\nJulián Castro, the mayor of San Antonio in Texas, is walking with me from his office to Acenar, a favourite Tex-Mex restaurant a few blocks away in the heart of the city's old Spanish mission. Every few ­seconds a motorist or passer-by waves good-naturedly to him. He's easy to spot: Castro, 36, cuts a striking figure, his matinee-idol good looks enhanced by a sharp suit, shiny dark shoes and an all-too-easy charm. He seems to be smiling all the time.\n\nHe has good reason to be happy. Castro, who was elected in May 2009, tells me that the mayor's role is more like being chairman of the board of the city council than its chief executive. But big city mayors in the US have a high profile. Over the past 10 years San Antonio has grown to be the seventh-largest city in the US. About two-thirds of its 1.3m population is Hispanic, making Castro's position the perfect springboard for a coming star of the Democratic party.\n\n\"Hey!\" A man with matted beard and ragged clothes loitering on the pavement yells to catch Castro's attention as we stride past. \"Ah,\" he says, eyeing the mayor's left hand as though he has just solved a puzzle. \"You got the ring.\" He gives us a knowing look and then insists he needs an appointment with mayor \"Julián\". (Castro pronounces his name the Spanish way - Hoo-Lee-An.) The mayor flashes a smile and walks on, waving over his shoulder and telling the man to get in touch with his office to set up a time.\n\nThe mayor's wedding ring (he and his wife Erica have a two-year-old daughter) is a tell-tale sign. It is what distinguishes him from his identical twin brother, Joaquín, who is unmarried but on a parallel political career track. Joaquín is a member of the Texas state house and is seeking a seat in Congress in next year's elections.\n\nThe Castro brothers are symbols of the rise of Hispanics in national politics. While the US has grappled with racial politics throughout its history, the vast Hispanic community is the latest battleground as the major parties seek an edge over their opponents in a deeply divided electorate.\n\nHispanics are by far the fastest-growing group in the US, responsible for more than half of the national population gain of 27.3m people in the decade to 2010 - and nearly 90 per cent of the growth in Texas. Hispanics will soon be the largest community in California and Texas, the two most populous states in the country.\n\nHispanic voters favour Democrats by a margin of about 60 to 40 per cent. This voting pattern could, in the 2012 elections , keep Barack Obama in office for a second term and could propel Castro, or someone like him, into the White House in future.\n\nJulián and Joaquín Castro were born in San Antonio in September 1974. Their mother, Rosie Castro, was then a well-known Chicana (Mexican-American) activist, one of the leaders of a group known as La Raza Unida , agitating for Hispanic rights and identity. She raised her sons largely as a single mother.\n\nThis life story might give rise to comparisons with Obama, who came to embody the political aspirations of his community and race. And, like Obama, the Castro brothers have Ivy League degrees, graduating together from Stanford (where Julián majored in communications and political science) and then Harvard Law School. Julián was so keen to get into local politics in San Antonio that he launched his campaign from his Harvard dorm so he could run for the city council straight after graduation, winning his seat in 2001. His brother entered the Texas state house in 2002.\n\nYet the Castros might be better compared to David and Ed Miliband, without, so far, the psycho-drama that the British brothers generated when they ran against each other to lead the Labour party in 2010. The Milibands, sons of a Marxist academic, have moved towards the political centre in their careers, just as the Castros have after their upbringing in grassroots politics.\n\nAs we arrive at the restaurant, Castro arches his eyebrows when I ask whether he has endorsed his brother in the forthcoming Democratic primary for the seat in Congress. \"Of course,\" he says. He describes his brother as his best friend. Castro's arrival doesn't turn heads among the staff. He comes here regularly and they are clearly used to his presence, leading us to a table in the centre of the restaurant without fanfare.\n\nAcenar bills itself as \"HotMex, CoolBar\". It sits astride the San Antonio River Walk, an old flood channel transformed into an attractive network of waterways lined with restaurants and attractions - \"the second-biggest tourist attraction in Texas,\" the mayor tells me with civic aplomb. The biggest tourist attraction in Texas is just five minutes further down the road. The site of the Alamo siege of 1836 is, for most visitors, a symbol of liberty, the place where a heroic band of fighters held out against an overwhelming force of Mexican troops for 13 days in a pivotal battle of the Texan revolution. For Mexicans, and some Mexican-Americans, however, it is a symbol of humiliation and defeat.\n\nThe restaurant's decor is shiny and new and the menu performs similar tricks, repackaging hardy Mexican fare with a touch of modernity. We are both in a no-frills mood, and order enchiladas de mole , chicken-filled tortillas with beans and rice on the side. Castro has iced tea, and I have a Pepsi, along with our glasses of iced water - always served automatically in American restaurants.\n\nThe iced water reminds him of his only trip to London, on holiday in December 2007. He says it was the \"little things\" that got to him there. \"Of course, driving on the wrong side of the road but also no ice - people don't have ice in their drinks.\" I suggest the climatic difference between sun-baked San Antonio and grey London might explain that cultural quirk.\n\nCastro has been tipped for success to the point where some in his home state are already sick of hearing about it. The Texas Tribune, an online magazine, noted in 2010 that his \"future electoral prospects are a frequent-bordering-on-yawn-worthy topic of conversation.\"\n\nCastro is not the first Hispanic politician from San Antonio to be marked for great things. Henry Cisneros rose from mayor of the city to become a cabinet member in the Clinton administration before his career ended in the late 1990s after a sex scandal. Nevertheless, I wonder if Castro's carrying of the expectations of his community is a great burden.\n\n\"Part of the blessing of being young is feeling that a lot less than one might think,\" he says. \"It is very flattering and I would be lying [if I said] that I never think about that. But there are certain challenges in politics that sober you up.\"\n\nThe first is that Texas is a \"very red [Republican] state\". Democrats have not won an election for any of the state's 29 elected offices since 1994. Castro says he aims to serve four two-year terms as mayor, which would take him to 2017.\n\nThat would set him up for a run at one of the most coveted positions in the country - Texas governor, a post currently held by Republican presidential hopeful Rick Perry and before him, George W Bush. It would be unthinkable for a Democrat to win that office now, let alone covet it as a step in an even loftier career path leading to Washington. But, by 2017, does he think the growth in the number of Hispanic voters may mean that even Texas could turn \"blue\", or Democratic? \"I think maybe by then it could be a purple state,\" he smiles. \"Not blue but a state that could elect either one.\"\n\nOne problem for a politician relying on the Hispanic vote is that their turnout is low on election days. Hispanics made up more than 16 per cent of the US population in 2010 (according to the Pew Research Center) but only 10 per cent of eligible voters, because of their relative youth and the fact that so many are in the US illegally. They make up only 7 per cent of actual voters. Although the community is now well-settled and made up largely of second- and third-generation migrants, it still lags in wealth and education.\n\nAbout 40 per cent of Hispanics in Texas don't graduate from high school. That already means, Castro says, that by 2040, \"the number of people with high school and bachelor degrees will be less than [it is] now, because of the growth of an under-educated community\".\n\nCastro struggles to explain why this is the case. \"There is tremendous love for family and children and aspiration to succeed but less of the know-how to shepherd kids through the education system,\" he says. \"Sometimes, there is a feeling that teachers know best and a shying away from parental involvement.\"\n\nOur food arrives. The waiter warns us to take care with the hot plates. I somehow don't process this instruction and nearly scald myself picking mine up. \"They mean it when they say hot,\" Castro says dryly.\n\nThe low Hispanic turnout is something that Castro reckons will change, if only because of the focus on the importance of their vote. As with African-Americans, he claims that conservatives intentionally create barriers for Hispanic voters at the ballot box, such as rules demanding IDs.\n\nYet Hispanic communities are social conservatives and highly religious. George W Bush famously courted them when he was Texas governor in the 1990s. \"That seems like aeons ago now,\" says Castro. \"The entire party has moved so far to the right.\" He recalls participating in a debate on immigration this year in New York when he says his opponents talked about Hispanic immigration \"as somehow lesser than previous waves of immigration\". ( Slate has a partnership with Intelligence Squared , which hosted this debate.) The proposition for debate - \"Don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses\" - underlined the sentiment that Hispanic immigration was not good for the US.\n\n\"It is not stated in such blunt terms but basically they were saying folks were inferior,\" he says. \"That argument is not commonly made out in the open but this is mainstream Republican talk and the Hispanic community picks up on that. Of course it is going to colour how they view conservatives,\" he adds with conviction. \"And it has and I believe that it should.\"\n\nHe admits he is conscious not to sound angry. Obama has exercised a similar discipline. It seems to be a rule of American politics that an angry black or Hispanic man does not play well with the broader electorate.\n\nCastro's mother was different in her youth. \"She was very active and, in keeping with the times, very vocal about the needs of the Hispanic community,\" he says. \"But these are different times. This generation sees things though a different lens. America has made a tremendous amount of progress in the last 40 years.\"\n\nHe says his mother, who is now 64 and works in a local community college, recognises America's ability to improve. \"She is at peace with the progress that has been made and is enjoying seeing it. She is not the fiery 23-year-old that she was.\"\n\nBut, I ask, is it true that, like many Mexican-Americans, she still doesn't like the Alamo?\n\n\"I am sure she still doesn't,\" he smiles. \"She grew up with a quite different experience from what my brother and I had. That has obviously impacted her world view about things like the Alamo. We got to grow up in a time when we were less burdened with that.\"\n\nSo you didn't grow up feeling angry and disenfranchised? \"No.\"\n\nCastro sounds firm, not angry, when he talks about the distant budget battles in Washington and Republican demands for cuts to health spending and pensions.\n\nThe debate, he says, is coming to a crescendo. \"I don't believe that America is at the point where people are unwilling to foot the bill for Medicare and social security, yet that is the ideology that is being rammed down people's throats.\"\n\nAs lunch winds up, he talks once more about his current job, and beats San Antonio's drum as a successful Hispanic city that has sailed through the downturn far better than the rest of the country. Like the rest of Texas, San Antonio did not suffer a housing crash and has benefited from high oil prices. \"This is not what people think; [they think] that if you had a large Hispanic community, it would be a poor town and that is not the case.\"\n\nWith that he grabs the bill and insists on paying. Given that the FT has very strict rules which mean the guest should never pay for lunch, I object strongly. To no avail. The deed is done. It is the only impolitic thing he has done all day.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Nixon Was the One\n\nThe Washington Post , New York Times , and Los Angeles Times lead with President-elect George W. Bush's last three Cabinet nominees, also the top story in the Wall Street Journal 's front-page news box. USA Today puts the nominees inside and goes instead with the Senate's ongoing discussions about Democrat/Republican power-sharing. The story explains the Senate Democrats' strategy: leverage their 17-day pre-Inauguration majority status and the attendant possibility of taking control of Cabinet confirmation hearings into parity with Republicans in committee memberships, staffs, and budgets.\n\nIn their headlines and top paragraphs, the leads emphasize that Bush, with his naming of current Secretary of Commerce Norman Mineta to be his secretary of transportation, has made good on his pledge to include a Democrat. The other two people named: just-defeated Michigan Sen. Spencer Abraham for secretary of energy and former Reagan administration Civil Rights Commission head Linda Chavez for secretary of labor. The NYT lead notes high up the slated Cabinet's reflection of Bush's \"inclination toward social conservatives.\" The WP lead calls the slated Cabinet \"strikingly diverse\" and quickly runs the numbers, observing, \"The six white men in Bush's Cabinet will be in the minority. Bush has nominated two black men, three white women, one Asian American man, a Hispanic man and a Hispanic woman.\" The NYT and WSJ do the same, with the latter claiming that the math is \"similar to President Clinton's first Cabinet.\" Later, in addressing Chavez's political leanings, the Times makes a Mendelian (if not Mengelian) leap in political quotafication when it notes that Chavez not only doesn't speak Spanish but \"her father's ancestors came from Spain; her mother is of English and Irish descent.\" (There is no discussion in any of the leads about whether Mineta speaks Japanese or Abraham speaks Arabic.)\n\nEverybody notes that Linda Chavez is an opponent of affirmative action, but when the WP and NYT leads quote AFL-CIO President John Sweeney describing Chavez as \"an avowed opponent of the most basic workers' rights,\" neither story identifies any Chavez positions that might have occasioned the remark.\n\nThe NYT and LAT leads mention that Abraham once advocated abolishing the Energy Department. The WSJ and WP run this inside. An NYT editorial mentions it, too, adding that Abraham's appointment is \"a further insult to environmentalists still reeling from Mr. Bush's selection last Friday of Gale Norton as interior secretary.\" With reference to Mineta, the NYT mentions only three others who had served in the Cabinets of Democrats and Republicans. Both the Times and the Post report that before accepting the nomination, Mineta informed both President Clinton and Al Gore that he'd been contacted about it.\n\nA separate LAT front-pager says that the Bush Cabinet \"will have more experience-both inside and outside of Washington-than those who advised any of his immediate predecessors.\" But the paper's editorial on the matter, which focuses on Abraham's dearth of energy-related knowledge, is headlined \"EXPERIENCE-CHALLENGED.\"\n\nThe WP lead reports that a Bush spokesman yesterday criticized the treaty creating a permanent international war crimes tribunal that President Clinton just signed, saying that it would not be sent to the Senate for ratification in its current form, and that the spokesman said the Bush administration would continue the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy regarding gays in the military. The LAT lead says that, in a brief press exchange after his Cabinet announcements, Bush promoted his tax cut plan and restated his intention to escalate exploration and development of U.S. oil and gas resources.\n\nThe WP runs an exclusive on its bottom front about Edmond Pope, the American ex-naval officer recently convicted in Russia for spying and then pardoned and sent home by Vladimir Putin. The paper reveals another reason for Pope's arrest and trial besides Putin's oft-cited interest in reminding Russians that the KGB's successor is still very powerful: At the time Pope was in Russia trying to procure information about a unique Russian torpedo design, the Squall, a Canadian spy operation was trying to buy some of the actual torpedoes from a former Russian republic. The paper says that the U.S. and Britain were \"junior partners\" in the operation (which fell through) and that Pope didn't know anything about it. The story oh-by-the-ways another detail in the middle paragraphs that may even be more relevant to what really happened: Although Pope was trying to get the torpedo information for his own business ventures, he \"was asked by officers in Navy intelligence and research to report on details he gleaned about the Squall and other Russian technologies,\" and in fact, was also doing some torpedo research in Russia under a U.S. government contract .\n\nUSAT and the LAT reefer their obits of My Favorite Martian star Ray Walston, dead at 86. But alongside its Walston item, the NYT obit page has the passing, at 102, of Dr. Arnold Hutschnecker, \"who for many years served as Richard Nixon's psychotherapist.\" The paper says Hutschnecker was \"the only mental health professional known to have treated a president.\" The obituary says that it was Hutschnecker's opinion that although Nixon \"didn't have a serious psychiatric diagnosis,\" he had \"a good portion of neurotic symptoms.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "In High Maintenance 's Season 4 Premiere, New Yorkers Self-Medicate the Pain of Trump's Victory\n\nIn the first episode of its new season, the gentle satire High Maintenance turns its all-seeing eye on the devastating day after Donald Trump's election, and demonstrates that, nope, it's not too soon to laugh about it. The fantastic anthology show, a gorgeous, best-in-class web series before it was picked up and expanded by HBO, is a compendium of New Yorkers linked by a genial weed dealer known only as \"the Guy\" (Ben Sinclair, who co-created the series with Katja Blichfeld). For a show about stoners, High Maintenance is clear-eyed. It coolly dissects Guy's hip, artsy Brooklyn clientele, lighting them beautifully while exposing all their pretensions, foibles, and charms on such a crushing day.\n\nLast season, the first in which episodes were 30 minutes long, began to explore the Guy's private life. In one, told from the perspective of a dog, the dog fell in love with Beth (Yael Stone), a woman the Guy began dating. In another, we learned that the Guy's ex, who still lived down the hall, had become a lesbian-a plot twist written before Sinclair and Blichfeld broke up and she came out . The new season begins with the Guy's dream (come back to it after you've watched Episode 5, it has Easter eggs), an uneasy sequence set at a hair salon, from which he wakes to a nightmare. He turns on his phones and discovers that something awful has happened.\n\nThe first time I watched the episode, titled \"Globo,\" I thought the bad news was a terrorist attack. In my mind, the election results are so connected to the middle of the night that the suggestion someone could wake up in the morning not already dreading its outcome threw me off. But though the episode scans well enough if the bad thing that happened was some kind of terrorist attack, it scans perfectly if the bad thing was Trump, even if he's never explicitly mentioned.\n\nAfter getting the news, the Guy heads out to help the borough of Brooklyn self-medicate its way through this particular trauma, giving Sinclair and Blichfeld an opportunity to show off their impeccable observational skills. There is hardly any conversation from the immediate aftermath of the election that is not showcased here, lightly teased for its ubiquity and shallowness. The Guy's first client is in histrionic tears about the \"phantasmagoria of despair\" that is the world. The Guy counters that it's actually pretty nice out there, a \"post-9/11 we're-all-in-this-together mood.\"\n\nAs the camera moves down the street, into a locker room, through a brunch spot, past a bar, we hear fragments of conversation: \"Comedy's gonna be so great the next few years\"; \"Post-Brexit, where in the world is safe and sane anymore?\"; \"The middle class and poor are fucked\"; \"Were German people being dramatic when Nazis came into power?\" A birthday gathering is deemed a disaster; tourists elect to visit the 9/11 museum despite the timing; a few people head out to protests. It has the feel of an eerie snow day, everyone unsettled but still behaving like the moneyed, bourgeois New Yorkers they are, talking over mussels, workouts, and whiskey shots, between tourists and business meetings. A woman, gossiping about the bad news, grimaces and dismissively tells a busboy, \"I didn't know they were truffle fries.\"\n\nAll of this is observed in passing, but a few characters feature in extended sequences: a formerly overweight man struggling with whether he can post pictures of his exercise regimen on social media on this day of all days; a woman and two men holed up in a swanky hotel room, their phones dead, who don't know what has happened; and a Hispanic man, the aforementioned busboy, who follows that shift up with one in a bar, and late at night, makes his way home on the subway. It's this last character, an immigrant and father, who gives the episode its lovely finish, another quintessentially New York experience: a communal moment on the subway, when instead of talking so much, instead of quibbling over our fears and anxieties, strangers lift each other's spirits just by being kind, a heartfelt ending to a sour day.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Republican Party is less white than ever. Thank Donald Trump.\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThis is how Donald Trump made inroads with voters of color ahead of the 2024 election.\n\nby Christian Paz\n\nIs Donald Trump on track to win a historic share of voters of color in November's presidential election?\n\nOn the surface, it's one of the most confounding questions of the Trump years in American politics. Trump - and the Republican Party in his thrall - has embraced anti-immigrant policies and proposals, peddled racist stereotypes, and demonized immigrants. So why does it look like he might win over and hold the support of greater numbers of nonwhite voters than the Republican Party of years past?\n\nIn poll after poll, he's hitting or exceeding the levels of support he received in 2020 from Latino and Hispanic voters. He's primed to make inroads among Asian American voters, whose Democratic loyalty has gradually been declining over the last few election cycles. And the numbers he's posting with Black voters suggest the largest racial realignment in an election since the signing of the Civil Rights Act in 1964.\n\nThere are a plethora of explanations for this shift, but first, some points of clarification. The pro-Trump shift is concentrated among Hispanic and Latino voters, though it has appeared to be spreading to parts of the Black and Asian American electorate.\n\nSecond, things have changed since Vice President Kamala Harris took over the Democratic ticket in late July. Polling confirms that Harris has posted significant improvements among nonwhite voters, young voters, Democrats, and suburban voters. In other words, Harris has managed to revive the party's standing with its base, suggesting that a part of Trump's gains were due to unique problems that Biden had with these groups of voters. Thus, it's not entirely clear to what extent this great racial realignment, as some have described the Trump-era phenomenon, will manifest itself in November.\n\nStill, Democrats aren't in the clear. That same polling suggests that, despite Harris's improvements, she is still underperforming both Biden's support at this point in the 2020 polls and the margins of victory Biden ended up winning on Election Day. These numbers, especially the results among Latino and Hispanic voters, should be worrisome to Democrats: Biden did rather poorly among Latino voters relative to other candidates from the current century, resulting in Trump posting numbers not seen by a Republican since George W. Bush ran for reelection in 2004, and Harris could perform even more poorly.\n\nWhy? Putting aside environmental factors and shifts in the American electorate that are happening independent of the candidates, there are a few theories to explain how Trump has uniquely weakened political polarization along the lines of race and ethnicity.\n\n1) Trump has successfully associated himself with a message of economic nostalgia, heightening nonwhite Americans' memories of the pre-Covid economy in contrast to the period of inflation we're now exiting.\n\n2) Trump and his campaign have also zeroed in specifically on outreach and messaging to nonwhite men as part of their larger focus on appealing to male voters.\n\n3) Trump and his party have taken advantage of a confluence of social factors, including messaging on immigration and cultural issues, to shore up support from conservative voters of color who have traditionally voted for Democrats or not voted at all.\n\nTrump's loudest message - the one that gets the most headlines - is his bombastic attacks on immigrants and his pledge to conduct mass deportations. His most successful appeal to voters, though, which he has held on to despite an improving economy under Biden, is economic. Trump claims to have presided over a time of broad and magnificent prosperity, arguing that there was a Trump economic renaissance before Biden bungled it.\n\nThat pitch doesn't comport with reality, but it may be resonating with voters who disproportionately prioritize economic concerns in casting their votes, particularly Latino and Asian American voters.\n\nPolling suggests that voters at large remember the Trump-era economy fondly and view Trump's policies more favorably than Biden's. Black and Latino voters in particular may have more negative memories about Biden and Democrats' economic stewardship because they experienced worse rates of inflation than white Americans and Asian Americans did during 2021 and 2022.\n\nThose memories came up constantly on a recent Black Voters for Trump voter outreach swing this September through predominantly Black neighborhoods in Philadelphia.\n\n\"We have got to get somebody in the White House that has been there, knows our economy, knows what a bad economy looks like, and will get us where we need to go,\" Signa Griffin, who described herself as a Black Trump supporter living in Philadelphia, told me.\n\nSharita White, another Black voter planning to support Trump, said not enough people want to admit how much better life was when Trump was president. \"They talk so bad about him, but they forgot what happened,\" she said. \"I don't know too much about politics, but the only thing I know, my income changed, and if I need that man to get in here to fix my income, I'm all down.\"\n\nPolling suggests Hispanic and Asian American voters are feeling economic concerns especially keenly, and Hispanic voters in particular seem primed for an economic pitch from Trump: More than half said they trusted Trump over Biden to \"make good decisions about economic policy,\" according to research conducted by the Pew Research Center this summer. It was the topic on which Trump had the biggest advantage.\n\nOf course, Trump has long inflated his economic record and conveniently ignores the economic devastation he presided over during the Covid-19 pandemic and recession. That deflection provides an additional point that further complicates the blame Biden has received on the economy. Presidents, in general, have limited ability to control the economy (or inflation) , given the independence of the Federal Reserve and how interconnected our economy is with the world at large. But sour perceptions still helped drag down Biden's approval rating and electoral support as a candidate.\n\nAnd it hasn't stopped Trump from making a big deal about the opportunities his administration secured for minority-owned small businesses - he talks about cutting regulations, providing emergency assistance during the pandemic, and keeping unemployment low.\n\nAll of this resonates with Hispanic and Asian American communities, James Zarsadiaz, a professor of history and researcher on conservatism at the University of San Francisco, told me. \"As [these entrepreneurs] feel the punch of inflation, fees, taxes to run a business in very expensive metro areas, the GOP is starting to look more attractive to them again because they're seen as the party on the side of the small-business owner, as opposed to the Democrats who are seen as the party of protecting workers.\"\n\nOnce again, things have changed since Harris became the nominee, and polls specifically focusing on economic sentiment have tracked an improving national mood and growing trust in Harris's ability to handle economic issues. But Trump is still benefiting from a sense of nostalgia and has tried his best to tie Harris to Biden's economic record, asking voters routinely if they are better off today than they were four years ago.\n\nThe political realignment of women voters has been one of the major stories of 2024; the gender gap in American politics exploded in 2016, took a break in 2020, and seems like it's about to be historic in 2024, with a huge pro-Democrat shift among women. At the same time, though, the rightward drift of men, including men of color, is a quiet undercurrent that may end up explaining what happened if Trump wins in November.\n\nPlenty of theories have been raised in the past about what kind of appeal Trump might have specifically to men and to men of color: Does his businessman persona resonate with upwardly mobile, financially aspirational men? Is there a \" macho \" appeal there for Hispanic men? Could his gritty, outsider, everyman posturing and brash rhetoric resonate with Black and Latino men, particularly those living in traditionally Democratic cities?\n\nAll of those could play a factor, but more significantly, pre-Harris, Trump's campaign and allies doubled down on reaching out to men , especially men of color , as part of an effort to exploit the growing gender gap and fuel disillusionment with Democrats.\n\nIt's the \"Jamal and Enrique\" strategy that the Trump campaign appears to believe in, that \"for every Karen we lose, we're going to win a Jamal and an Enrique,\" as Trump allies explained it to the Atlantic's Tim Alberta in July . That includes speaking to, campaigning with, and getting endorsements from TikTok stars , sports personalities , and popular Black and Latin musicians who have large young male audiences.\n\nIntentionally or otherwise, this strategy could exacerbate movement by traditionally Democratic constituencies that were already slipping. Among young Black , Asian American , and Latino men, loyalty to the Democratic Party has faded. Younger Latinos in general are more likely than older Latinos to identify as independents , and younger Latino men have tended to support Republican candidates at higher rates than young Latinas. An example: A Brookings analysis of the 2022 midterms found Latinos under the age of 30 \"supported Republican candidates for Congress (40%) at nearly double the rate of young Latinas (21%).\" And Pew Research has routinely found that younger Black men are more likely to identify as Republicans than older Black men .\n\nTrump and the GOP may also have found the right social issues to emphasize and campaign on in order to exploit some of the cultural divides between conservative and moderate nonwhite voters, and liberal white voters who also make up part of the Democratic base (in addition to liberal nonwhite voters). In 2021 and 2022, that looked like fearmongering on gender identity and crime, playing up concerns over affirmative action, and campaigning on the overturning of Roe v Wade.\n\nIn 2023 and 2024, the Trump focus has shifted strongly toward immigration, an issue that has divided the Democratic coalition as hostility toward immigration has grown. That's true even for Latino and Hispanic voters - long seen as being the voting group most amenable to a pro-immigrant, Democratic message - and it's being used as a wedge issue by Republicans among Black voters as well.\n\nThough it was seen as a gaffe, Trump's \"black jobs\" comment during the first presidential debate got to this tension - the idea of migrants taking jobs, resources, and opportunities from non-white citizens. Florida Republican Rep. Byron Donalds, one of Trump's go-to Black surrogates, explained the argument to me like this: \"If you're a Black man, Hispanic man, white man, you're working hard every day, and the money you earn doesn't go as far. That hurts your family, that hurts your kids. So they look at this situation, this immigration problem. People are saying, 'Wait a minute. Why are illegal aliens getting food, getting shelter, getting an education, while my family and my child is struggling. It's not right, and it's not fair.'\"\n\nAnd for Asian American voters, now the fastest growing ethnic segment of the electorate, immigration is also becoming a wedge issue, Zarsadiaz told me.\n\n\"This feeling, 'I've waited my turn, I waited my time' - there's long been Latino and Asian American immigrants who have felt this way. The assumption has long been that if you're an immigrant, you must be very liberal on immigration, and that's definitely not the case,\" Zarsadiaz said. \"Some of the staunchest critics of immigration, especially on amnesty or Dreamers, are immigrants themselves, and with Asian Americans that's an issue that has been drawing more voters to Trump and Trumpism - those immigrant voters who feel like they're being wronged.\"\n\nDemocrats are now moderating on immigration , but only after years of moving left. And that shift left has been true on a range of issues , contributing to another part of this theory of Trump's gains: that Democrats have pushed conservative or moderate nonwhite Americans away as they embraced beliefs more popular with white, college-educated, and suburban voters. The political scientist Ruy Teixeira and Republican pollster Patrick Ruffini have been theorizing for a while now that a disjuncture over social issues in general - and Trump's seizure of these issues - has complicated the idea that Democrats would benefit from greater numbers and rates of participation from nonwhite America. It may explain why conservative and moderate voters of color, who may have voted for Democrats in the past, are now realigning with the Republican Party.\n\nThese three theories try to describe how Trump specifically has been able to improve his and the GOP's standing among a growing segment of the American electorate. They place Trump as the central cause for the majority of this racial political shift. But would these dynamics still be happening if he weren't involved?\n\nThere are signs that some of this shift may be happening independently of Trump. It could be a product of the growing diversification of America, upward mobility and changing understandings of class, and growing educational divides.\n\nFor example, as rates of immigration change and the share of US-born Latino and Asian Americans grows, their partisan loyalties may continue to change. Those born closer to the immigrant experience may have had more of a willingness to back the party seen as more welcoming of immigrants, but as generations get further away from that experience, racial and ethnic identity may become less of a factor in the development of political thinking.\n\nConcepts of racial identity and memory are also changing - younger Black Americans, for example, have less of a tie to the Civil Rights era - potentially contributing to less strong political polarization among Black and Latino people in the US independently of any given candidate - and creating more persuadable voters in future elections.\n\nAt the same time, younger generations are increasingly identifying as independents or outside of the two-party paradigm - a change in loyalty that stands to hurt Democrats first, since Democrats tend to do better with younger voters.\n\nRegardless of whether Trump just happens to be the right kind of populist at the right time of racial and ethnic change in America or if he's a unique accelerator and contributor to the changes America is experiencing, November may offer more evidence that something has fundamentally changed in US politics. As America diversifies, it makes sense for its political parties to diversify too - and that poses a reckoning for Democrats in elections to come.\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby German Lopez\n\nThere's a tendency to make issues of discrimination into specific problems affecting only one minority group. It's black Americans who experience staggering racial disparities in the criminal justice system. It's Muslim Americans who are targeted in physical and verbal attacks by bigots who broadly apply the acts of a few religious radicals to the entire Muslim population. It's Hispanic Americans who are wrongly denigrated by racists as job-stealing, undocumented immigrants.\n\nBut history and research suggests that solving these issues of discrimination requires a greater understanding achieved through cooperation across racial and ethnic lines.\n\nJennifer Richeson and Shana Bernstein recently broke down this topic in the the American Prospect , noting historical examples of different minority groups coming together to combat racial and ethnic discrimination:\n\nMuch like the founding of the NAACP, however, the 20th century is full of examples of cross-group coalition building to enact change. For instance, the fight for voting rights in Selma forged by both the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference was supported by Latinos and Jews .\n\nBefore that , lawyers involved in Brown v. the Board of Education , including Thurgood Marshall - who would go on to be the first African-American U.S. Supreme Court justice - practiced their arguments in a 1946 school-segregation case brought by a group of Mexican American families in California in the case of Mendez v. Westminster .\n\nJapanese, black, and Jewish Americans filed friend-of-the-court briefs in both Brown and Mendez. Jewish Americans helped enable the creation and early sustenance of the Community Service Organization (CSO), one of the most significant mid-century civil rights groups for Latinos. In the 1960s and 1970s, Native Americans, African Americans, and Latinos joined forces in the Poor People's Campaign .\n\nRicheson and Bernstein cited a series of studies published in 2012 in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology that found Hispanic and Asian Americans were more likely to express closeness and common fate with another minority group if they were exposed to or experienced discrimination against their own group. Researchers primed Asian and Hispanic participants with examples of discrimination their groups faced. Participants exposed to discrimination reported having more in common and more positive attitudes toward black Americans than those who weren't.\n\nOnce participants could relate to the feelings of discrimination, it was easier for them to see why people of other minority groups were so troubled by it.\n\nThis doesn't mean that each minority group faces the same modes or levels of discrimination. But the studies and history suggest that multiracial coalitions can foster a broader sense of understanding to greater effect than standing alone.\n\nSome of that unity may be occurring organically. Among some activists and media, the February 10 police shooting of Antonio Zambrano-Montes , an unarmed Hispanic man in Pasco, Washington, has drawn comparisons to the August 9 police shooting of Michael Brown , an unarmed black man in Ferguson, Missouri, which led to the Black Lives Matter movement .\n\nFurther reading : Police shooting of Antonio Zambrano-Montes in Washington state could be the next Ferguson .\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe Bruen decision upended America's gun laws.

      "text": "Julián Castro is reportedly on the VP shortlist, along with Elizabeth Warren and Tim Kaine\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Matthew Yglesias\n\nHillary Clinton's choice for a running mate has entered a new and more intense phase, according to Julie Pace and Lisa Lerer of the AP , who say Elizabeth Warren, Tim Kaine, and Julián Castro have been asked for \"for reams of personal information\" and are scheduling interviews with Clinton's vetting team.\n\nThe case for and against Warren has been well-covered in the media, and Kaine seems like a safe, unremarkable pick. Castro is not ideologically controversial in the same way that Warren is, but would nonetheless be a choice with more upsides and downsides than Kaine. He's been marked as a rising star in Democratic Party circles for years, underscored by his selection as a keynote speaker at the 2012 Democratic Convention when he was a young, fairly obscure San Antonio mayor.\n\nWere Texas not such a rock-ribbed conservative state, the next logical move would have been a run for statewide office. Were his twin brother not already occupying the House district that contains his San Antonio base, a career in Congress could have been a fallback.\n\nBut neither of those were options, which left a Cabinet gig as his best chance to move up. And so when the post of Housing and Urban Development secretary opened and the Obama administration offered it to him he gladly accepted. The move to Washington only increased the buzz around Castro, and things like his speechwriter going to work for the Clinton campaign further intensify it.\n\nAnd Castro really does seem like he'd do the job of vice president - attack dog on the stump, glad-hander in office - very well. But the questions about Castro center on the \"maybe the president will die and then he'll be president\" aspects of the job rather than the day-to-day work of vice presidenting.\n\nJulián Castro's mother, Rosie Castro, was a Chicana activist in the city of San Antonio who was involved in the founding of the short-lived Raza Unida party. The party had support throughout the Mexican-American communities of the Southwestern United States and saw its greatest institutional success in the heavily Latino Rio Grande Valley areas of Texas before fizzing out amidst the general decline of radical politics in the late 1970s and growing Democratic Party courtship of the Hispanic vote.\n\nCastro and his twin brother Joaquin (who is now a Congress member) were born in 1974, and Julián has recounted that his mother's continued political activism was an enormous influence on his decision to enter politics.\n\nJulián and Joaquin both attended Stanford in the early 1990s, both graduated from Harvard Law School in 2000, both took jobs at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld after graduation, and left together to form their own law firm in 2005.\n\nThey also both made the relatively unusual decision to follow up their elite legal education by moving back to San Antonio rather than a bigger commercial center. In 2001, Julián won election to a city council seat, and the following year Joaquin won a seat in the state legislature. In 2009, Julián won election as mayor - a relatively weak office in a city with a council-manager system - and in 2012 Joaquin won a seat in Congress.\n\nSan Antonio is a heavily Latino, safely Democratic city located in the very conservative state of Texas. Both Castros chose to hew close to the national party mainstream, in ideological terms, rather than try to tack right to win statewide office. This left Julián's path to upward mobility after the mayorship unclear, and he accepted an offer to become HUD secretary in 2014.\n\nCastro would bring a lot of useful thematic and demographic balance to the Democratic ticket - a young Hispanic man to complement an older white woman.\n\nClinton, Castro, and Obama would in many ways form a perfect three-headed dragon to attack Donald Trump, represent the modern Democratic Party, and advance a policy agenda that's distinctly progressive without adding any ideological innovations that would alarm Trump-skeptical white college graduates.\n\nCastro also has a good eye for skating where the puck is going, politically speaking, and staying in the ideological mainstream of Democratic Party politics. This is a little boring, but it's very vice presidential and also reflects Clinton's own approach. His signature initiative as San Antonio's mayor was starting a preschool program, and under his leadership the city also launched a bicycle sharing system that, though wildly inappropriate to the city's actual urban form, put him in line with a fashionable cause in coastal urbanism.\n\nAt HUD he's focused on combatting racial discrimination and combatting smoking , two more initiatives that put him firmly in the center of the Democratic Party consensus.\n\nWell, he's the secretary of Housing and Urban development and the former mayor of San Antonio - and that's it.\n\nClinton does not particularly need to add gravitas or experience to her ticket, but she does need to be able to say with a straight face that her VP is well-qualified to take over in the Oval Office in the event of her death and incapacitation. Dan Quayle served four years in the US House of Representatives and eight years in the US Senate and was still considered a bit of a lightweight VP choice for George H. W. Bush.\n\nFormer HUD Secretary Jack Kemp was Bob Dole's VP pick in 1996, but Kemp had 18 years of experience in the House under his belt, during which time he emerged as a major factional leader. Castro isn't just young, his nose for the ideological sweet spot means he hasn't really distinguished himself in any particular way.\n\nLast but by no means least, Castro hasn't used his time in Washington to particularly wow anyone with his grasp of policy. Even though he's in a second-tier cabinet post, he's not an obscure figure. You could imagine a world in which journalists' Castro profiles were full of lines about how his resume's not great but if you talk to the guy for 30 minutes you'll come away so impressed with his intelligence and integrity that you hope his inexperience will be overlooked. It hasn't really happened so far, and he's arguably running out of time to make it happen.\n\nCastro also gets needled for his apparently poor command of the Spanish language, a reflection of the fact that his family's roots in San Antonio date back to 1920 . As someone who does not speak Spanish and whose family also immigrated to the United States from Latin America in the 1920s, I don't personally find this odd. But there is certainly a sense that a Spanish-speaker could be a more effective campaigner among Hispanic voters.\n\nVice presidents have often been selected with an eye toward complementing the existing strengths of the presidential candidate.\n\nClinton's resume is more extensive and impressive than that of any president since the founding generation, so in that sense she might be able to get away with a running mate whose resume is unusually thin. Barack Obama and George W. Bush had very thin resumes, so they picked older VPs with much more extensive experience. Clinton could be tempted by a younger VP with much less experience. And Castro's experience is concentrated in the one main area of American public policy - municipal government - where Clinton has never worked.\n\nHe's also a candidate who's mostly done things liberals like, but who the business community doesn't have any particular problem with - an asset as Clinton tries to assemble a landslide coalition rather than a minimum winning one. He's good at speeches, he's reasonably charismatic, and he could help Clinton build bridges with younger voters while pressing the attack against Trump on the stump.\n\nBut could he be president? By putting him forward, Clinton would be asking America to trust her judgment on a person who is not qualified by conventional standards. A sense that Sarah Palin - an actual governor of a state, albeit a small and weird one - wasn't up to the job seems to have hurt John McCain badly in 2008 .\n\nAnd Castro not only lacks experience at the highest levels of government, he lacks the kind of experience with national media appearances that would ensure he'll be able to put doubts about his experience to rest.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nBut it's coming.\n\nby Dylan Scott\n\nSteve Serrao, chief of gastroenterology at a hospital in Moreno Valley, California, just lived through the fourth wave of Covid-19 with the omicron variant sweeping across the country . Patients in respiratory distress once again filled the hospital's beds.\n\nBut it is another wave, one that's starting to trickle in but is still a long way from cresting, that Serrao worries about most. He fears that the delayed diagnoses of various cancers and other chronic, life-threatening illnesses - the result of Covid-19's disruption to routine checkups and screenings - will be the next crisis that overwhelms the US health system.\n\n\"Our next surge will be advanced chronic disease,\" Serrao told me over the phone. \"That's going to be the next surge of patients who overwhelm our system. I don't think our systems are ready.\"\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic dealt a crushing blow to the preventive services that can catch potential health problems before they become life-threatening. Screenings for several major cancers fell significantly during 2020, according to a study published in December 2021 in the journal Cancer . Colonoscopies dropped by nearly half compared to 2019, prostate biopsies by more than 25 percent. New diagnoses declined by 13 percent to 23 percent, depending on the cancer - not because there was less cancer in the world, but because less of it was being detected. The screening backlog was still growing by the end of 2020, according to this recent study, albeit at a slower rate.\n\n\"I think we are absolutely in uncharted territory,\" Brian Englum, a University of Maryland surgeon who co-authored the new Cancer study, told me. \"There are no examples I know of where we have seen numbers change this dramatically.\"\n\nThe fear among doctors is that the pandemic's disruption to cancer screenings and other preventive measures won't just be a blip, although a blip would be bad enough on its own: When cancer gets diagnosed late, it's less likely a patient's doctors can successfully intervene, and the patient is more likely to die. Even a four-week delay in treatment is associated with a 6 to 13 percent higher risk of death .\n\nBut they also fear that the missed screenings will lead to a more permanent disconnect between patients and the health system. Research has found that when patients lose their primary care doctor, they tend to end up in the hospital more , with more serious health problems. People who have skipped appointments or didn't get screenings or care may be less likely to seek it in the future, and the problems could compound.\n\nIt may take years for the consequences to become clear. Before the pandemic, some physicians questioned if the US might be conducting too many screenings. But the country is now being forced to undergo an unintended natural experiment in less screening, one with thousands of lives at stake. The collateral damage of a pandemic that has killed more than 900,000 Americans could grow even more.\n\n\"We could be years into this before we know there's a problem,\" Englum said, \"and we've already lost a lot of people.\"\n\nSerrao described one of his patients as a Hispanic man in his 40s. When he first noticed bleeding in early 2020, the patient talked to his primary care doctor, who told him it might be hemorrhoids, Serrao said. The primary care doctor acknowledged that getting a cancer screening would be impossible on short notice because the local hospitals were so strained with Covid-19. And the patient feared he might get sick if he went to a hospital.\n\nUltimately, it was 18 months before the patient sought a colonoscopy. He was diagnosed with what was, by then, advanced rectal cancer, Serrao said.\n\nIf the man had come in right away, Serrao said, he might have been cancer-free after a simple polyp removal. Instead, the doctor and his team are now battling cancer that has moved into other parts of the patient's body. His outlook is much worse than it would have been if the cancer had been caught sooner.\n\n\"How many of these cases are out there? Nobody knows,\" Serrao said.\n\nSerrao's patient had the misfortune to notice symptoms amid the biggest disruption of medical care in US history - one that hit cancer screenings particularly hard. In April 2020, as many hospitals canceled services in order to prepare for the expected surge of Covid-19 patients, the number of colonoscopies plummeted 93 percent. Then, after a brief rebound, the late 2020 winter wave stretched hospitals and forced them to limit services. By the end of the year, there had been 133,231 fewer colonoscopies performed in 2020 compared to the 2019 baseline, 62,793 fewer chest CT scans, and 49,334 fewer fecal blood tests.\n\n\"The drop-off in screenings has made me born again on the importance of screening,\" John Marshall, chief of oncology at Georgetown University Hospital, told me. \"We're seeing more advanced diagnoses, and people presenting at a stage where they no longer can be cured.\"\n\nIt will take months for the backlog to be cleared. Carrie Saia, the CEO of a community hospital in Holton, Kansas, told me that one of her facility's gastroenterologists had been recruited by a larger Kansas City hospital to \"scope from 7 in the morning to whenever at night, doing nothing but scopes.\"\n\n\"They're 1,000 people behind and backlogged right now,\" Saia said. \"A certain percentage out of those patients are going to have cancer growing.\"\n\nAnd working to clear that backlog begets a new backlog. Patients who are just now seeking a screening are finding it harder to get appointments. Marshall said he knew of patients who first experienced symptoms in September, were recommended for a screening by their doctor, but still couldn't get an appointment as of December because there are so many patients in need of colonoscopies, MRIs, and other screening procedures.\n\nCovid-19 led to direct rationing in overwhelmed hospitals last summer; they were unable to take patients with acute medical emergencies and couldn't find another facility to take them. But this more subtle kind of rationing - delaying necessary services for months because the backlog has grown so large - also takes its toll, forcing doctors to make hard choices about which patients to prioritize.\n\n\"Everything is harder,\" Marshall said. \"We've had to make trade-off and priority decisions about who's getting the treatment before the other person, decisions we would never have had to make.\"\n\nSerrao practices at the Riverside University Health System in Riverside County, about an hour and a half drive from downtown Los Angeles. Roughly two-thirds of his patients are Black, Hispanic, or Asian/Pacific Islander. Almost all of them have government insurance, either Medicare or Medicaid.\n\nBlack Americans already experience a higher incidence of and a higher mortality from colorectal cancers than white Americans. Black and Hispanic patients also tend to be diagnosed with more advanced lung cancers than their white peers, they have higher mortality from breast cancer, and they receive fewer prostate exams. At each stage, from preventive screenings to death rates, disparities already existed.\n\n\"They already have health disparities on a good day,\" Serrao told me. \"These last couple of years have put them back multiple years. The setback is quite profound.\"\n\nOver the course of the pandemic, Serrao's practice struggled to make a dent in the backlog. Just as they would gain some momentum, another surge of Covid-19 would interrupt their progress.\n\nLast January, the GI unit at his hospital was converted to a recovery area for patients receiving radiation therapy and other cancer treatments because overflow Covid-19 patients were in the space usually reserved for oncology recovery patients. As a result, he and his team couldn't perform any screenings.\n\nIt was a necessary step - the top priority was maintaining treatment for patients already diagnosed with cancer - but it required the postponement of screenings to identify new cancer cases. The backlog got bigger.\n\n\"I'm almost certain that there are population pockets out there that have high disparities with cancer that will show up in the next year, two years, three years with more advanced cancers,\" Serrao said, \"and that's because of the disruption in health care.\"\n\nThat problem may only be getting worse over time. Englum told me that one of the more troubling implications of their findings is that cancer screenings did not return to their pre-pandemic normal by the end of 2020.\n\nIt wasn't a two- or three-month blip during the worst of the outbreak. By the end of the year, the drop in screenings looked more and more like a permanent setback. It's the same problem we're seeing with routine vaccinations : people who missed their shots and aren't catching up even as we enter a new post-Covid normal.\n\n\"What our study shows is not only did we not make up for the blip, we didn't even get back to baseline by the end of 2020,\" Englum said. \"We kept losing ground.\"\n\nThe US health system struggled before the pandemic with managing people's care in a timely fashion. It requires having an established relationship with a primary care doctor - which fewer and fewer Americans do - and then staying on schedule with recommended preventive screenings like colonoscopies and mammograms. As of 2018, according to a federal study , only 8 percent of Americans were receiving all the preventive services that are recommended for them.\n\nAmericans have now lived through two years when their primary care practice might have been closed, permanently or temporarily. The hospitals where they would have gotten a colonoscopy were postponing those non-emergent procedures. Some of them may have been afraid to go to the doctor or hospital, knowing that a highly transmissible virus was on the loose.\n\nThat only makes the challenge of getting people to stay on top of their health care harder. Doctors worry that people's habits may be permanently changed by the pandemic - and not for the better.\n\n\"I am fearful that once people got out of that habit, they didn't see an immediate problem,\" Englum told me. \"Then they say, 'Well, I haven't seen my doctor for six months or a year and nothing happened. I feel fine.' They're just out of the habit. They lost the routine.\"\n\nThat means the health system is flying blind. Unless people get back in the habit of getting their recommended screenings, doctors will lose ground every year in identifying patients with serious conditions or at risk of developing them. That would limit their ability to get ahead of emerging health problems before they become chronic or even life-threatening.\n\nIn theory, Englum pointed out, this also could be an opportunity to learn whether the current screening guidelines are actually appropriate. If 10 years were to pass and there were no appreciable increase in cancer mortality, for example, maybe we could revise our recommendations for colonoscopies from every 10 years to every 12. The pandemic would have provided evidence such a delay doesn't present a big risk at the population level.\n\nThat kind of reevaluation is happening across the health system. Health insurers are monitoring the outcomes for patients who delayed kidney treatment because of Covid-19. They are watching for any negative effects, but also for countervailing evidence that might indicate the missed care was actually unnecessary.\n\nAt every level, the pandemic has forced a natural experiment in what a disruption to the usual treatment plan means for patient outcomes. We are going to learn a lot, like it or not. The risk is that those lessons will come at the cost of thousands of lives.\n\nBecause the flip side of the optimistic scenario is that in 10 years' time, we will see cancer mortality increasing as a result of delayed screenings.\n\n\"By then,\" Englum said, \"you've lost the opportunity to treat however many thousands of people.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nOur Covid mistakes did lasting damage.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Jeff Stein\n\nPHILADELPHIA - Niyah Harris knows the Democratic National Convention isn't for her. Not really, anyway.\n\nHarris, 24, is a concession worker at the Wells Fargo Arena. She's been on her feet almost continuously since 4 pm, and she's exhausted. The last few nights, her main responsibilities have been to gather the trash, grill the hot dogs, wipe off the condiment tables, ring up the customers, and steer lost attendees at the Democratic National Convention to their destinations.\n\n\"I'm tired, and I'm just ready to go home,\" Harris says around 10:30 pm, after I ask her whether she hopes to stick around for President Barack Obama's speech. \"And I've heard him speak before on TV, so it's whatever.\"\n\nConventions are elaborate logistical affairs, and they require hundreds of workers who are scrubbed from the coverage and left out of the TV highlight reels - these are the security guards, janitors, food vendors, cashiers, and dishwashers who make the political stagecraft possible.\n\nThey may not get VIP credentials or invites to the post-convention parties. But they arguably have even more riding on the president's words than the vaulted delegates inside.\n\nAs the clock ticked toward Obama's address, a horde of people streamed around Harris every which way, scattering up and around the stadium. Some stopped and asked for directions, often moving on before Harris had a chance to answer.\n\nA few Bernie Sanders holdouts walked by carrying \"Never $Hillary\" banners, still wearing face-paint. One posed for a photo in front of three reporters, tape covering her mouth. \"DOWN WITH OLIGARCHY,\" it said.\n\nAnother concession worker, Tim Smith, laughed. \"I have no idea what these people are doing,\" said Smith, 51, and a co-worker by his side cracks a smile.\n\nA few minutes pass, and Obama's voice begins to boom beyond the convention floor, reaching the outer-limits of the stadium's walls. Harris says she's changed her mind. She wants to know if we still have time to make it in to see the president.\n\nA clutch of concession workers, all decked out in matching black polo shirts and black pants, rushes through the hall in one direction. Harris and I duck around to Section 119.\n\nThe guard at the front notes that only I have a media pass, and that Harris's badge - \"VENDOR,\" it says - doesn't give her access to the floor. We ask a second time. He looks furtively around the corner, gives a slight nod, and waves us through.\n\nHarris smiles. We rush headlong toward a booming voice coming from inside the hall.\n\n\"We declared that health care in America is not a privilege for a few,\" it says.\n\nWe can't see over the crowd, but Harris whips out her smartphone. She points it up toward the big screen hanging from the ceiling of the convention hall, and begins filming a video of the president's speech, capturing a reflection of a reflection.\n\n\"A lot's happened over the years. And while this nation has been tested by war and recession and all manner of challenge - I stand before you again tonight, after almost two terms as your president, to tell you I am even more optimistic about the future of America.\"\n\nHarris tells me she remembers where she was, in her hometown in Philadelphia, when President Obama was sworn in. Her son had just turned 1. \"We had an inauguration party,\" she says. \"It went all night.\"\n\nI ask Harris if it's been important for her son to have an African-American role model. She shakes her head. \"No, I think what's important is that the president is a decent person,\" she says. \"There's decent and there's not decent, and President Obama is decent.\"\n\nPresident Obama begins to speak about criminal justice. \"I'm going through something personal with my son, and I feel like there should be a lot of changes with the judicial system,\" Harris says. \"He's right that there's a lot of laws that aren't fair.\"\n\nHarris looks back at the crowd. She says she's only seen security this tight at the stadium for a Taylor Swift concert. (There were snipers on the roof for that one, too, she says.)\n\nIt is beginning to feel like something of a music festival here in Section 119. Two hipsters to our left kiss. An old Hispanic man with an orange tie and a bushy mustache starts to cry. A middle-aged black woman is punctuating Obama's speech by muttering \"amen,\" not after Obama says anything in particular but every few seconds without fail.\n\nHarris, still straining her phone above the crowd, cranes her neck skyward.\n\n\"I think he really tried his best. He really did,\" Harris says of Obama. \"And now it's about to end. It's the end of the story.\"\n\nObama pivots. He's now talking about Hillary Clinton, and the stadium begins to really roar. A DNC official in a yellow shirt hands out signs that say \"Yes We Can.\"\n\nHarris grabs one. \"I think she's going to win,\" Harris says, posing for a photo.\n\nI walk out with Harris, who was told by her boss that she had to leave to clock out of work. She's both apologetic for leaving early but energetic. \"This has been a crazy couple of days, but my outlook on politics is different now,\" she says. \"I've had the opportunity to meet all of these different people, where beforehand I couldn't really give a shit about politics.\"\n\nHarris notes she's grown worried for her son that libraries and community centers are closing in her north Philly neighborhood, and she wonders if something can be done.\n\nShe laments that she often forgets to vote on Election Day. \"I always say the world is going to be a shitty place anyway,\" she says. \"But I'd like to start reading more about politics ... what if my son wants to get involved in it one day?\"\n\nWe're now walking toward the exit of the convention center, but we can still hear Obama's voice coming over the PA system. After three long days of working the convention, Harris admits to feeling drained.\n\nBut that's not why she can't wait to get home.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby German Lopez\n\nRust is a popular first-person survival video game where you start out completely naked, left to a barren environment to build yourself tools, weapons, and a home as other players try to do the same - and potentially try to kill you and steal your stuff. It's a tense game, one in which your friends can suddenly turn against you and basically ruin everything you worked for just for their own personal gain.\n\nBut it's not the betrayal and tension that has gamers upset with Rust . Instead, it's a new feature recently added to the game, which has 500,000 players each week, by developer Garry Newman: Your character's gender and race are now randomized. So even if you're a white man in real life, you now may be forced to play a black woman.\n\nMen, particularly white men, are not happy. Newman explained the situation in the Guardian, characterizing the reaction to the change as \"extreme\":\n\nFor race, this seems to be a regional thing. For example, most complaints about being black in the game have generally been from Russian players. With gender it seems to be more of a geography-free complaint.\n\nHere's one of the many messages we've received from disgruntled male players: \"Why won't you give the player base an option to choose their gender? I just want to play the game and have a connection to the character like most other games I play. Not have some political movement shoved down my throat because you make the connection we can't choose our gender in reality so let's make it like that in game too.\"\n\nIt's totally understandable that some people want to create their characters as they see fit. As someone who enjoys playing role-playing games, if I'm given the option I'll always create a character that I think looks cool. So I can, to some extent, sympathize with this sentiment.\n\nNewman, for his part, says that he just didn't want to spend development resources on a character building tool. And he also sees it as valuable that people are forced to be of a certain race and gender for their entire play-through: Players \"should be recognisable consistently and long-term - so anyone likely to commit a crime would be more likely to wear a balaclava or a face mask,\" Newman wrote.\n\nWhat's odd, instead, is that these same complaints from male, white gamers would very likely fall on deaf ears if they were made by another group - by, say, a black, Hispanic, or female gamer. After all, originally, everyone on Rust was forced to play a bald white man - and there was no similar uproar.\n\n\"I just want to play the game and have a connection to the character like most other games I play\"\n\nOr worse, such complaints would fall on actively aggressive ears. Consider Gamergate: The movement began in part as a response to journalists trying to encourage more diversity in the gaming industry - not just by opening the door to more women and minority developers, but also making sure that games reflected the potentially diverse audience playing them. This was widely perceived as such a vitriolic concept to a large group of gamers that they rose up and harassed the journalists and activists pushing for this increase in diversity, which Gamergaters said was an attempt to ruin games with political correctness (which doesn't exist ).\n\nGiven Gamergate, there's a bit of irony to the Rust controversy.\n\nTake this feedback Newman received from one male gamer: \"I just want to play the game and have a connection to the character like most other games I play.\" What this misses is that this male gamer is able to have a connection to the character he plays in most video games because he's a man . Meanwhile, minority and women gamers have for a long time just grown to accept that they're probably going to be stuck playing white male heroes if they pick up a mainstream triple-A game.\n\nNewman made this point in his piece for the Guardian:\n\nIt's maybe understandable why some male gamers wouldn't want to play as women. They're just not used to being forced to. You could probably count on your fingers the number of major, big-budget games where you have no choice but to play as a woman, never mind having no choice but to play as a black woman. Female gamers are obviously more forgiving - they've been playing games as men for most of their lives.\n\nIt's not that these gamers are wrong to be disappointed that they can no longer play as the character they would like in Rust . I agree that character customization is great. The issue is that many of the same people complaining now would probably be rolling their eyes if a Hispanic man or black woman asked why they aren't well-represented in Halo , Call of Duty , Metal Gear Solid , The Witcher , The Legend of Zelda , or almost any other triple-A title that's come out over the years.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nDJs, club owners, and patrons alike say there's way too much standing around.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nThe surprising truth about milk is hiding in plain sight.\n\n﻿From Dunkin' deodorant to Sabrina Carpenter perfume, smelling good isn't enough - it's all about smelling edible.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Genevieve Koski\n\nEven those who live far away from the bright lights of Broadway and pay little attention to the goings-on in musical theater have likely heard rumblings of Hamilton.\n\nThere's a reason for that: After a sold-out run off-Broadway that was extended three times, Hamilton quickly and loudly made the transition to Broadway, selling millions of dollars' worth of tickets months before it opened. Now, less than two months after its Broadway bow, it's one of New York's hottest (and most expensive) tickets. That's unlikely to change after 2016's Tonys, for which Hamilton is a sure bet to take home a few statues, if not all of them - possibly even the ones it's not nominated for.\n\nBut even those who don't live in New York, or aren't planning a trip there anytime soon, should pay attention to Hamilton. As far as mainstream musicals go, Hamilton is revolutionary (in multiple senses of the word), a fact that was clarified on Tuesday, September 29, when the show's creator and star, Lin-Manuel Miranda, was awarded a MacArthur \"genius grant,\" the annual $625,000 fellowship extended to \"talented individuals who have shown extraordinary originality and dedication in their creative pursuits.\"\n\nHamilton is not Miranda's first successful musical (more on that in a bit), but it is easily his best and most exciting. Here's a primer on what makes the show so audacious, why people are talking about it, and how you can experience it (sort of) from the comfort of your living room.\n\nMaybe a glimpse of the show itself will help clear it up:\n\nThat's right - as evidenced by the britches and velvet blazers, we're talking about Alexander Hamilton, the United States' first Treasury secretary and one of its Founding Fathers. Hamilton was also a key adviser to George Washington during and after the American Revolution, and he became one of the main interpreters of the Constitution through the Federalist Papers, of which he wrote a staggering 51 (out of 85 total).\n\nGod, no. It's 2015, and this is a Lin-Manuel Miranda joint, which means Hamilton is as far away as it gets from that seminal (but fairly musty) musical interpretation of our nation's birth.\n\nFor starters, Hamilton is often described as a \"hip-hop musical,\" though that doesn't quite get at the melange of musical styles evident in the production . But the music, which was all written by Miranda, is certainly rooted in the language of modern hip-hop, as well as in other traditionally black musical forms such as R&B and jazz, with a dash of Broadway traditionalism and Gilbert and Sullivan-style patter (which is basically just rapping anyway).\n\nOkay, granted, one of this nation's premier old white dudes may seem like an incongruous subject for such a modern-day musical treatment, but Hamilton doesn't merely justify the combination of subject and tone; it brings new shading and nuance to both. As Miranda himself has put it, Alexander Hamilton \"embodies hip-hop,\" which isn't nearly as glib a statement as it may seem.\n\nHamilton tracks the life of Alexander Hamilton from the time he arrived in the US as an immigrant from the Virgin Islands through his (spoiler alert for American history) death in a duel with Aaron Burr. Hamilton was a penniless orphan of illegitimate birth, and his outspoken (and oft-controversial) ascent through the nascent United States government is the sort of rags-to-riches story that not only makes for good drama, but also merges shockingly well with the energy and attitude of modern-day hip-hop culture.\n\nIn fact, Miranda originally conceived of Hamilton as a hip-hop concept album. Back in 2009, he performed a song from that in-progress work at the White House's \"evening of poetry, music, and spoken word\" for Barack and Michelle Obama, who clearly loved it.\n\nYup! It's the opening number, in fact, functioning as a sort of prologue setting the stage for the events to come. However, the song, \"Alexander Hamilton,\" has been fleshed out considerably in the transition from \"The Hamilton Mixtape\" to Hamilton, incorporating nearly the entire cast of characters, which also includes George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Marquis de Lafayette, and more.\n\nIt sure is! But one of the most interesting things about Hamilton is its approach to casting those old white dudes. As you may recall from that earlier photo, Hamilton 's cast is decidedly multicultural - in fact, the only actual white dude in the Broadway cast is Jonathan Groff (a Broadway superstar who also starred in HBO's Looking ), who plays King George at a narrative remove from the main action.\n\nThe choice to cast actors of color as historical white men (including Miranda himself as Hamilton) sounds like a pointed, potentially distracting choice, but only the former is true in this case. As Miranda told the New York Times , \"Our cast looks like America looks now, and that's certainly intentional. ... It's a way of pulling you into the story and allowing you to leave whatever cultural baggage you have about the founding fathers at the door.\"\n\nWhile that sounds potentially disrespectful to all the black men and women whose stories aren't taught in American history class, it really does work in the context of Hamilton. There's very little suspension of disbelief required to consider Miranda's Hamilton as a Hispanic man, or Thomas Jefferson (Daveed Diggs) as a black man, or Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton (Phillipa Soo) as an Asian-American woman, because the musical's book and lyrics so masterfully play up the revolutionary spirit and political uncertainty of the time that Hamilton really does feel like it's taking place in the modern day, rather than in the pages of a history book.\n\nThe play also, tellingly, plays up Hamilton and others as \"immigrants\" to this country, which feels like a pointed reminder that no one race or culture can really lay claim to America or its history. (And, in case you were wondering, yes, Hamilton' s content does touch lightly on slavery, but it's outside the context of race.)\n\nThe casting of actors of color is undeniably a bold choice, and one of Hamilton 's most talked-about aspects. It's also an interesting case study in so-called \"colorblind\" or \"nontraditional\" casting, which is forever a hot topic in all visual media, and in theater in particular lately: Recent imbroglios over \"whitewashed\" casting in high-profile productions of The War of the Roses and The Mikado have highlighted the need for greater diversity in stage casting, something Hamilton functions as a direct response to.\n\nBut for all that loaded context, when you're in the midst of the material, experiencing Hamilton itself, it feels utterly natural, less a political statement than a bold (and successful) artistic choice.\n\nThat's okay - neither can I, and neither can a lot of people. Luckily for us, the original Broadway cast recording of Hamilton was released in September, which means at least the audio portion of Hamilton is now available to all.\n\nWhat's more, Hamilton is what's known as a sung-through musical, which means there's little to no dialogue in the play that isn't part of a song. That means you can listen to the Hamilton OBCR and experience more or less the entire show from beginning to end (well, minus the visual element, but still). At nearly two and a half hours long, it constitutes a fairly major time investment, but 20 bucks and 143 minutes for the soundtrack is a lot more reasonable for the casual theater-goer than a trip to see Hamilton onstage.\n\nThere's also the possibility of waiting it out until Hamilton goes on tour or is remounted in a city near you. But that's not ideal for a couple of reasons. First, nothing of the sort has been announced or even hinted at yet, given that Hamilton is still a brand new show; you'll probably need to wait years to see it somewhere other than New York. Second, and more importantly, subsequent Hamilton productions will likely have a new cast, which means seeing the show without its star and driving force: Lin-Manuel Miranda.\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda has been a bright light on Broadway since 2008, when his musical In the Heights became a sensation. Having written the earliest drafts of In the Heights when he was a sophomore in college, Miranda officially became a Hot Young Talent when he took home the Best Musical and Best Original Score Tonys at the tender age of 28. (He was also nominated for Best Leading Actor in a Musical.)\n\nIn the Heights - which also features a book by Pulitzer winner Quiara Alegría Hudes - is an ensemble musical that takes place over the course of three days in modern-day Washington Heights, a traditionally Dominican-American New York neighborhood, with music heavily influenced by hip-hop and Latin music sounds. In the original production, Miranda starred as the narrator and main protagonist, Usnavi, and became inextricably linked to the musical's success.\n\nMiranda also played a major part in a couple of other memorable Tony moments, though as a behind-the-scenes player. Even those who pay little to no attention to the Tonys likely remember a moment from the 2011 ceremony that went viral the next day, when host Neil Patrick Harris ended the telecast with a \"rap-up\" of all the highlights from the show that was just ending. It was undoubtedly the highlight of the night.\n\nIncorporating multiple specific references to key events in the ceremony, the rap was clearly composed on the fly, during the ceremony - by none other than Lin-Manual Miranda, with his writing partner Tommy Kail. (Do yourself a favor and watch Miranda's video blog of them writing during the ceremony.) Two years later, they repeated the feat for the 2013 Tonys , and penned Harris's opening number as well.\n\nBetween In the Heights and the Tony raps, Miranda had clearly established himself as a wildly gifted and ambitious lyricist, but the extent of that ambition didn't become fully apparent until Hamilton. Inspired by a book he read while on break from In the Heights - Ron Chernow's Alexander Hamilton - Miranda actually thought to himself, \"What the world needs right now is a hip-hop-influenced retelling of the life of Alexander Hamilton, and I should be the one to write and perform it.\" The chutzpah and vision required to not only think up but also see through such a notion -at age 35, no less - is no small thing, and people are rightly taking notice, including the MacArthur Foundation.\n\nEven more so than with In the Heights, Miranda is Hamilton' s defining aspect - and not just because he wrote and stars in it. Miranda and his work represent an exciting and unexpected new course musical theater can chart in the future, one that's strongly informed by but not beholden to years of Broadway tradition.\n\nMiranda, and Hamilton, is clearly influenced by classic musicals - including 1776, for what it's worth - and storied composers like Stephen Sondheim. But there's also a strong vein of pop musicality that runs through his work. He straddles the line between the musical theater establishment and popular entertainment in a way few manage with as much style and substance.\n\nBut ultimately, there's something utterly singular and personal about Hamilton that rises above all that. There's a \"How did this even happen?\" wonder to experiencing this show, which unquestionably stems from Miranda's unique vision.\n\nThen you better get on it, and quick. Hamilton is currently playing at New York's Richard Rodgers Theatre and is booking through September 2016 (though it should run much, much longer). Tickets are already extremely limited, and range in price from $65 to $156.\n\nHowever, front-row seats for every performance have been set aside for a lottery, where those who enter get the chance to pay only $10 - get it? - for up to two tickets. You can only enter the day of, two and a half hours before the show starts, so it's a long shot.

      "text": "Ahmaud Arbery and the case for getting rid of citizen's arrests\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nAs the trial over the killing of Arbery continues, experts say it's time to rethink pro-vigilante laws across the country.\n\nby Fabiola Cineas\n\nNearly two years after Ahmaud Arbery , a 25-year-old Black man, was shot and killed in a suburban Georgia town while jogging, the three white suspects accused of the slaying - Greg McMichael, his son Travis McMichael, and their neighbor, William \"Roddie\" Bryan - are now on trial. They face charges on a total of nine counts, including malice murder, felony murder, aggravated assault, and false imprisonment.\n\nArbery's killing in February 2020 ignited national outrage. When a video Bryan recorded from his vehicle while following Arbery went viral online, viewers called it an unequivocal lynching . The graphic footage shows the McMichaels, both carrying guns, pursuing Arbery in a truck after he ran down their street in the mostly white Satilla Shores neighborhood near Brunswick. Following a short chase, the men corner Arbery, and a confrontation between Arbery and Travis McMichael ensues. During the struggle, Arbery is shot three times , twice in the chest, after which he slumps to the ground. It took 74 days after Arbery's death for the men to be arrested and charged.\n\nDefense attorneys will likely argue that the men's actions were protected by Georgia's citizen's arrest law, which at the time allowed a person to detain someone whom they believe just committed a crime. The attorneys may claim the men acted in self-defense while attempting to carry out a legitimate citizen's arrest of Arbery, whom they suspected of burglary.\n\nGeorgia's outdated and dangerous citizen's arrest law - one that was created in an era of slavery and emboldened citizens to act on their worst biases - has since been repealed . The law was replaced with a bill that limits who can detain citizens and when (business owners and workers who witness someone shoplifting or dining and dashing, for example.) But most states still have a version of these laws on the books, and as long as they endure, advocates say they could ultimately have tragic consequences.\n\nGeorgia's citizen's arrest statute had its origins in the Civil War era. Passed in 1863, when slavery was still considered legal by Southerners despite the Emancipation Proclamation , the law stated that a private person could \"arrest an offender if the offense is committed in his presence or within his immediate knowledge.\"\n\n\"It was a slave-catching law for slaves that attempted to flee,\" Joe Margulies, an attorney and professor of law and government at Cornell Law School, told Vox. \"It gave citizens the power to grab them. [The law] derives from a racist past.\"\n\nEvery state has some version of a citizen's arrest law, though they vary based on the type of crime and whether the citizen must witness the crime directly or just be aware that it happened. In many states, the laws are unclear about how long a citizen is permitted to detain someone, how much probable cause is necessary, and how much force can be used, said Ira P. Robbins, professor of law and justice at American University and the author of an article on citizen's arrest laws for the Cornell Journal of Law and Public Policy . Many of the laws also don't specify what it means to carry out a citizen's arrest or to detain someone while making one.\n\nThe laws, according to Robbins, date back to medieval England, where citizens helped the king maintain order by enforcing the laws. The common law doctrine of citizen's arrest was further developed in the early 19th century, and such statutes have remained on the books even as states laid out more modern systems of law enforcement.\n\nIn Alabama, for example, a private person can make a citizen's arrest \"where a felony has committed\" - even if they didn't witness it - and when they have \"reasonable cause to believe that the person arrested committed it.\" The law specifies that the arrest can be made \"on any day and at any time,\" outlines the steps that must be taken for a legal arrest, and gives citizens permission to break open doors or windows to capture the alleged offender.\n\nCalifornia allows citizen's arrests if the citizen witnesses a perpetrator committing a misdemeanor, or when a felony \"has been in fact committed, and he has reasonable cause for believing the person arrested to have committed it,\" according to the state's penal code .\n\nIn New York, a citizen can arrest another person if they believe the suspect committed a felony such as murder, first-degree manslaughter, or rape. It also lays out the circumstances where deadly physical force may be justified: when the citizen believes it is necessary to defend themselves or a third person against physical force in the course of the crime. (They may not if they know that they \"may avoid the necessity of so doing by retreating.\")\n\n\"I thought that the uproar over Arbery's murder would lead other states to revisit their statues, but there has not been much [movement],\" Margulies said. \"It certainly has not prompted a wholesale reexamination of citizen's arrest laws.\"\n\nArbery's killing isn't the first involving Georgia's citizen's arrest law. In 2019, Kenneth Herring, a 62-year-old Black man, was killed by Hannah Payne , a 21-year-old white woman, after he left the scene of a car crash because he was experiencing a diabetic emergency. Payne pursued Herring in her vehicle and ordered him out of his car. It's unclear what happened immediately after that, but Payne shot and killed him. She was indicted on charges of felony murder and malice murder , among others, and is still awaiting trial . Critics say she racially profiled Herring.\n\n\"Given what we know about implicit and explicit bias, allowing people to chase after someone and seize them based on what they believe was a felony is a recipe for some predictable number of cases just like this,\" Margulies said. \"With the automatic association between blackness and crime, seeing a Black man run by or drive away will lead to some predictable number of cases of folks concluding he's committing a felony. That's the real problem.\"\n\nIn 2012, neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, a mixed-race Hispanic man, fatally shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida after calling 911 and reporting \"a suspicious person\"; the police dispatcher instructed him not to approach Martin. Zimmerman, who was later acquitted of second-degree manslaughter, said he acted in self-defense .\n\n\"When you look at these cases, it's about people trying to protect an area - not protecting it from a crime, but protecting it from certain types of people,'' Rashawn Ray, a sociology professor at the University of Maryland and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told Vox.\n\nCitizen's arrest laws can also go wrong in other ways - as in 2014, when a man in Virginia burst into a lecture hall at George Mason University Law School carrying handcuffs, pepper spray, and a Taser-like device in order to execute a citizen's arrest of a professor whom he said had controlled his mind and sexually harassed him . In May 2020, a 22-year-old man in Arizona was shot and killed after he witnessed a hit-and-run and chased five people who ran from the scene in an attempt to detain them.\n\nBut in cases with a racial element, the laws are part of the pernicious way that \"place, space, and race\" intersect, Ray said.\n\nAlso factoring into the Arbery trial are Georgia's open carry law (which makes it legal to openly carry firearms in the state with the proper permits) and \"stand your ground\" law (which allows for the use of deadly force if a person reasonably believes it is necessary to prevent death or severe bodily injury).\n\n\"We will likely hear from the defense attorneys a series of dog whistles about protecting people in that particular community from people who look like Ahmaud Arbery,\" Ray said. \"With laws like the castle doctrine, people will probably believe that good Samaritans have a right to also defend their neighbors' property and that the McMichaels were coming to the defense of others. The defense will try to indicate to jurors that [a burglary] could have happened to them.\"\n\nThe trial judge will instruct the jury on the citizen's arrest law as it existed at the time of the killing, though Georgia has since repealed and replaced the law.\n\nThe protests surrounding Arbery's death - which preceded those for Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, arguably setting the stage for what was to come in the summer of 2020 - and the nearly two years that have elapsed since then have not inspired a large movement to rethink citizen's arrest laws.\n\nAfter the video of Arbery's killing went viral, South Carolina state Rep. Justin Bamberg introduced legislation to repeal the state's 1866 citizen's arrest law . Bamberg said on Twitter that the law was no longer necessary in America's police state .\n\nIn an effort to honor Arbery, New York lawmakers moved to revise the language in the state's citizen's arrest statute, calling the law a \"dangerous and historically abused practice\" that has been \"used by racists to advance their bigoted goals.\" The bill never advanced.\n\nNo matter the verdict, the Arbery trial could draw more attention to the anachronistic rules of citizen's arrest laws.\n\n\"All of these citizen's arrest cases with a racial element are on the same continuum,\" said Ray, of the University of Maryland and Brookings Institution. \"They end up in the exact same way. They end up with someone being killed.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nHow can you punish Trump officials for violating the law, when federal law enforcement is controlled by Trump?\n\nHow America's opioid crisis became a foreign policy issue.\n\nHow we design prisons and where we choose to build them says a lot about what we think of the people on the inside.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch's \"ghost guns\" opinion is extremely narrow, but it is correct.\n\nThe justices are likely to give gun companies a win, but they aren't sure how they will do it yet.\n\nRichard Glossip had everything going for him in his Supreme Court hearing.
