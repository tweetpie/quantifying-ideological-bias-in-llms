      "text": "Why Paul Gosar has become a 'sort of hero' to neo-Nazis and other extremists: report\n\nIn Arizona, far-right Rep. Paul Gosar is a polarizing figure even among fellow Republicans. Traditional McCain and Reagan conservatives have been highly critical of him, but MAGA Republicans who admire far-right figures like Kari Lake, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia) and Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Arizona) tend to be Gosar admirers as well.\n\nIn an article published by Talking Points Memo on May 30, journalist Haley Orion stresses that Gosar is so far to the right that some white nationalists and Neo-Nazis look up to him.\n\nOrion notes that in an earlier article, TPM reported that Wade Searle, Gosar's digital director, appeared to be \"involved with an interlinked group of social media profiles that were deeply enmeshed with white nationalist Nicholas Fuentes' viciously antisemitic Groyper movement.\"\n\nOrion explains , \"While the revelations in the story were significant, they weren't necessarily surprising. The Groypers are deeply hateful and grotesque, but Gosar has never been shy in his flirtation with various factions of the fascist far-right, including the Groypers' leader, Fuentes. Or, as Gosar himself has bragged in the past: 'I'm considered the most dangerous man in Congress.' A large swath of the far-right has, in turn, taken notice, with Gosar becoming a sort of hero in some corners.\"\n\nIn 2021, Gosar set off a major controversy when he posted a video that depicted violence against Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York). Gosar's defenders claimed she was overreaching, but his critics responding that depicting violence against a member of Congress is never acceptable.\n\nOrion stresses that Gosar isn't afraid to associate with extremists.\n\n\"Gosar has lent his support to a broad coalition of far-right bigots and Christian supremacists: from the s***posting Groyper neo-Nazis to the camo-clad LARPers and hate groups to the suit-wearing, ultranationalist political elites at home and abroad,\" Orion notes . \"He'll rile up the Arizona chapter of the Oath Keepers, telling them that the United States is already in a Civil War, 'we just haven't started shooting yet,' then repeat the same line in an interview with a well-documented neo-Nazi. He'll even associate with the conspiratorial, and often ridiculous, QAnon movement, tweeting out references to Q-drops - Gosar later said the tweet was sarcastic, though the tweet remains up to this day - and appearing at Q-friendly rallies.\"\n\nRead Talking Points Memo's entire report at this link ."

Andy Biggs (R-AZ) and Paul Gosar (R-AZ) have been subpoenaed by Arizona investigators to testify for a grand jury in connection to their efforts to overturn the 2020 election, Politico exclusively reports .\n\nPolitico notes as far-right Freedom Caucus chair at the time, Biggs, along \"with Gosar were among the most vocal congressional supporters of Trump's efforts to overturn Biden's victory in Arizona,\" and both GOP lawmakers sought \"to challenge the state's presidential electors on Jan. 6, 2021, when Congress met to certify the results of the Electoral College.\"\n\nThe news outlet adds, \"Gosar was mounting that challenge at the same moment a pro-Trump mob broke into the Capitol and halted proceedings.\"\n\nAlthough there's no proof Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes will bring criminal charges against the pair, \"the subpoenas themselves - in conjunction with a series of other aggressive recent moves - show that Mayes, a Democrat, has cast a far wider net in her probe than previously understood,\" Politico notes.\n\n\"Getting a subpoena to testify in front of a grand jury is kind of rare,\" American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona Legal Director Jared Keenan said. \"And that's why I think no one has challenged the secrecy law.\"\n\nSome of the Arizona lawmakers' attempt to overturn the election according to investigators, includes Gosar's ongoing \"relationships with activists organizing 'Stop the Steal' protests targeting Congress' Jan. 6 session.\"\n\nRegarding Biggs' actions, Politico reports, \"text messages obtained by the Jan. 6 committee\" show that \"Biggs quickly contacted Trump's White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, after Election Day 2020 to push for state legislatures to overrule the results in multiple states Biden won.\"\n\nAdditionally, \"Biggs also told Meadows that Trump should not concede the election and reportedly worked with other Arizona Republicans to advance the fake elector effort.\"\n\nP olitico's full report is available here ."

      "text": "How Paul Gosar emerged as a far-right favorite and subsequently the 'most dangerous man in Congress'\n\nOver the last two years, Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) has emerged as a heavy favorite among far-right conservatives. As an avid supporter of former President Donald Trump, Gosar has managed to gain more than 90 endorsements as the midterm election season approaches.\n\nDuring a recent rally, Gosar spoke before a crowd of right-wing supporters as he declared to be \"considered the most dangerous man in Congress.\"\n\n\"This is where it all began,\" Gosar said prior to Trump taking the stage. \"This is where we questioned: 'Was there fraud? Absolutely. Was it enough to overturn the election? Absolutely.'\"\n\nAt the same event, per The Guardian, the Republican lawmaker also echoed the stance of other right-wingers who have criticized critical race theory (CRT), the military and food shortages. Last but not least, he pivoted toward a Trump favorite: voter fraud and illegitimate elections.\n\nSo what makes Gosar different from other Trump-supporting Republicans?\n\nPer The Guardian, Gosar is \"the kind of politician that Trump - who is embarking on a series of rallies to try to cement his allies' power in the Republican party - is increasingly seeking to support.\"\n\n\"Gosar has extensive links to white nationalists and Capitol rioters and, many observers say, represents a dangerous new breed of Republican politician, who would have once been considered fringe, but whom Trump is increasingly making central to Republican party politics.\"\n\nJoe Lowndes, a political science professor at the University of Oregon who also co-authored the book \"Producers, Parasites, Patriots: Race and the New Right-Wing Politics of Precarity,\" weighed in on the rise of Gosar. \"We no longer have an ability to make a clear delineation between the right and far-right in the Republican party,\" said Lowndes.\n\nHe went on to explain how Gosar's rise underscores the problem within the Republican Party as Trump-like figures are taking center stage. The issue appears to be one that Republicans will be haunted by for quite some time.\n\n\"The Trumpist wing of the Republicans isn't just ascending - it's the dominant wing of the Republican party. It's the dominant wing not just in national politics, but in state and local politics as well,\" said Lowndes. \"The Republican Party has committed itself to a party of minoritarian rule, figuring out ways to rule in the long term without having majority support of voters.\""

      "text": "Paul Gosar just can't stay away from white nationalists: journalist\n\nAt times, Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona and members of his staff will try to downplay the far-right MAGA Republican's interactions with white nationalists and white supremacists. But journalist Caleb Ecarma, in an article published by Vanity Fair on April 7 , stresses that such interactions keep happening despite Gosar's occasional attempts to downplay them.\n\nThe most recent example, according to Ecarma, was an American Populist Union event scheduled for April 20 in Tempe, Arizona. Gosar was billed as a \"featured guest\" at the event, which, Ecarma notes, \"happens to coincide with Adolf Hitler's birthday.\"\n\n\"Shortly after the Arizona Mirror reported Gosar's billing at the event, which the House lawmaker had also promoted on his own Instagram account, the Republican's campaign consultant claimed full ignorance,\" Ecarma explains. \"Yes, this keeps happening.\"\n\nRory McShane, a campaign consultant for Gosar, told the Washington Post, \"I never approved this event and have never spoken to this group.\" And American Populist Union leader C.J. Trapeur told the Post that it is merely a coincidence that April 20 is Hitler's birthday.\n\nBut Ecarma notes that Gosar \"hasn't always tried to distance himself from his apparent ties to the far right.\" And that includes his association with Nick Fuentes, the white nationalist and Holocaust denier who founded the annual America First Political Action Conference (AFPAC).\n\nIn June 2021 , Ecarma recalls, Gosar \"appeared to defend Fuentes\" after a flyer \"surfaced showing\" that he \"was set to hold a fundraiser with the AFPAC founder.\" And Gosar claimed \"the left\" was overreacting to his association with Fuentes, who calls his followers Groypers.\n\nGosar tweeted, \"Not sure why anyone is freaking out. I'll say this: there are millions of Gen Z, Y and X conservatives. They believe in America. They will not agree 100% on every issue. No group does. We will not let the left dictate our strategy, alliances and efforts. Ignore the left.\"\n\nFuentes views AFPAC as a white nationalist alternative to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), and the MAGA Republicans who participated in AFPAC 2022 in late February included Gosar as well as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Idaho Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin and Arizona State Sen. Wendy Rogers . Gosar was also featured at AFPAC 2021.\n\nAnother controversy involving Gosar occurred in November 2021, when the MAGA congressman was censured by the Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives for posting an animated video that depicted him murdering Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York City."

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) - on Tuesday US Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) claimed that President Joe Biden wanted to have former President Donald Trump killed during the FBI's raid on the Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\nReferencing the statement, \"Law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force when necessary ....\" Gosar claimed via X/Twitter : \"Biden ordered the hit on Trump at Mar-a-Lago.\"\n\nAbout an hour prior to the Arizona congressman's claim, Rep. Greene baselessly claimed that \"Biden and the FBI planned to assassinate\" the former president.\n\nABC News Justice Department reporter Alex Mallon reported via X/Twitter , \"FBI issues rare statement directly responding to this attack from Trump and his allies. Says 'standard protocol' was followed - 'No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter.\"\n\nABC News contributor Sarah Isgur noted : Anytime the fbi takes an adversarial action like executing a search warrant, there is a deadly force policy. If there is danger to you or public and there's no alternatives, you are authorized to use deadly force. This is standard policy.\n\nShe added, \"And of course they gave the Secret Seevice and local law enforcement a heads up. Authorized to use deadly force is not the same as 'planning to shoot people.' But every briefing has to include a deadly force policy that is acknowledged by every agent before they go in.\"\n\nAdam Kinzinger replied : \"Gosar is a clown.\"\n\nLawyer Bradley P.

It's unethical and immoral.\"\n\nLawrence Hurley said : \"Based on Trump's arguments in his election interference case, Biden could not be prosecuted if he had actually ordered this...\"\n\nDoug Thompson replied : \"I try not to retweet nonsense but this is outrageous.Pre-authorization for use of deadly force is routine when issuing a search warrant.

      "text": "'Lousy job': GOP rep wonders if 'anybody heard a defense of Mike Johnson?'\n\nUS Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's (R-GA) failed effort to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) was supported by only two of her GOP colleagues - Reps. Thomas Massie (KY) and Paul Gosar (AZ).\n\nAfter both Republicans and Democrats smacked down Greene's effort Wednesday, Fox News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram shared words from Massie : \"Has anybody heard a defense of Mike Johnson, from our GOP colleagues? Has anybody said he's doing a great job? What I hear is, you know, he's doing a lousy job. We just don't agree with your timing.\"\n\nThe Kentucky lawmaker, according to Capitol Hill reporter Juliegrace Brufke, added that \"he thinks GOP colleagues who voted to table will get an 'a** whipping' from their base.\"\n\nFormer Speaker Kevin McCarthy - although slammed for his House leadership and ousted by his colleagues in September - was known for his superb fundraising skills. According to Republican members and donors, Johnson has so far lacked in that area.\n\nGOP donor Eric Levine told The Daily Beast earlier this week , \"McCarthy was a money machine. He just had a great talent for it.\n\nHe added, \"People like to donate money to winners. Now that he's demonstrated leadership, I think you'll see a shift. I don't think he'll ever get to the level-maybe he will-but I don't think he'll ever get to the level of McCarthy. But there's no shame in that. McCarthy was just in a class of his own in terms of raising money. But I think you'll start seeing a significant uptick.\"\n\nAhead of Greene's failure to oust the speaker, US Rep. Kelly Armstrong defended Johnson, (R-ND) telling CNN reporter Manu Raju, \"I probably have the longest personal relationship with Mike Johnson of anybody here. I served with him when I got here in Congress in 2018. If Mike Johnson is not thoughtful enough, and not conservative enough to be the Speaker of the House, they have real problems because there ain't anybody else that's going to be acceptable for that job.\"\n\nFollowing the House's rejection of Greene's motion, Pergram also tweeted Johnson's reaction, writing , \"I am glad this distraction will not inhibit that important work and all the other things on the table and on the agenda for us right now. Hopefully, this is the end of the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined the 118th Congress. It's regrettable and it's not who we are as Americans.\"\n\nThe GOP leader added, \"We're better than this. We need to get beyond it. The Speaker of the House serves the whole House, that's the job. But I am a lifelong, movement conservative Republican and I intend to continue to govern in accordance with those core principles.\"\n\nAdditionally, Pergram shared that former President Donald Trump responded via social media, writing, \"Trump on Truth Social on Greene's effort to oust Johnson. He asked GOPers to block Greene's gambit: 'It is my request that Republicans vote for 'THE MOTION TO TABLE.' We WILL WIN BIG - AND IT WILL BE SOON!\""

      "text": "'False narrative': Republican attack backfires as big-city Dem mayors make their case\n\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson attends a House Oversight and Accountability Committee hearing to examine the jurisdiction of \"sanctuary cities\" and its impact on federal immigration policy, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., March 5, 2025.\n\nWASHINGTON - Democratic mayors from four major cities Wednesday rejected House Republicans' accusations they have resisted President Donald Trump's plans for mass deportations by limiting cooperation with federal immigration officials.\n\nDemocratic mayors called by the GOP to a six-hour House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing were Brandon Johnson of Chicago; Mike Johnston of Denver ; Eric Adams of New York; and Michelle Wu of Boston.\n\nAll four cities have been subjected to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's initiative to bus migrants without legal status from the southern border to their locales without notice, overwhelming officials.\n\nThe hearing on \"sanctuary cities\" came as House Republicans gear up to move a bill that would strip federal funding for cities and local governments that do not cooperate with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\"The idea that these are sanctuary cities that need to be punished is simply a war on urban America,\" the top Democrat on the House committee, Gerry Connolly of Virginia, said.\n\nHalfway through the hearing, Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna said she would be referring all four mayors to the U.S. Department of Justice for criminal prosecution, insinuating they were illegally harboring immigrants without legal status.\n\nLuna said the referral for criminal charges is needed because she thinks the mayors are \"ideologically misled.\" A congressional referral for criminal charges does not require the Justice Department to initiate a prosecution.\n\n\"I'm not doing that in an effort to bully you guys, but I do believe that your policies are hurting the American people,\" Luna said.\n\nThe Department of Justice already filed a civil suit against the city of Chicago and state of Illinois in early February for its \"sanctuary laws\" that limit cooperation with immigration authorities. Those local laws do not bar federal immigration enforcement.\n\nDemocrats also pressed one of the mayors, Adams, about his lawyers' meetings with DOJ officials, and asked if he made a deal with the Trump administration to have his corruption case dismissed in exchange for greater cooperation in immigration enforcement.\n\nAdams dodged and rebuffed questions from Democrats on the matter and ignored questions as to whether he would step down as New York mayor.\n\n\"There's no deal, no quid pro quo, and I did nothing wrong,\" Adams said.\n\nThe hearing was the morning after Trump's joint address to Congress , where he vowed to carry out mass deportations of millions of people in the United States without permanent legal status.\n\nRepublicans grilled the mayors, singling out instances where the death or harm of a U.S. citizen was linked to a person without permanent legal status.\n\nColorado GOP Rep. Jeff Hurd pressed Denver's Johnston if he thought the city's sanctuary policy has \"made Denver more vulnerable to crime.\"\n\nJohnston said that \"even as 42,000 newcomers have arrived in the city over the last 18 months, crime has gone down.\"\n\nThe other mayors made similar remarks, and pushed back against GOP claims that immigrants increased crime rates in their cities. All the mayors said crime decreased in their cities even with newly arrived migrants.\n\n\"We are a safer city since I've been in office, (and) crime is down,\" Chicago's Johnson, who has been in office since 2023, said.\n\nSeveral GOP lawmakers, such as Gary Palmer of Alabama and Andy Biggs and Paul Gosar of Arizona, accused the mayors of thwarting federal law.\n\nEnforcing immigration law is the responsibility of the federal government, and state and local governments can assist, but cooperation with immigration enforcement is voluntary.\n\nGosar said that Boston's Wu was building a comprehensive immigration policy on \"false premises and false tenets.\"\n\n\"Respectfully, Congressman, you could pass bipartisan legislation, and that would be comprehensive immigration law,\" Wu said. \"False narrative is that 'immigrants in general are criminals' or 'immigrants in general cause all sorts of danger and harm.'\"\n\nSouth Carolina Republican Rep. Nancy Mace asked the mayors: \"Are you all willing to go to jail for violating federal law?\"\n\nMace then asked the mayors if they hate Trump more than they love their country, or whether they love immigrants without legal authorization more than their residents.\n\nDemocrats pushed back on the GOP bill, which would pull federal funding from cities that limit cooperation with ICE.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Danny Davis of Illinois argued the measure is an overreach of federal authority.\n\n\"The bill as drafted infringes on the Constitution (and) balance of power between states and the federal government,\" he said, adding it seems like the bill \"will cause more harm than help if enacted.\"\n\nMissouri Republican Rep. Eric Burlison said the legislation was needed in order \"to force these cities into compliance,\" through Congress' power of the purse.\n\nThe chair of the Oversight Committee, Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, asked all the mayors if their cities could be called sanctuary cities.\n\nThe mayors said their cities had policies of welcoming all people, regardless of status, but said they still coordinated with ICE if there was a criminal warrant issued for someone without legal status.\n\n\"I can tell you, in the city, whenever someone commits a crime, whenever there's a criminal warrant, we hold them accountable,\" Wu said. \"If ICE deems that they are dangerous enough to hold, obtain a criminal warrant, and the Boston police will enforce it.\"\n\nGeorgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene asked if the mayors would get rid of their sanctuary city policies.\n\nThe mayors defended their policies and argued that they were successful in managing their cities.\n\nDenver's Johnston was grilled by several Republicans about a recent incident in which a migrant was released whom Denver law enforcement flagged for ICE officials to arrest.\n\nOhio Rep. Jim Jordan asked why an ICE detainer, which is a hold in immigration detention for up to 48 hours, was not placed. The lack of a detainer resulted in six ICE officials trying to arrest a man in the parking lot and one agent was injured.\n\nJohnston said that Denver has placed 1,226 ICE detainers and this is the first time an incident has occurred. He said he is meeting with ICE officials to investigate the incident.\n\n\"If we need to make adjustments on how we do releases, we'll do that,\" Johnston said.\n\nPennsylvania Democratic Rep. Summer Lee argued it's not realistic for local governments to frequently use ICE detainers, because it leaves \"mayors on the hook\" for lawsuits on the grounds of 4th Amendment violations by detaining someone without probable cause.\n\nUsually a judge must issue an order to keep someone detained, and ICE detainers circumvent that requirement in order to give immigration officials more time to pick up someone in custody.\n\nA class action lawsuit resulted in changes to ICE's detainer policy that emphasize that local authorities can't keep an individual detained strictly for ICE's purpose, unless there is a neutral process, usually meaning a judge is involved.\n\n\"Republicans are putting these mayors between a rock (and a) hard place and the reason that they're doing this is that Trump is trying to get them to do illegal things,\" Lee said. \"If they work for ICE, they risk violating their own residents' constitutional rights and opening themselves up to costly litigation, but if they don't do Trump's bidding, they're being threatened with losing federal funding.\"\n\nDemocrats tried to highlight the economic benefits of immigration.\n\nWashington state Democratic Rep. Emily Randall said her state is home to more than 1 million immigrants and they are part of various job markets from agriculture to health care.\n\n\"We've heard from beet farmers and wheat growers and florists, Christmas tree farms, grocers and salal harvesters, that their businesses cannot continue without the support of immigrants,\" she said.\n\nShe asked the witness tapped by Democrats, David Bier, the director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, about the economic contributions made by immigrants.\n\nRandall specifically asked what the economic impact would be of the president's mass deportation plans.\n\n\"It would be devastating,\" Bier said. \"You're looking at an instant recession.\"\n\nHe said if the roughly 13 million people in the country without legal status were to leave, it would drop the U.S. gross domestic product by 7%.\n\n\"That's well into the trillions of dollars in lost production of goods and services that benefit Americans,\" Bier said.\n\nLast updated 6:18 p.m., Mar. 5, 2025\n\nIowa Capital Dispatch is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

      "text": "'Grow up': Top House Republican blasts his far-right colleagues over 'lack of respect'\n\nRep. Tom Cole (R-Oklahoma) has been in the House of Representatives for more than 20 years. In a recent interview with Politico , he unleashed on newer members of the House Republican Conference over behavior he views as counterproductive.\n\nCole was particularly candid about his feelings for the House majority's far-right fringe. He lamented that a small handful of extremists among his conference has so far been able to oust a sitting House speaker and assert their will over the rest of the party despite not holding any leadership positions.\n\nThe Oklahoma Republican, who chairs the House Rules Committee, specifically referred to the hijacking of the rules process - in which the majority shapes legislation in a way that gives it the best chance of passage before it's actually brought to the floor - as a primary concern. He noted that while members of the majority voting down rules to make a political point was done sparingly when Reps. John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) were speaker, \"we just finally saw the dam break\" after former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-California) was forced out.\n\n\"I would argue it's a lack of respect for the institution and the wisdom of the institution. These things have evolved over not decades, but centuries. This is a 234-year-old institution,\" Cole said. \"So it's, you know, you've got to grow up.\"\n\nCole was especially sore about the eight Republicans who sided with all Democrats to oust McCarthy last fall. He noted that even though the motion to vacate McCarthy came about after he worked with Democrats to keep the U.S. current on its debt service obligations, House Democrats were eager to use the opportunity to strip McCarthy of the speaker's gavel.\n\n\"I think it's on both sides of the aisle. They see the turmoil. I think Democrats kind of enjoyed it in McCarthy's case because they weren't particularly fond of him. He was our most effective political player, largest fundraiser, best candidate recruiter, best strategist, so I get why they wanted to take our Tom Brady off the field,\" Cole said. \"He kept the government open on a Saturday, and he was fired on Tuesday.\"\n\nCurrently, House rules allow for just one member to bring a motion to vacate a sitting speaker to the floor. Cole told Politico he thought that threshold should be raised in order to avoid the chaos that engulfed the House of Representatives for nearly a month in 2023 while the majority bickered among itself about who should become the next speaker.\n\n\"Frankly, I think you should have a majority of your own caucus that wants to do this. We had eight people that put ourselves at the mercy of the Democratic minority leader - and there wasn't any mercy in that case,\" Cole said. \"And quite frankly, they had no alternative candidate. They had no exit strategy. It was just, 'I'm mad and I have the ability to do it.'\"\n\nCole noted that while \"every caucus can have a few of those members,\" Republicans' narrow majority empowers the most extreme portion of the GOP as every member's vote is critical to pass legislation.\n\n\"You should never be in such a weak position structurally, process-wise, rules-wise, that a group that small can do something as significant as bringing down a speaker,\" he said.\n\nMcCarthy may not be the only Republican speaker to be brought down by his own party in the 118th Congress. On Friday, Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Arizona) announced that he would back Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's (R-Georgia) motion to vacate House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana). Gosar's announcement comes on the heels of Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Kentucky) joining the motion, meaning Johnson could lose his job if all Democrats vote with Gosar, Greene and Massie to remove Johnson from his position."

(AP Graphic)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - The House voted Wednesday to censure Republican Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona for posting an animated video that depicted him killing Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a sword, an extraordinary rebuke that highlighted the political strains testing Washington and the country.\n\nCalling the video a clear threat to a lawmaker's life, Democrats argued Gosar's conduct would not be tolerated in any other workplace - and shouldn't be in Congress.\n\nThe vote to censure Gosar and also remove him from his House committee assignments was approved by a vote of 223-207, almost entirely along party lines, with Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois the only Republicans voting in favor.\n\nGosar had deleted the tweet days ago amid the criticism, but he retweeted the video late Wednesday shortly after the vote.\n\nHe showed no emotion as he stood in the well of the House after the vote, flanked by roughly a dozen Republicans as Speaker Nancy Pelosi read the censure resolution and announced his penalty. He shook hands, hugged and patted other members of the GOP conference on the back before leaving the chamber.\n\nRepublican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called the censure an \"abuse of power\" by Democrats to distract from national problems. He said of the censure, a \"new standard will continue to be applied in the future,\" a signal of potential ramifications for Democratic members should Republicans retake a majority.\n\nBut Democrats said there was nothing political about it.\n\n\"These actions demand a response. We cannot have members joking about murdering each other,\" said Pelosi. \"This is both an endangerment of our elected officials and an insult to the institution.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez herself said in an impassioned speech, \"When we incite violence with depictions against our colleagues, that trickles down to violence in this country. And that is where we must draw the line.\"\n\nUnrepentant during tense floor debate, Gosar rejected what he called the \"mischaracterization\" that the cartoon was \"dangerous or threatening. It was not.\"\n\n\"I do not espouse violence toward anyone. I never have. It was not my purpose to make anyone upset,\" Gosar said.\n\nHe compared himself to Alexander Hamilton, the nation's first Treasury secretary, celebrated in recent years in a Broadway musical, whose censure vote in Congress was defeated: \"If I must join Alexander Hamilton, the first person attempted to be censured by this House, so be it, it is done.\"\n\nThe decision to censure Gosar, one of the strongest punishments the House can dole out, was just the fourth in nearly 40 years - and just the latest example of the raw tensions that have roiled Congress since the 2020 election and the violent Capitol insurrection that followed.\n\nDemocrats spoke not only of the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection, but also the violent attacks that have escalated on both parties, including the 2017 shooting of Republican lawmakers practicing for a congressional baseball game and the 2011 shooting of former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords as she met with constituents at an event outside a Tucson grocery store.\n\nRepublicans largely dismissed Gosar's video as nothing more than a cartoon, a routine form of political expression and hardly the most important issue facing Congress.\n\nYet threats against lawmakers are higher than ever, the chief of the U.S. Capitol Police told the Associated Press in an interview earlier this year.\n\nThe censure of Gosar was born out of Democratic frustration. Over the past week, as outrage over the video grew, House GOP leaders declined to publicly rebuke Gosar, who has a lengthy history of incendiary remarks. Instead, they largely ignored his actions and urged their members to vote against the resolution censuring him.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz of Florida said, \"I would just suggest we have better things to do on the floor of the House of Representatives than be the hall monitors for Twitter.\"\n\nThe resolution will remove Gosar from two committees: Natural Resources and the Oversight and Reform panel, on which Ocasio-Cortez also serves, limiting his ability to shape legislation and deliver for constituents. It states that depictions of violence can foment actual violence and jeopardize the safety of elected officials, citing the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol as an example.\n\nGosar is the 24th House member to be censured. Though it carries no practical effect, except to provide a historic footnote that marks a lawmaker's career, it is the strongest punishment the House can issue short of expulsion, which requires a two-thirds vote.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Charles Rangel, the former chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, was the last to receive the rebuke in 2010 for financial misconduct.\n\nIt would also be second time this year the House has initiated the removal of a GOP lawmaker from an assigned committee, the first being Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.\n\nGosar, a six-term congressman, posted the video over a week ago with a note saying, \"Any anime fans out there?\" The roughly 90-second video was an altered version of a Japanese anime clip, interspersed with shots of Border Patrol officers and migrants at the southern U.S. border.\n\nDuring one roughly 10-second section, animated characters whose faces had been replaced with Gosar, Greene and Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., were shown fighting other animated characters. Gosar's character is seen striking another one made to look like Ocasio-Cortez in the neck with a sword. The video also shows him attacking President Joe Biden.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., whose receipt of repeated death threats has required her to spend thousands on security, said Gosar has not apologized to her. She singled out McCarthy for not condemning Gosar.\n\n\"What is so hard about saying this is wrong?\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"This is not about me. This is not about Representative Gosar. But this is about what we are willing to accept.\"\n\nThis is not the first brush with controversy for Gosar, who was first elected in 2010's tea party wave. He has been repeatedly criticized by his own siblings, six of whom appeared in campaign ads supporting his Democratic opponent in 2018.\n\nEarlier this year Gosar looked to form an America First Caucus with other hardline Republican House members that aimed to promote \"Anglo-Saxon political traditions\" while warning that mass immigration was putting the \"unique identity\" of the U.S. at risk. He's made appearances at fringe right-wing events, including a gathering in Florida last February hosted by Nick Fuentes, an internet personality who has promoted white supremacist beliefs.\n\nHe has also portrayed a woman shot by Capitol police during the attack on the Capitol as a martyr, claiming she was \"executed.\" And he falsely suggested that a 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, was instigated by \"the left\" and backed by billionaire George Soros, a major funder of liberal causes who has become the focus of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Alan Fram and Farnoush Amiri contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Paul Gosar of Arizona for tweeting an animated video that depicted him striking Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., with a sword.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers said Gosar's actions amounted to threating another member's life, calling the video \"so beyond the pale.\" Republicans warned Democrats to be careful about dictating the punishment of those who serve in the minority because of the precedent it will set. Earlier this year, the House stripped Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., of her committee assignments for spreading hateful and violent conspiracy theories.\n\n\"This is a dark and dangerous road the majority is going down,\" said Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, the ranking Republican on the House Rules Committee. \"I urge you for the future of the chamber to rethink this course.\"\n\nGosar posted the video over week ago with a note saying, \"Any anime fans out there?\" The roughly 90-second video was an altered version of a Japanese anime clip, interspersed with shots of Border Patrol officers and migrants at the southern U.S. border.\n\nDuring one roughly 10-second section, animated characters whose faces had been replaced with Gosar.

The video also shows him attacking President Joe Biden.\n\n\"I don't know if it was to create harm, if it was to incite violence, if it was to fuel hate, but it probably accomplished all of those things,\" said Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas. \"We have an obligation to live up to the highest standards possible, but also to hold each other up to those standards. If we don't do it, then what we are doing is allowing for a new norm to be created.\"\n\nLast week, Gosar issued a statement saying the video wasn't meant to depict harm or violence, calling it instead \"a symbolic portrayal of a fight over immigration policy.\"\n\nHe told his House Republican colleagues during a private meeting Tuesday that he would never espouse violence or harm to anyone. Gosar noted that he took the video down from his account, according to a person in the room who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private meeting.\n\nOcasio-Cortez said Tuesday he has not apologized to her.\n\n\"It's been well over a week. He not only has not apologized,\" she said. \"He not only has not made any sort of contact or outreach, neither he nor the Republican leader (Kevin) McCarthy, but he has also doubled down by saying that I am somehow, you know, representative of undocumented people.\"\n\n\"In a perfect world, he'd be expelled,\" she told reporters. \"We are not in a perfect world, so censure and removal from committee I believe is appropriate.\"\n\nThe resolution coming up for a vote states that depictions of violence can foment actual violence and jeopardize the safety of elected officials. It also cites the insurrection of the Capitol on Jan. 6 as an example. The resolution goes on to say that violence against women in politics is a global phenomenon meant to silence and discourage them from seeking positions of authority and participating in public life, with women of color disproportionately impacted.\n\nA censure resolution, if approved by a majority of the House, requires the censured lawmaker to stand in the well of the House as the resolution of censure is read aloud by the House speaker.\n\nThe House has censured its members on 23 occasions. The last censure resolution was approved in 2010 involving Democratic Rep. Charles Rangel, the former chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, for financial misconduct. The censure carries no practical effect, except to provide a historic footnote that marks a lawmaker's career.\n\nThe censure resolution also calls for Gosar's removal from the two committees he serves on: the Committee on Natural Resources and Committee on Oversight and Reform, which includes Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., was one of the few Republicans saying he would vote to censure Gosar.\n\n\"We have to hold Members accountable who incite or glorify violence, who spread and perpetuate dangerous conspiracies. The failure to do so will take us one step closer to this fantasized violence becoming real,\" Kinzinger tweeted.\n\n--\n\nAssociated Press staff writer Alan Fram contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Steve Helber, File)\n\nPHOENIX (AP) - A judge in Phoenix has dismissed lawsuits seeking to disqualify three Republican lawmakers from this year's ballot because they participated in or helped organize the Jan. 6, 2021, rally in Washington that led to an unprecedented attack on Congress.\n\nThe decision from Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Christopher Coury made public Friday means Reps. Paul Gosar and Andy Biggs and state Rep. Mark Finchem remain on the primary ballot barring a reversal by the state Supreme Court. Gosar and Biggs are seeking reelection and Finchem is running for Secretary of State, Arizona's chief election officer.\n\nThe lawsuits filed on behalf of a handful of Arizona voters alleged that Gosar, Biggs and Finchem can't hold office because they participated in an insurrection. They cited a section of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. constitution enacted after the Civil War.\n\nNone of the lawmakers are accused of participating in the actual attack on Congress that was intended to stop certification of President Joe Biden's win.\n\nCoury agreed with the lawmakers' attorneys who said Congress created no enforcement mechanism for the 14th Amendment, barring a criminal conviction. He noted that Congress proposed such a law in the wake of the attack on Congress but it is not been enacted.\n\n\"Therefore, given the current state of the law and in accordance with the United States Constitution, plaintiffs have no private right of action to assert claims under the disqualification clause,\" Coury wrote.\n\nHe also rejected arguments that state law created an enforcement mechanism that allows people to sue to enforce the 14th Amendment's provision. And he said, at least for Biggs and Gosar, qualifications for member of Congress are purely a federal affair.\n\n\"The text of the Constitution is mandatory,\" Coury wrote. \"It sets forth the single arbiter of the qualifications of members of Congress; that single arbiter is Congress.\"\n\nThe attorney representing the voters who challenged the lawmakers, Jim Barton, urged Coury on Wednesday to hold a planned three-day trial even if he dismissed the case. But Coury declined to do so, noting that election challenge cases are by definition rushed and not the proper place for such legal wrangling.\n\n\"Arizona's election challenge framework is ill-suited for the detailed analysis of the complex constitutional, legal and factual issues presented in this case,\" he wrote.\n\nCoury noted that Gosar's lawyer, Alexander Kolodin, raised free speech issues. And Kolodin stressed that after Friday's ruling became public.\n\n\"If the radical left wants our courts to punish dissenting speech, they came to the wrong state,\" Kolodin said.\n\nFree Speech For People, the group representing the Arizona voters, vowed an appeal to the Arizona Supreme Court, saying Coury's ruling \"is contrary to the law.\"\n\n\"Arizona is not exempted from the mandate of Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution,\" the group said in a statement. \"A candidate who has taken an oath of office and then engaged in insurrection has no place on a future Arizona ballot.\"\n\nThe rally where former President Donald Trump spoke and urged attendees to march on the Capitol led to deadly clashes. Protestors forced their way into Congress while lawmakers were certifying President Joe Biden's 2020 victory.\n\nThe Arizona lawsuits are mirrored in complaints now being pursued by Free Speech for People attorneys against sitting members of Congress from Georgia and North Carolina.\n\nVoters in Georgia are trying to get firebrand Republican and Trump supporter Marjorie Taylor Greene thrown off the ballot for similar reasons. She was in court Friday.\n\nAnd voters in western North Carolina want Republican U.S. Rep. Madison Cawthorn, who spoke at the rally that preceded the riot, tossed from the ballot.\n\nCawthorn sued and a federal judge last month blocked the challenge filed with the state's election board from moving forward, writing that laws approved by Congress in 1872 and 1898 mean the 14th Amendment section can't apply to current House members.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Paul Gosar, to pay $75,000 in attorney fees for filing a defamation suit against a former Democratic lawmaker \"primarily for purposes of harassment.\"\n\nThe Republicans filed the lawsuit last year against former Democratic state Rep. Charlene Fernandez after she called for an investigation of their roles in the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. The judge dismissed the lawsuit in April, saying Fernandez's request was protected by the First Amendment's rights to free speech and to petition the government.\n\nThe lawsuit was \"groundless and not made in good faith,\" Yuma County Judge Pro Tem Levi Gunderson ruled on Monday, adding that it appeared to have been \"written for an audience other than the assigned trial court judge.\"\n\nGunderson said legal filings by the Republicans made irrelevant references to open borders and Democrats Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.\n\nThe lawsuit \"was brought for an improper purpose, having been filed against a political opponent primarily for purposes of harassment,\" he added.\n\nFernandez and 41 other Democratic lawmakers signed a letter on Jan. 12, 2021, urging the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate Finchem, Gosar, then-state Rep. Anthony Kern and U.S. Rep. Andy Biggs, all Republicans from Arizona. Finchem and Kern were outside the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, while Gosar and Biggs are under scrutiny for their roles in supporting protests leading up to the counting of electoral votes that day. All have denied wrongdoing.\n\nFinchem and Kern, who is running for the state Senate this year, sued Fernandez and were later joined in the suit by Gosar. They claimed the letter was a smear and that Fernandez \"baselessly\" accused them of the \"highest possible crimes against the Government of the United States.\"\n\nFinchem said in a text message that he is evaluating his options. A person who answered a cell phone number that Kern has previously used hung up when a reporter identified himself and did not respond to a text message. A spokesman for Gosar did not respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nOf the 42 Democrats who signed the letter, Fernandez was the only one who was sued. She was previously the House Democratic leader but was not in Democratic leadership at the time the letter was signed and publicly released. Fernandez resigned from the Legislature last year to take a job in President Joe Biden's administration.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

Paul Gosar tweeted a video showing a character with his face killing a figure with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's face. Several of the 13 House Republicans who backed a bipartisan infrastructure bill said they faced threats after their vote. In one profanity-laced voicemail, a caller labeled Rep. Fred Upton a \"traitor\" and wished death for the Michigan Republican, his family and staff.\n\nThe response from Republican leaders? Silence.\n\nLess than a year after former President Donald Trump's supporters staged a violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol in an effort to halt the peaceful transition of power, the GOP's refusal to broadly and forcefully condemn more recent examples of disturbing rhetoric and behavior suggests an unsettling shift. One of the nation's two major political parties appears increasingly tolerant of at least some persistent level of violence in American discourse, or at least willing to turn a blind eye to it.\n\nIn an interview, GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, who has emerged as a top Trump critic in her party, said Gosar should be censured \"for his continued indefensible activities.\" And she blasted House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy for his silence on the matter.\n\n\"It's a real symbol of his lack of strength, the lack of leadership in our conference right now, and the extent to which he and other leaders seem to have lost their moral compass,\" said Cheney, who was ousted from her leadership post after voting in favor of Trump's second impeachment . \"In a moment where you've got an avowed white nationalist in Rep. Gosar who has posted a video advocating the killing of another member, the idea that our leader will not stand against that but that he's somehow going after and allowing attacks against 13 members who are conducting themselves in a serious and substantive way is really outrageous.\"\n\nRepresentatives for McCarthy did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nPressed on violent rhetoric in their own ranks, Republicans often point to protests in Portland, Oregon, involving left-wing antifa activists. But President Joe Biden has said those engaged in violence should be prosecuted. And in 2018, then-House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi criticized fellow California Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters for calling on supporters to harass Trump administration officials.\n\nThe GOP's reluctance to crack down on - or even mildly criticize - violent rhetoric in its own ranks is part of a broader pattern in which the party tries to minimize such behavior. Gosar removed the tweet aimed at Ocasio-Cortez, but the Arizona congressman and his digital director said those offended by his tweet should \"relax.\" Trump, meanwhile, has attempted to divert attention from the Jan. 6 violence at the U.S. Capitol by saying that last year's Election Day was the \"real insurrection.\"\n\nThere was no insurrection on Election Day. There was a free and fair election won by Biden.\n\nWhile threats and violent political imagery are nothing new in American politics, they became increasingly normalized under Trump. The former president embraced violence as a political tactic from the earliest days of his 2016 campaign, egging on his supporters to rough up protesters who interrupted his rallies. At one point during a speech, he called on them to \"knock the crap out of\" potential disruptors, and even promised to pay their legal bills.\n\nIn office, Trump mulled having U.S. officials shoot at people trying to cross the border illegally and spoke of the good old days when he said police could rough up suspects with impunity. He labeled the press the \"enemy of the state\" and praised as \"my type\" the now Montana governor who physically assaulted a reporter.\n\nIn 2017, Trump tweeted a doctored World Wrestling Entertainment video that depicted him body-slamming and pummeling wrestling promoter Vince McMahon, whose face had been replaced by a CNN logo. The video quickly became the former president's then most-shared post on the site.\n\nAnd he spent months convincing his supporters the 2020 election had been stolen, culminating in the violent storming of the Capitol building in an effort to halt the certification of Biden's win. In an interview with ABC's Jonathan Karl for an upcoming book, Trump further defended the rioters who had chanted \"Hang Mike Pence!\" as they stormed the building, saying they were \"very angry\" and that he believed his former vice president was \"well-protected\" as he fled for his life, according to a partial transcript published by Axios.\n\nTrump \"seems to have wanted to promote opponents as being intimidated by wielding violent rhetoric,\" creating a culture, especially in the Republican Party, of \"violent threats as being excused as offbeat humor,\" said presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, of the precedent Trump had established.\n\nNonetheless, he said that having a congressman threaten somebody, \"whether it's in a cartoon or words,\" puts a target on her back.\n\n\"Knowing that AOC is facing serious death threats and then to turn it into a meme or a dark twisted fantasy joke is reprehensible. And it's hard to imagine that somebody in 2021 would feel that that kind of behavior was acceptable in a civil society,\" he said, calling for criminal prosecution. \"We cannot go around and threaten people's lives and call it humor.\"\n\nFormer Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who suffered extensive brain damage during a 2011 assassination attempt , said threats against political figures \"have no place in our democracy.\"\n\n\"Not only do they threaten the personal safety of our public servants, their staff, and their families - they undermine the very foundation of our democracy,\" she said in a statement. \"All leaders must decisively condemn violent rhetoric and threats in our politics, and recognize the danger to our democratic process posed by armed threats, harassment, and intimidation.\"\n\nCharlie Dent, a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania, said it was time for the party to rein in the rhetoric.\n\n\"I do think GOP leadership has to step up and address issues of members who step out of line as it relates to misconduct or incendiary comments,\" he said. \"They should be very forceful to those who are bringing discredit to the institution.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez spokesperson Lauren Hitt declined to comment on the volume of threats against her, citing security advice.\n\nLilliana Hall Mason is a professor at Johns Hopkins University and co-author of the upcoming book \"Radical American Partisanship,\" which examines Americans' attitudes toward political violence. She said that, in general, around 10% to 20% of self-identified Democrats and Republicans tell researchers they support the use of violence for accomplishing political goals.\n\nBut their studies found those attitudes can be strongly influenced by messages they hear from political leaders. When politicians use pacifying rhetoric, she said, people from both parties respond by becoming less approving of violence. But when Democrats hear violent rhetoric from Republicans, and vice versa, it feeds into perceptions that the opposite party is more approving of violence than it really is, and encourages them to respond with the same.\n\n\"It seems that people respond to violence events by increasing their approval to violence,\" she said of their findings. \"Violence begets violence\" in what she described as a \"vicious cycle\" that make using violent rhetoric \"a really dangerous game.\"\n\n\"It's just so irresponsible,\" she added.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Alan Fram contributed to this report from Washington.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Welcome to the Age of Lawless Masculinity\n\nRepresentative Paul Gosar's murderous and misogynistic video takes a page-albeit an extreme one-straight out of the authoritarian playbook.\n\nUpdated at 4:45 p.m. on November 20, 2021.\n\nIn 2008, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi invited his good friend Vladimir Putin to Sardinia, where Berlusconi had a vacation home, to discuss Italy and Russia's business and energy ties. At a joint press conference held during the visit, the Russian journalist Natalia Melikova asked Putin a question about his rumored relationship with the former Olympic gymnast Alina Kabaeva. As an angry Putin stayed silent and cameras rolled, Berlusconi mimicked shooting Melikova. The Italian press dismissed this and similar acts by the prime minister as \" gaffes, \" treating them as little more than social faux pas. Yet they were much more than that. Humiliating women, or even mimicking shooting them, was central to Berlusconi's strongman brand and a key to his power\n\nExercising an autocratic style of governance within a nominal democracy, Berlusconi cultivated an image as a virile leader untouchable by the law and able to have whatever and whomever he wanted, on demand. The commercial-television networks and ad agencies he owned mirrored his misogynist actions, saturating Italy with images of women in submissive and degrading roles. By 2011, when the Eurozone crisis forced Berlusconi out of office, he had survived 20 indictments and seven convictions for corruption, and a sex scandal involving a minor, without losing the support of his base or going to prison. But a United Nations Commission report that year warned that persistent portrayals of women as \"sex objects\" by politicians and the media lowered women's social status, leaving them vulnerable to discrimination. \"This man offends women and offends democracy,\" a feminist manifesto published in La Repubblica had warned two years earlier.\n\nAuthoritarianism has evolved over the past century , and old-school dictatorships are now joined by electoral autocracies. Yet at least one constant remains: Illiberal political solutions tend to take hold when increased gender equity and emancipation spark anxieties about male authority and status. A conquest-without-consequences masculinity, posing as a \"return to traditional values,\" tracks with authoritarianism's rise and parallels the discarding of the rule of law and accountability in politics. We commonly associate autocracy with state restrictions on behavior, but the removal of checks on actions deemed unethical in democratic contexts (lying, thievery, even rape and murder) is equally important to its operation and appeal.\n\nThat's why it's unsurprising to see a culture of lawless masculinity developing within the GOP, which adopted an authoritarian political culture during the Trump years. Renouncing democratic norms, the Republicans have normalized disinformation, election subversion, and violence as a means of governance, as expressed in their support for the January 6 coup attempt and the fiction that Donald Trump, not Joe Biden, won the 2020 election.\n\nRead: The 'pussy' presidency\n\nIt's symptomatic that a recent Fox News chyron trumpeted the need to \"embrace masculinity,\" and that Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri now styles himself the defender of \"traditional masculine virtues-things like courage and independence and assertiveness\" against a left trying to \"feminize\" men. The fist pump Hawley gave to the insurgents who had gathered to assault the Capitol hints at the real political agenda behind such calls for renewed male strength .\n\nThe anime-style video that Representative Paul Gosar of Arizona recently released , which spins a male fantasy of being acclaimed for murdering a female adversary, typifies the feelings of empowerment that come from belonging to a group that has legitimized criminal behavior. In it, an idealized Gosar saves the nation, attacking President Biden with swords and killing Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. While Democrats have called for Gosar's expulsion from Congress and passed a measure on Wednesday to formally censure him, the strategic silence of the GOP leader Kevin McCarthy gives tacit approval to this public expression by a sitting lawmaker of murderous misogynist rage.\n\nFlamboyant virility has always tended to go hand in hand with authoritarian politics, which is driven by the need to possess and exploit bodies, minds, national resources, and more. It's easy to laugh at the pectoral-baring performances of Mussolini and Vladimir Putin , and dismiss the rape jokes made by Jair Bolsonaro and Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, but the strongman style of leadership responds to perceived threats to male authority by upholding patriarchal privilege and the rights of men to satisfy their \"natural\" male desires.\n\nTrump announced his allegiance to this tradition early on. \"I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone and I wouldn't lose voters,\" he asserted in January 2016. In October of that year, his assaultive approach to women became public through the leak of the 2005 Access Hollywood tape (\"When you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything,\" Trump said). In spite of widespread predictions that the leak would be the end of the Trump campaign, it merely enhanced his macho profile.\n\nThe ethos of lawless masculinity is a lubricant of corruption, normalizing behaviors and redefining illegal or immoral acts as acceptable, from election fraud to sexual assault. These new norms attract collaborators who find it thrilling to be able to commit criminal acts with impunity. (Gosar used promises of blanket pardons to recruit participants for the January 6 coup attempt.)\n\nFrom the June 2015 issue: Why it pays to be a jerk\n\nCharismatic authoritarians diffuse models of power based on brute force, and soon the political system spawns individuals who earn status by imitating them. The Italian dictator Benito Mussolini had surrogates and proxies who repeated his hypermasculine performances and bombastic oratory, starting with his son-in-law, Galeazzo Ciano, who mimicked Il Duce's chin thrusts, earning the nickname \"The Jaw.\" The Italian writer Italo Calvino, who grew up during the dictatorship, recalled how his generation internalized the gestures, opinions, and behaviors of Mussolini from an early age.\n\nTrump's success at birthing mini-Trumps is notable, considering that he governed in an open society for only four years (so far, at least). Mike Pompeo, who as secretary of state violated ethics standards and screamed obscenities at a female journalist, boasted about leading through \"swagger,\" while Florida Governor Ron DeSantis's 2018 campaign identity as a \" pitbull Trump defender\" has become so entrenched three years later that he routinely mimics the former president's hand gestures.\n\nIn classic authoritarian fashion, Trump attracted collaborators by making it easier for men to act on their desires without fear of punishment. In 2019, his administration partly decriminalized domestic violence, limiting its definition to physical acts of harm (which effectively legalized sexual, emotional, economic, and psychological actions or threats of actions). Trump also defended men accused of sexual harassment and sexual assault, including Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and populated high-profile government positions with men, including Steve Bannon, who were accused of sexual harassment, domestic abuse, or inappropriate workplace behavior. How fitting that his chief of protocol, Sean Lawler, carried a horsewhip around in the office to intimidate co-workers.\n\nWhether or not Trump returns to office, the GOP has made his brand of outlaw glamour its own. A real man takes what he wants, when he wants it, whether in the bedroom, the workplace, or politics, and pays no penalty. As the Republican quest to destroy democracy intensifies, so will abusive, predatory, and criminal behavior be further enabled and justified. For a century, \"getting away with it\" has been central to authoritarianism's allure, and it will be no different as the American version of illiberal rule unfolds.\n\nThis article originally stated that Silvio Berlusconi once grabbed a female traffic cop from behind and simulated copulation. Though accounts vary as to the origin and veracity of this anecdote, the video clip linked to in the description was from a fictional, satirical film about Berlusconi."

      "text": "'Anglo-Saxon' Is What You Say When 'Whites Only' Is Too Inclusive\n\nA new message proves too toxic for the Republican Party.\n\nLast week, far-right Republican Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar distanced themselves from a proposal to create an America First Caucus, after a document bearing the group's name made reference to \"Anglo-Saxon political traditions.\"\n\nBoth Greene and Gosar told the press that they hadn't seen the document and did not endorse its sentiments, after House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy condemned the effort , saying that America \"isn't built on identity, race, or religion,\" and rejecting \"nativist dog whistles.\"\n\nIf seeing the party of Donald Trump distance itself from nativism is strange, it helps to understand that \"Anglo-Saxon\" is what you say when \"whites only\" is simply too inclusive.\n\nFrom the April 2019 issue: White nationalism's deep American roots\n\nThe Anglo-Saxonism to which I refer has little to do with the Germanic peoples who settled in medieval England. Rather, it's an archaic, pseudoscientific intellectual trend that gained popularity during the height of immigration from Eastern and Southern Europe to the United States, at the turn of the 20th century. Nativists needed a way to explain why these immigrants-Polish, Russian, Greek, Italian, and Jewish-were distinct from earlier generations, and why their presence posed a danger.\n\nThey settled on the idea that the original \"native\" American settlers were descended from \"the tribes that met under the oak-trees of old Germany to make laws and choose chieftains,\" as Francis Walker put it in The Atlantic in 1893, and that the new immigrants lacked the biological aptitude for democracy. Anglo-Saxon was a way to distinguish genteel old-money types, such as nativist Republican Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, from members of inferior races who had names such as, well, McCarthy . The influential eugenicist Madison Grant insisted that the Irish possessed an \"unstable temperament\" and a \"lack of coordinating and reasoning power.\"\n\n\"By making the simple (and in fact traditional) assumption that northern European nationalities shared much of the Anglo-Saxon's inherited traits, a racial nativist could now understand why immigration had just now become a problem,\" the historian John Higham wrote in Strangers in the Land . \"Also, the cultural remoteness of southern and eastern European 'races' suggested to him that the foreign danger involved much more than an inherited incapacity for self-government: the new immigration was racially impervious to the whole of American civilization!\"\n\nThis belief that America's \"original\" population was Anglo-Saxon, and that the American way of life was threatened by the presence not just of nonwhite people but of inferior, non-Anglo-Saxon (or \"Nordic\") white people, shaped the racist immigration-restriction laws of the early 20th century. As historians have documented, it also influenced the ideology of Nazi Germany . Translated into law, it produced such horrifying artifacts as Virginia's 1924 anti-miscegenation act, passed with the aid of the eugenicist Anglo-Saxon Clubs. The law required all babies to be classified as \"white\" or \"colored\" and made it a felony to \"misrepresent\" your racial background. The Nazi jurists studying American race laws in the 1930s thought such \"one drop\" rules were a bit too strict.\n\nAdam Serwer: The cruelty is the point\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon Clubs naturally denied any racist intent, as the historian Edwin Black writes in War Against the Weak: Eugenics and America's Campaign to Create a Master Race . \"'One drop of negro blood makes the negro' is no longer a theory based on race pride or color prejudice, but a logically induced, scientific fact,\" the groups claimed, adding that their objective was to maintain \"the supremacy of the white race in the United States of America, without racial prejudice or hatred.\" Got that?\n\nDespite McCarthy's effort to distance the GOP from the America First Caucus document, it's clear that prominent Trumpist officials and intellectuals, some of them descended from the very immigrant groups Anglo-Saxon was intended to vilify, agree with some of the presumptions of Anglo-Saxonism. The echo of the notion that, as Francis Walker wrote, non-Anglo-Saxons are biologically incapable of \"self-care and self-government\" can be heard regularly on outlets such as Fox News, where hosts like Tucker Carlson argue that Democrats wish to \"replace the current electorate, the voters now casting ballots, with new people, more obedient voters from the Third World.\" This is biological determinism, but it's also simply false. The Republican Party is now led by the descendants of the people Walker decried as incapable of self-government, people with surnames like Giuliani and Pompeo, even as it launches these old calumnies at a new generation of immigrants.\n\nThe document outlining the priorities for the America First Caucus, a name with an equally odious pedigree , makes similar arguments. \"An important distinction between post-1965 immigrants and previous waves of settlers is that previous cohorts were more educated, earned higher wages, and did not have an expansive welfare state to fall back on when they could not make it in America and thus did not stay in the country at the expense of the native-born,\" the document reads.\n\nThis is utter fantasy. European immigrants at the turn of the century faced nothing like the restrictions that prospective immigrants face today, let alone the immense, militarized deportation machine Americans have come to accept. They were poor, uneducated, and didn't even need to speak English to enter the country; a minuscule fraction were excluded. The distinction between immigration before and after 1965 is that in that year, the U.S. repealed restrictions based on race and ethnicity that almost entirely prevented immigration from Asia and Africa. The America First Caucus document's falsehoods about post-1965 immigration echo Anglo-Saxonism's pseudoscientific presumptions that recent immigrants are somehow qualitatively incapable of \"self-care and self-government.\"\n\nThe 2020 election showed that the Republican Party could embrace conservative positions, even on immigration, and still appeal to Latino voters. But the ideological predilections of Anglo-Saxonism definitionally exclude that part of the Republican base, sending a clear message that they and other voters of color are unwelcome in the party, and threatening those electoral gains. They replace a message of restriction, or even law and order, with one rooted in racial purity. McCarthy's forceful condemnation of that message is one small example of how a more diverse base of voters can work as a check against bigotry within a political party, even if it's only a single step in the right direction, against weak actors it takes little courage to condemn."

      "text": "The GOP Can't Hide From Extremism\n\nA perfect storm is brewing among Trump, Fuentes, Ye ... and Twitter.\n\nThe role of extremist white nationalists in the GOP may be approaching an inflection point.\n\nThe backlash against former President Donald Trump's meeting with Nick Fuentes, an avowed racist, anti-Semite, and Christian nationalist, has compelled more Republican officeholders than at any point since the Charlottesville riot in 2017 to publicly condemn those extremist views.\n\nYet few GOP officials have criticized the former president personally-much less declared that Trump's meeting with Fuentes and Ye, the rapper (formerly known as Kanye West) who has become a geyser of anti-Semitic bile, renders him unfit to serve as president again .\n\nEven this distancing from Fuentes (if not Trump) comes as House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, the putative next speaker, is poised to restore prominent committee assignments for Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar, two House Republicans who have publicly associated with Fuentes. It also comes as Republican officials, including McCarthy and Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida, are locking arms in support of Elon Musk's push to allow extremist voices more access to Twitter.\n\nAlthough it took days to develop, some believe the widespread Republican criticism of Trump's meeting could signal a new determination to restore the barriers between mainstream conservatism and far-right Christian and white nationalism that eroded during the Trump era.\n\nBrian Klass: The Trump apocalypse has not been canceled\n\nElizabeth Neumann, a former assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security under Trump who focused on domestic extremism, told me she believes the backlash-however belated-combined with the GOP's disappointing performance in last month's midterm elections, could mark a turning point. \"I think we are going to be playing footsie with fascism and authoritarianism and extremism for a while,\" because it helped Trump win the presidency in 2016 and sustain his support thereafter, she said. But, she added, after several years of feeling \"very pessimistic\" about the prospect of weakening those movements, \"this is the first time I've felt there might be some light at the end of the tunnel.\"\n\nYet others remain unconvinced that the GOP is ready to fundamentally break with Trump or ostracize the coalition's overtly racist, homophobic, and anti-Semitic white supremacists and Christian nationalists. \"I think what we are looking at is the entrenchment of extremism, and that's what is so worrisome,\" Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, told me.\n\nIf anything, extremist groups could gain momentum in the coming months. Musk's proposed mass amnesty for banned Twitter accounts would provide \"a tremendous amount of oxygen to extremists on the radical right\" and allow those groups to push back much harder against any Republican elected officials resisting their presence in the party, Michael Edison Hayden of the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project told me. If Musk opens the door to extremist organizing on Twitter, Hayden said, the white-nationalist presence in the GOP coalition will become \"potentially irreversible in the short term.\"\n\nTrump famously declared that there were \"very fine people on both sides\" of the neo-Nazi riot against the removal of confederate monuments in Charlottesville, Virginia, during his first year in office. Asked to denounce the extremist Proud Boys during one 2020 presidential debate, Trump instead told them to \" stand back and stand by .\" After the January 6 insurrection, in which white-supremacist groups played a central role, the overwhelming majority of House and Senate Republicans voted against impeaching or convicting Trump for spurring the violence. More recently, hardly any Republicans have raised objections to Trump repeatedly floating the possibility of providing mass pardons (and even government apologies) to the insurrectionists if he wins the presidency again in 2024.\n\nOther officials inside the GOP coalition have pushed through the boundaries Trump has weakened. Gosar and Greene both appeared at Fuentes's America First Political Action Conference. So did Republican Arizona State Senator Wendy Rogers, who called the audience at one of the events \"patriots,\" and declared, \"We need to build more gallows. If we try some of these high-level criminals, convict them, and use a newly built set of gallows, it'll make an example of these traitors who have betrayed our country.\"\n\nThe Republican-controlled Arizona State Senate censured Rogers this year for threatening her colleagues, but she was nevertheless fulsomely embraced by Kari Lake , the Republican nominee for Arizona governor this year. Other prominent GOP candidates, including Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania, also associated with white and Christian nationalists or directly echoed themes from those movements this year.\n\nIn a similar vein, in the days before the election, McCarthy made clear that he would restore committee assignments to Greene and Gosar, whom the Democratic majority had stripped of such roles for their association with extremists and embrace of violent imagery. McCarthy also promised Greene and other hard-line conservatives that he would authorize an investigation into the government's prosecution and treatment of the January 6 insurrectionists, many of whom are extremists tied to white and Christian nationalism.\n\n\"After Trump's rise, these barriers became softer and softer, and they really broke down in the aftermath of January 6 altogether,\" Hayden said. \"And now you have this kind of opening between the fringe world and the mainstream world in a way that is very difficult to separate.\"\n\nMusk has quickly become a major new factor in further razing those barriers between the far right and the conservative mainstream, restoring the Twitter accounts of figures banned for misinformation, promotion of violence, or intimidation-including Trump and Greene. Hayden said the Southern Poverty Law Center's research shows that some previously banned white nationalists have already been restored to the site.\n\nIn a torrent of combative posts, Musk wrapped himself in the mantle of \"free speech\" to justify restoring accounts previously banned for violating the site's standards. And he's accused individuals and institutions that argue for drawing a line against extremist rhetoric of threatening the core American value of free expression. In Musk's formulation, even the most noxious forms of hate speech can be justified as free speech, and any effort to combat divisive rhetoric is an un-American attempt at censorship or intimidation by the \"woke\" mob. \"This is a battle for the future of civilization,\" Musk insisted in one tweet . \"If free speech is lost even in America, tyranny is all that lies ahead.\" That's quite a minuet: According to Musk's logic, it's a form of \"tyranny\" to oppose his amplification of authoritarian, racist, and neo-Nazi views antithetical to democracy.\n\nThe rush of GOP leaders such as McCarthy , DeSantis, and incoming House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan to support Musk as he works to restore more banned accounts shows how hard it will be for the GOP to completely divorce itself from white and Christian nationalism. So does McCarthy's pledge to restore committee assignments to Greene and Gosar, as well as the reluctance of almost all GOP officials to directly criticize Trump.\n\nPolling by the Associated Press and the National Opinion Research Center has found that only about one in 11 Republicans expresses directly favorable views of white-nationalist groups such as the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers ( whose leader, Stewart Rhodes, was convicted this week of seditious conspiracy for his role in the January 6 attack ).\n\nBut a much larger slice of Republican partisans express views that might be called white-nationalist adjacent. In various polls, preponderant majorities of GOP voters have said that discrimination against white people is now as big a problem as bias against minorities, that Christianity in the U.S. is under assault, and that the growing number of immigrants threatens American values and traditions. About half of Republicans have expressed agreement in other polls with tenets of white nationalism, including the racist \"replacement theory\" that elites are importing immigrants to undermine the political power of native-born white people, the core Christian-nationalist belief that \" God intended America to be a new promised land ,\" and the assertion that \" the traditional American way of life is disappearing so fast that we may have to use force to save it .\"\n\nOnly a minuscule percentage of those Republican partisans might contemplate violence or join extremist organizations, Neumann and other experts point out. But the receptivity of so many Republican voters to arguments, even if less virulent, that overlap with those championed by white- and Christian-nationalist organizations may be a crucial reason for party leaders' reluctance to confront Trump and others, like Greene, who have associated with such groups. Given the extent of such views inside the GOP coalition, Neumann said, Republicans feel no political incentive to reject the far right \"other than out of the goodness of their heart and moral clarity. And apparently that wasn't enough.\"\n\nNeumann, now the chief strategy officer of Moonshot, a company that combats online extremism, worries that organized far-right violence could still erupt if Trump ever faces a trial as a result of the various investigations targeting him. But she sees the possibility that the visibility and influence of the extreme right inside the GOP peaked with this fall's converging events, especially the party's disappointing election results. \"I really do think this is, like, a 10-, 20-year process,\" she told me, but \"I have a slight hope that this sticks and that we move past it.\"\n\nDavid Frum: A ploy, not a principle\n\nRobert P. Jones, the president and founder of the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute and the author of White Too Long , a history of Christian nationalism, is less optimistic. He believes Christian-nationalist beliefs are spreading more widely among Trump's followers because they believe \"they are at a kind of 'last stand' moment\" for their vision of a white-Christian-dominated America. \"The unwillingness of party leaders, time and time again, to denounce Trump for giving these voices support and cover has allowed them to move into the center of the GOP today,\" Jones wrote to me in an email. \"I would be surprised if we didn't see increasing numbers of GOP party leaders openly associating with these voices in the future, particularly leading up to the 2024 presidential election.\"\n\nGreenblatt is also less sanguine. The Anti-Defamation League tracked more than 2,700 anti-Semitic incidents in 2021-the highest annual total it has ever recorded and triple the number of incidents it documented as recently as 2015, the last year before Trump emerged as the GOP's leading man. Furthermore, Greenblatt is unconvinced that the current Republican distancing from Trump will last any longer than it did in earlier episodes, such as Charlottesville. And he worries that Musk is on course to radically increase the volume of racist and anti-Semitic hate speech on Twitter, which was already a problem before Musk bought the company.\n\nOn all of these fronts, Greenblatt sees what he calls \"the normalization of extremism\" hardening in ways that would have been unimaginable only a few years ago. \"Society itself is at risk if we don't finally move the extremists ... out of the mainstream, back to the margins where they belong,\" he told me. \"I think we don't realize the peril that we run, the risk that's upon us, if we don't get this right.\""

      "text": "Conservatives Try to Rebrand the Coronavirus\n\nThe term Wuhan virus treats COVID-19 as a Chinese scourge-and ignores an ugly history.\n\nUntil recently, Representative Paul Gosar, a Republican from Arizona, was most famous for tweeting a lie: a faked photo of President Barack Obama shaking hands with Hassan Rouhani, the president of Iran. This weekend, Gosar made news with another tweet : In response to the report that he had been in contact with a man confirmed to have contracted the novel coronavirus, he announced that he was placing himself in self-quarantine from what he called the \"Wuhan virus.\"\n\nScientists are using the internationally accepted name COVID-19 to describe the disease caused by the novel coronavirus that was discovered late last year. But a number of prominent conservatives-including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas-are going with Wuhan virus , as if the deadly new pathogen were one more scourge to be blamed on the Chinese. As many of the responses to Gosar on Twitter pointed out, this kind of rhetoric invites the public to see a global epidemic in racial or (at best) geopolitical terms.\n\nDefenders of the term countered both that the virus did appear first in a real place called Wuhan, and that many diseases are named after the site of a first or famous outbreak. That's true of the viral hemorrhagic infections Ebola and Marburg, tick-borne Lyme disease, and others. But the geographic defense has to be weighed against the rhetoric that says out loud what locating the current threat to Wuhan only implies.\n\nIn the past five years, Donald Trump has explicitly promoted the notion that foreigners carry contagion. In 2015 he proclaimed that Mexicans were to blame for \"tremendous infectious disease ... pouring across the border,\" a charge he has repeated as president. Meanwhile, the deliberate cultivation of fears of infectious disease from China has a long, nasty history in the United States-one that even today's bitter partisans should be willing to acknowledge.\n\nHawaii had been in turmoil through much of the 1890s, especially after 1893, when white immigrants from the United States overthrew the last Hawaiian monarch, Queen Lili'uokalani. Her efforts to regain power failed, and the United States annexed the islands in 1898. The next year, in November, a ship outbound from Hong Kong made port in Honolulu. At least one passenger made his or her way to the city's Chinatown. On December 12, the disease that unidentified traveler had carried announced itself in the death of a 22-year-old Chinese bookkeeper named You Chong, the first victim on American territory of what is now known as the third global pandemic of the bubonic plague. Four more Chinatown residents became sick and died soon after.\n\nLocal officials reacted swiftly and decisively. Chinatown was cordoned off, locking about 10,000 people in place, and the local board of health acted on its theory of the infection: The bubonic plague was caused by the dirt-the word used was \"filth\"-and packed conditions in which Honolulu's Chinese residents lived.\n\nIf the muck the white authorities saw bred into the lives and habits of the Chinese really was the cauldron in which disease brewed, then the solution was obvious. As the historian Nayan Shah writes, the head of the board of health, Henry Cooper, ordered the creation of a literal firebreak between the supposed reservoir of disease in Chinatown and the rest of the city. On January 20, officials set what was supposed to be a controlled burn, a strategic disinfection. Just as the first fires ignited, the wind picked up, embers flipped to neighboring roofs, and within the day, all of Chinatown was in flames. The fire burned for more than two weeks; 45,000 people lost their homes.\n\nA similar sequence of malign ignorance, combined with a depressingly contemporary money-motivated blindness would play out over the next few years as the disease moved on. The pandemic was already more than a century old when it reached Honolulu. It had started in China's Yunnan province in the 1770s, but had remained a mostly local outbreak until the 1850s, when a combination of civil war and the globalization created as European powers extended their empires sped the disease on its way. The plague reached China's coast in the 1870s, and from there, the ships that bore imperial trade carried the plague across the globe.\n\nInfection in Hawaii 20 years later delivered a clear message: The disease was still on the move. There was little doubt about its next destination: the American West Coast, and most likely its busiest port, San Francisco.\n\nIts journey didn't take long. The first documented victim, a Chinese laborer named Wong Chut King, died in San Francisco's Chinatown on March 6, 1900. The outbreak that followed lasted until 1904, killing more than one hundred people, most of them Chinese. The established racial mythology of the day-that the Chinese were alien threats, vectors of social contagion-molded the city's response. On March 7, the day after Wong died, a rope barrier appeared around Chinatown, and police forced every ethnic Chinese person to remain confined in the area-while allowing white people to leave. (For my account of these events I've relied on Gunther Risse's Plague, Fear, and Politics in San Francisco's Chinatown ; Nayan Shah's Contagious Divides: Epidemics and Race in San Francisco's Chinatown ; and David K. Randall's Black Death at the Golden Gate .)\n\nThe quarantine didn't hold-but in its place came proposals for a much more radical solution. If the packed and impenetrable Chinese neighborhood was the source of a dread disease, why not simply eradicate it, to achieve by design what Honolulu's firebrands had accomplished by accident? As the historian Gunther Risse reports, a newspaper said the quiet part out loud: Chinatown was a \"foul spot\" and \"the only way to get rid of that menace is to eradicate Chinatown from the city ... and give the debris to the flames.\" Burn it down, start again (not coincidentally, on a patch of prime real estate), and as for those who lived there? A member of the San Francisco Board of Health knew what to do: \"Every Chinese in Chinatown ought to be removed to a detention camp somewhere in the hills.\"\n\nSan Francisco's Chinatown survived the threat, of course; it's still there today. Its residents were not marched to the hills; California's Asian concentration camps would not appear until 1942 with the internment of residents of Japanese origin. But in a wholly depressing anticipation of our present-day predicament, the focus on an alleged ethnic link to the emergence and spread of the disease both fueled ongoing discrimination and made a terrifying epidemic worse.\n\nThen as now, leaders at first tried to minimize the sense of danger. Just as Trump and other political leaders initially downplayed the threat from COVID-19, city and state officials in California in the early 1900s tried to deny that the Chinatown deaths were due to the plague. Hoping to limit the economic damage that news of an epidemic would cause, they belittled the scientists and ignored their brand-new understanding that plague was caused by a bacterium carried by fleas riding on rats.\n\nOnce the reality of the outbreak was undeniable, the characterization of the plague as a disease born of a specifically Chinese squalor within the Chinatown ghetto delayed the response that the handful of trained public-health experts in place knew was necessary: eradicating the rats that could carry the disease beyond any quarantine line San Francisco's city fathers might choose to draw. As a result, the disease gained time and space in which to spread-first, across the bay in an almost all-white population, three years after San Francisco's last case in 1904, and then into rodent populations that spread across the American West, where plague remains endemic to this day.\n\nThat's the epidemiological price we're still paying for allowing racist tropes to drive disease response more than a century ago. And that provides the context in which to judge Gosar, Pompeo, Cotton, and others who seek to rebrand COVID-19 as a Chinese problem and blame one more of our afflictions on a malign outside entity. As in 1900, to insist on a geographic definition of disease today is to locate responsibility somewhere other than here. This is a cowardly evasion. But that's not the worst of it, at least in pragmatic terms. Now, as then, emphasizing place rather than the clinical details of how a disease works and spreads means that epidemics get a head start.\n\nWhat's in a name? Life and death."

Paul Gosar is preparing to file legislation to open up impeachment proceedings against Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy.\n\nGosar is circulating a letter to colleagues and plans to introduce a resolution this week calling for McCarthy's impeachment, charging that she delivered false testimony before Congress when testifying about a clean-water rule.\n\n\"Perjury and making false statements to Congress are an affront to the fundamental principles of our republic and the rule of law, and such behavior cannot be tolerated,\" Gosar's letter states. \"This bill holds Administrator McCarthy accountable for her blatant deceptions and unlawful conduct.\"\n\nAccording to Gosar, McCarthy lied before Congress when testifying about the Waters of the United States rule, which clarified the administration's authority under the 1972 Clean Water Act and gave it authority over more streams, waterways, and tributaries.\n\nMuch of Gosar's accusations have to do with the scientific backing for the water rule and consultation with the Army Corps of Engineers. Memos released after the rule's finalization have shown that Army Corps Maj. Gen. John Peabody expressed concerns to Assistant Army Secretary for Civil Works Jo-Ellen Darcy about changes being made to the final rule, including the scientific justification for some decisions. Through a spokesman, the EPA declined to comment.\n\nGosar points to a July 9 hearing before the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee where McCarthy described a decision in the final rule to extend federal regulation to wetlands and ponds within 4,000 feet of the nearest tributary, setting a definition for \"significant nexus.\" That decision, McCarthy said, came from \"the knowledge and expertise of our staff, the information that we received from the public and comments, and the science that's available to us.\"\n\nThe Army Corps memos show that officials there thought the 4,000-foot cutoff was arbitrary and could open the rule up to legal challenges.\n\nGosar also points to a June 10 House Transportation and Infrastructure hearing where McCarthy said that \"all of the changes that the Army Corps was interested in making ... had been fully satisfied,\" a statement the Republican congressman said constituted perjury. Gosar also said that McCarthy did not initially say that the Corps of Engineers had made her aware of the legal and scientific questions.\n\nThe Waters of the United States rule has proved to be one of the EPA's most controversial, with opponents saying it gives EPA too much regulatory power over certain bodies of water and oversteps states' rights. Twenty-eight states in total have challenged the rule in court across several lawsuits, and a federal judge in August granted an injunction blocking implementation of the rule in 13 states.\n\nAn aide for House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said simply, \"There is no plan to vote to impeach Gina McCarthy.\"\n\nIt's not the first time Gosar has taken such action against the Obama administration. Last year, he called for the impeachment of then-Attorney General Eric Holder, having previously spearheaded a successful bid to hold Holder in contempt of Congress."

      "text": "Why the GOP Extremists Oppose Ukraine\n\nThe budget fight was about vice signaling, not spending.\n\nThis is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\n\nRepublicans averted the self-inflicted wound of a government shutdown this weekend. The main casualty of the process was aid for Ukraine, but foreign aid was always a fig leaf-for both GOP dysfunction and the determination of a small group of Republicans to help Russia.\n\nFirst, here are three new stories from The Atlantic :\n\nIt's Not About the Money\n\nThe Republicans in Congress have delayed a shutdown for another 45 days while they continue their family food fight. They are all very angry with one another, and they seem to agree on only one issue: They hate Matt Gaetz . But don't blame Gaetz, who is clearly having the time of his life being famous. The Republicans, as the economist Michael Strain noted , have for weeks been careening toward a Seinfeld Shutdown, a budget impasse about ... nothing.\n\nSome $6 billion of aid to Ukraine, however, was removed from the budget, a temporary casualty of the near shutdown. (I say \"temporary\" because I have confidence that sensible members of Congress will act to restore the funds.) Republicans are trying to cloak their opposition to military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine in a lot of codswallop about oversight and budget discipline. But the opposition to aid for Ukraine among Republican extremists on the Hill is not about money.\n\nMost congressional Republicans are in favor of helping Ukraine. The extremists, however, warned Joe Biden last month that they would oppose additional assistance to Kyiv. The list of signatories to a September 21 letter to the Office of Management and Budget is a roster of shame, including the new America Firsters in the Senate (J. D. Vance, Rand Paul, Mike Lee, and Tommy Tuberville among them) and the grotesque caucus-within-a-caucus of some of the most unhinged and weirdest members of the House, including Clay Higgins, Harriet Hageman, Andy Biggs, Anna Paulina Luna, and that titan of probity and prudence, Paul Gosar .\n\nThe drumbeat of propaganda from these members and their \"amen\" chorus in the right-wing media is having an effect: An Economist /YouGov poll released last week found a slight uptick among all voters for reducing military aid to Ukraine, but for the first time found that a majority of Republicans now support such reductions. Fortunately, Americans overall- even many voters in the GOP -are still holding firm in their support for Ukraine in its fight against Russian imperialism.\n\nNevertheless, GOP hostility to Ukraine on the Hill and among its rank-and-file voters is growing for several reasons-none of them principled.\n\nFirst, foreign aid is always an easy hot button for the know-nothing right to push. Most Americans have no idea how much the United States spends on foreign aid, and they grossly overestimate how much goes to such programs. ( Most Americans think it's about 25 percent of the U.S. budget and want it reduced to about 10 percent. Their wish is already granted: It's actually about 1 percent.) Worse, so many years after Russia's first invasion of Ukraine (in Crimea), some two-thirds of Americans still don't even know where Ukraine is.\n\nThey also do not understand that most foreign assistance is not a cash handout: Money is spent to buy weapons, food, and other products made in America, which we then ship to other nations. Instead, many Americans think of assistance-mistakenly-as bags of untraceable money handed to foreigners to do with as they will, which is why opportunists such as Ron DeSantis (who once supported aid to Ukraine) try to exploit provocative terms such as blank check to describe helping Ukraine. DeSantis knows better; so do other Republican leaders.\n\nBut the Trumpist right has a more specific beef with Ukraine because of the role Ukraine played in Donald Trump's impeachment and eventual electoral downfall. Interestingly, Vance has tried to make the opposite argument: \"Sorry, this needs to be said,\" he tweeted on Saturday , while clearly being not sorry. \"A lot of the anti-Russia obsession on the left has nothing to do with Ukraine. It's a revenge fantasy over 2016. They blame Russia for Donald Trump's election and they'll bleed Ukraine dry for payback.\"\n\nAs is so often the case with modern Republicans, every accusation is a confession, and every assertion is projection. The majority of the country-not \"the left\"-is supporting Ukraine because it's the right thing to do, not because they hate Russia for electing Trump. Rather, it's the other way around: The MAGA Republicans are opposing Ukraine because they hate Ukraine and its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, for their role in the impeachment drama.\n\nUnlike Vance and his isolationist colleagues, most Americans recognize the immense threat that Russia's war of conquest poses to our allies, to global peace, and to the security of the United States itself. Republicans once stood at the forefront of opposition to Kremlin aggression-Ronald Reagan's steadfast opposition to Moscow was one of the reasons I was a young GOP voter in the 1980s-but now the party is saddled with a group of shortsighted appeasers, buttressed by a squad of right-wing cranks, who would doom tens of millions of innocent people to Russian President Vladimir Putin's butchery just to own the libs.\n\nAlso, we should not look away from a nauseating truth about the extremist caucus within the GOP: Some of them genuinely admire Putin and what he has created in Russia. Tucker Carlson, after all, didn't get taken off the air for supporting Putin in ways that would have made Cold War Soviet propagandists blush; he got canned after a defamation lawsuit from an election-machine company. These GOP extremists have swallowed the gargantuan lie that Putin is a godly defender of white Christian Europe against the decadent West and its legions of militant drag queens. (They believe this, in part, because they know less than nothing about conditions in Russia or its demography.)\n\nFinally, some Republicans oppose aid to Ukraine because of the more general and bizarre countercultural obsession that has seized the American right: Whatever most of their fellow citizens approve of, they must oppose, or else they risk losing their precious claims to being an embattled minority. If they were to support aid to Ukraine, how would they be different from everyone else, and especially from Biden? How would they mark their tribal loyalty if they crossed party lines to oppose a dictator-while supporting a wannabe dictator of their own?\n\nSome Republican opponents of assistance to Ukraine are merely cynical manipulators who care little about national or international security. Many genuinely admire Putin and hope for Ukraine's defeat. Others are merely ignorant. But all of them are bound together by the reflexive urge to reject whatever it is that most other Americans accept. As a commenter on social media said to me today , if liberals were opposing aiding the Ukrainian war effort, \"the GOP would shut down the government to ensure aid and you'd see Ukrainian flags waving on the back of pickups.\"\n\nTo adopt a line from Senator Vance: Sorry, but it has to be said.\n\nRelated:\n\nToday's News\n\nEvening Read\n\nTaylor Swift Is Too Famous for This\n\nBy Devin Gordon\n\nHas Taylor Swift ever been more popular, more all-powerful, more white Beyoncé than she is right now? She's in the middle of an era-defining tour that is literally called the Eras Tour. A concert-film version of the show is about to arrive in theaters nationwide-she dropped the news a few weeks ago, and within hours, Hollywood studios were scrambling to get their movies out of her way .

And now, to her vast dominion, she has added untold millions of football-loving (mostly) men, thanks to her escalating flirtations with the Kansas City Chiefs' sexy goofus tight end, Travis Kelce ...\n\nMaybe they'll fall in love.

      "text": "Conservatives Believe Trump Is Above the Law\n\nRepublicans' reflexive insistence that the Mar-a-Lago raid is politically motivated is unmoored from the available evidence.\n\nA former president's home was raided by federal law enforcement yesterday, reportedly over possession of classified documents. Although prosecution of former heads of state has occurred in other democracies, a form of government in which ostensibly no one is above the law , it has never happened in America, a place that did not even punish the leaders of a rebellion in defense of human bondage .\n\nThe merits of a potential government case against Donald Trump, and of the basis for the FBI's raid on Mar-a-Lago, cannot yet be evaluated, despite the assertions of many of Trump's supporters and critics. A federal search warrant can be obtained only with probable cause and with the approval of a federal magistrate, but that does not mean that Trump is guilty of whatever alleged crime the FBI is investigating. Nor does the fact that Trump may be guilty of criminal conduct in other contexts mean that he is guilty here. But at the same time, the reflexive Republican insistence that the investigation is politically motivated is itself unmoored from the available evidence.\n\nDavid A. Graham: The Mar-a-Lago raid proves the U.S. isn't a banana republic\n\nOn Fox News, pundits warned of a \"preemptive coup,\" proclaimed a \"dark day for the republic,\" and compared the FBI to \"the gestapo.\" Other conservative-media figures grimly suggested that political violence was imminent, while a few right-wing intellectuals tweeted menacingly in the same tone that a mid-level functionary on the Death Star uses right before he gets choked out by Darth Vader. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy announced that the FBI was in a \"an intolerable state of weaponized politicization\" and threatened to investigate if Republicans take back Congress in the midterms.\n\nAgain, the case against Trump here is impossible to evaluate, because we know the basis neither for the warrant nor the investigation. So the certainty that Trump is being politically persecuted cannot be supported by evidence. It is instead based on ideology: There are people against whom law-enforcement action or abuse is always justified, and there are people against whom it can never be justified. That is, if law-enforcement officials want to murder an unarmed Black man in the street, brutalize protesters against police misconduct, or investigate a Democratic presidential candidate, conservatives will insist that such officers are infallible and that any criticism of their conduct is outrageous . But when the law is used to investigate or restrict the conduct of people deemed by conservatives to be above its prohibitions, that is axiomatically an abuse of power.\n\nThis is why, for example, it was perfectly permissible for Trump to order his attorney general to prosecute his political opponents , to even campaign on that basis , but it is intolerable politicization for him to be investigated, regardless of the basis. Indeed, there is no need to know what the basis even is; it is by definition unjustified because of whom it targets. This reasoning is also why the police who defended the Capitol against the rioters on January 6 were assaulted by people who in any other context would chant \"Blue lives matter.\" Law enforcement is legitimate and deserving of unconditional support only as long as it enforces the law against groups conservatives want it to target and exempts those they do not. Shortly after news of the raid broke , far-right representatives such as Lauren Boebert, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Paul Gosar called for the FBI to be defunded or destroyed.\n\nDavid Frum: Stuck with Trump\n\nIronically, Trump has continually received favorable treatment from the FBI. During the 2016 election, FBI Director James Comey twice aided Trump's campaign by commenting publicly on an FBI investigation into his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, while the bureau subsequently denied to the press that the Trump campaign was being investigated for coordinating with a Russian effort to influence the election. Then, after Comey refused to reassure Trump that the president would be above the law, Trump fired him and handpicked his replacement, who is still in office today. In 2016, Trump supporters chanted \"Lock her up\" in reference to Clinton's mishandling of classified emails; today the alleged mishandling of classified information is deemed by these same supporters to be a form of political persecution. This is not because one set of facts is more damning than another; it is because conservatives believe that the law does not apply to Trump. (The centrist version of this argument is that any politician with sufficient political support becomes an unaccountable caudillo who possesses legal immunity, a position that mocks the bedrock democratic principle of political equality.)\n\nI hope that the Department of Justice and the FBI, by virtue of the seriousness of this matter, have acted as carefully as possible in obtaining their search warrant. The gravity of the situation might suggest that they would have done so, but it doesn't mean they did. Just as it cannot yet be said that Trump is a victim of political persecution, we do not yet know that the FBI's actions here are justified. In keeping with conservative ideology about the infallibility of law-enforcement officials when they are not investigating Republicans, conservative judges and justices have consistently narrowed constitutional due-process protections that exist to prevent potential abuses . Indeed, Trump himself publicly encouraged cops to physically assault those in their custody, while his administration abandoned any pretense of federal oversight of police misconduct. Ultimately, conservatives believe this unfairness in the justice system to be a virtue , as long as they are never on its losing end.\n\nThe Trump supporters outraged about the Mar-a-Lago raid are not lamenting that those protections have been curtailed. They simply believe that Trump should not be subject to the law at all. Political systems with such exemptions exist, but democracy is not one of them."

      "text": "Trump Floats the Idea of Executing Joint Chiefs Chairman Milley\n\nThe former president is inciting violence against the nation's top general. America's response is distracted and numb.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nLate Friday night, the former president of the United States-and a leading candidate to be the next president-insinuated that America's top general deserves to be put to death.\n\nThat extraordinary sentence would be unthinkable in any other rich democracy. But Donald Trump, on his social-media network, Truth Social, wrote that Mark Milley's phone call to reassure China in the aftermath of the storming of the Capitol on January 6, 2021, was \"an act so egregious that, in times gone by, the punishment would have been DEATH.\" (The phone call was, in fact, explicitly authorized by Trump-administration officials.) Trump's threats against Milley came after The Atlantic 's publication of a profile of Milley , by this magazine's editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg, who detailed the ways in which Milley attempted to protect the Constitution from Trump.\n\nAnd yet, none of the nation's front pages blared \"Trump Suggests That Top General Deserves Execution\" or \"Former President Accuses General of Treason.\" Instead, the post barely made the news. Most Americans who don't follow Trump on social media probably don't even know it happened.\n\nTrump's rhetoric is dangerous, not just because it is the exact sort that incites violence against public officials but also because it shows just how numb the country has grown toward threats more typical of broken, authoritarian regimes. The United States is not just careening toward a significant risk of political violence around the 2024 presidential election. It's also mostly oblivious to where it's headed.\n\nTrump loves to hide behind the thin veneer of plausible deniability, but he knows exactly what he's doing. If a mob boss were to say, \"In times gone by, people like you would have had their legs broken,\" nobody would mistake that for a historical observation. The suggestion is clear, and it comes from a man who has one of America's loudest megaphones-one that is directed squarely at millions of extremists who are well armed, who insist that the government is illegitimate, and who believe that people like Milley are part of a \"deep state\" plot against the country.\n\nAcademics have a formal term for exactly this type of incitement: stochastic terrorism . An influential figure with a large following demonizes a person or a group of people. The likelihood is strong that some small number of followers will take those words literally-when Trump implies that Milley deserves to be put to death, some of his disciples might take it as a marching order. The number of those who take action does not have to be large for the result to be horrific.\n\nAlready, one of Trump's minions in Congress has echoed the incitement to violence. The Republican Paul Gosar of Arizona wrote-in his taxpayer-funded newsletter , no less-that \"in a better society, quislings like the strange sodomy-promoting General Milley would be hung.\" The meaning is not ambiguous: Gosar is explicitly saying that killing Milley would be desirable.\n\nFrom the November 2023 Issue: The Patriot\n\nAs a political scientist who studies political violence across the globe, I would chalk up the lack of high-profile assassinations in the United States during the Trump and post-Trump era to dumb luck. Already in 2018, one deranged Trump follower, Cesar Sayoc, sent pipe bombs to public figures (and a media organization) who just so happened to be among those whom Trump most often attacked in his Twitter feed. Thankfully, nobody died-not because the dangers of Trump's rhetoric were overstated but because Sayoc was bad at building bombs.\n\nHeading toward one of the most consequential, divisive elections in American history, every ingredient in the deadly recipe for political violence is already in the mix: high-stakes, winner-take-all politics; widespread conspiratorial delusions that detach followers from objective realities; a suggestion that one's political opponents aren't \"real Americans\"; a large supply of violent extremists with easy access to deadly weaponry; and a movement whose leader takes every opportunity to praise those who have already participated in a deadly attack on the government.\n\nEventually, all luck runs out. Political violence is notoriously difficult to forecast with precision, but would anyone really be surprised if Trump's violent rhetoric led to real-world attacks in the run-up to the 2024 election-or in its aftermath, if he loses?\n\nFor all of these reasons, Trump's recent unhinged rant about Milley should be a wake-up call. But in today's political climate, the incident barely registers. Trump scandals have become predictably banal. And American journalists have become golden retrievers watching a tennis-ball launcher. Every time they start to chase one ball, a fresh one immediately explodes into view, prompting a new chase.\n\nEventually, chasing tennis balls gets old. We become more alive to virtually any distraction: The media fixate on John Fetterman's hoodie instead of on stories about the relentless but predictable risk of Trump-inspired political violence.\n\nBombarded by a constant stream of deranged authoritarian extremism from a man who might soon return to the presidency, we've lost all sense of scale and perspective. But neither the American press nor the public can afford to be lulled. The man who, as president, incited a violent attack on the U.S. Capitol in order to overturn an election is again openly fomenting political violence while explicitly endorsing authoritarian strategies should he return to power. That is the story of the 2024 election. Everything else is just window dressing."

      "text": "The Dawn of the Intra-Family Political Attack Ad\n\nThe trend reveals how partisan schisms in the Trump era are dividing families.\n\nLike many Americans, David Glosser has a lot of opinions about politics. When I spoke with him on the phone, he paused his diatribe against the Trump administration only to cough. But unlike most Americans, Glosser-a retired physician who lives in Yardley, Pennsylvania, which hugs the state's border with New Jersey-is closely related to one of President Donald Trump's most influential aides. His nephew is Stephen Miller, the White House senior policy adviser known for his hawkish views on immigration , who is helping craft the policies that his uncle so detests.\n\nIn August, Glosser published an essay in Politico magazine chiding his nephew by sharing the family's own immigration story as Jews who fled the shtetls of Eastern Europe. \"I have watched with dismay and increasing horror as my nephew,\" Glosser wrote, \"an educated man who is well aware of his heritage, has become the architect of immigration policies that repudiate the very foundation of our family's life in this country.\"\n\nRead: Stephen Miller is Trump's right-hand troll\n\nAhead of the midterm elections, a shocking number of political figures' family members have taken the severe step of publicly rebuking their kin. Most notably, in September, six siblings of Representative Paul Gosar-a Trump acolyte who represents a vast swath of western Arizona- renounced their brother in a television ad for his opponent. Then, in late October, 12 relatives of the Republican gubernatorial candidate in Nevada, Adam Laxalt, wrote an op-ed opposing his candidacy. The brother of Randy Bryce, a Democrat running to fill the House seat that Paul Ryan is vacating in Wisconsin, also attacked his candidacy in a TV ad. And the parents of the erstwhile GOP Senate candidate in Minnesota, Kevin Nicholson, who lost in the Republican primary in August, maxed out on donations to his Democratic opponent. (A spokesman for Adam Laxalt, the only candidate mentioned in this story who returned a request for comment, referred me to another op-ed in response-this one co-authored by 22 of Laxalt's relatives who support his candidacy.)\n\nFamily feuds over politics are surely as old as politics itself. Strained relationships between relatives with different views can affect private family gatherings, especially during election season: By one measure , political disagreements cut Thanksgiving dinners short by a collective 34 million hours in 2016. Still, the recent spate of people publicly excoriating their politician family members appears to be a new phenomenon altogether. And it seems to reveal something about how families are dealing with the country's d eepening partisan schisms in the Trump era. \"This probably couldn't have occurred in 1985,\" says Kent Tedin, a University of Houston political scientist who studies how politics affects families. \"This could only have happened in 2016 or after.\"\n\nSurely, many political candidates have a disapproving relative or two who stay silent behind gritted teeth, or who argue with them behind closed doors. But to publicly denounce a relative, someone must feel that the stakes are so high that speaking up is worth the cost of tattered family ties. \"These people feel strongly that the politics is really consequential,\" says the UC Berkeley political scientist Laura Stoker. \"They feel really strongly that [their relative] is making a terrible mistake.\"\n\nRead: The 2018 midterms might kill the American moderate for good\n\nDemocrats, as members of the party out of power, seem to be feeling those stakes more acutely. Egged on by discontent with Trump's presidency, Democrats are poised to turn out in higher numbers than in any other midterm election in at least a decade, according to reporting by The New York Times . A record number of Democrats ran for Congress this year as well: In one congressional district in rural Virginia, no Democrat had staged a campaign in 20 years. This year, four people ran in the Democratic primary. It's no coincidence, then, that this micro-trend is being driven mostly by disapproving family members of Republican candidates: Of the five examples of this phenomenon that I could find, just one involved an attack on a Democratic candidate.\n\nIndeed, that feeling of discontent is what spurred David Gosar to join five of his siblings in a viral TV ad eviscerating their Republican congressman brother. \"He's been a congressman for eight years,\" Gosar told me. \"For seven of those years, we kept quiet, but he kept pushing it and pushing it.\" The breaking point came, David said, when the representative, in an interview with Vice , appeared to suggest that the liberal billionaire philanthropist George Soros was behind the violent protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, last year-a popular right-wing conspiracy theory. \"That was just it-it broke the camel's back,\" Gosar said. \"This has everything to do with him being a cruel, hateful person to others.\"\n\nDavid Glosser, Stephen Miller's uncle, told me that the Trump administration's short-lived practice of separating asylum-seeking parents from their kids prompted his essay. \"When I saw the images, I was horrified,\" he said. \"That's what finally pushed me over the edge to go to a broader public.\"\n\nThese public family feuds are even more notable because most of the time these days, families share their politics. In fact, people often figure out their political views through their families; especially in the early years of kids' lives, parents are the most important factor that shapes their affiliations, according to Stoker. \"It's a process that's tied to social approval,\" she says. \"Kids want to be similar to their parents. It produces better relationships.\" Yet as the country has become more politically polarized, families are becoming even more homogenous than before: According to one study , 82 percent of spouses share the same partisan affiliation, and 74 percent of kids share their parents' views, up from 68.6 percent in 1965. Even more astonishingly, researchers found that in 1960, just 4 percent of parents were upset by the prospect of their child marrying someone from the other party-but by 2010, that figure had jumped to one-third of Democrats and one-half of Republicans.\n\nRead: Do children just take their parents' political beliefs?\n\n\"The general experience is that families in the polarized era have built a fortress around themselves and that they're all on the same page,\" Tedin says. \"People really want to keep domestic harmony in the family.\" While it has become less common for families to diverge politically, \"if you ultimately come to disagree, it really frays family relationships,\" Tedin adds. \"There's solidarity in the family, and if you're on the wrong side of that, it becomes a lot more important.\" Today, when family members disagree politically, they may be less likely than they were in earlier eras to put the discord past them to maintain their relationship.\n\nIndeed, David Gosar is quick to tell me that his falling-out with his brother has everything to do with his brother's political views: They were close as kids, and rarely talked about politics until 2010, when Paul Gosar first ran for Congress. \"We have a nonexistent relationship,\" David Gosar told me. \"I don't want anything to do with him. The last time I saw him was two and a half years ago when I went to [his daughter's] wedding with the explicit condition that he wasn't to talk to me or approach me.\"\n\nKevin Marie Laxalt told me she hasn't cut off all ties with her nephew Adam, the Republican candidate for governor in Nevada, even after she co-authored a recent op-ed in the Reno Gazette-Journal criticizing him. But she says that his political views have led them to grow apart. \"To see his entitlement to governing Nevada created a clash between us all,\" she says. \"Had there been a spirit of building bridges on his part, this would not have been an issue.\"\n\nSince publishing his essay, Glosser says he has avoided talking to his famous nephew, and has exchanged only a stray email or two with Miller's mother, his sister. \"For the sake of family peacefulness,\" Glosser says, \"it would have been easier for me to do nothing and to just keep it to myself.\"\n\nWhatever the results of the midterms, it's nearly unimaginable that the country's partisan divide could be healed by 2020, when Donald Trump will be up for reelection. And now that a precedent has been set by these intra-family attack ads, when the next election heats up, it's reasonable to think that others may try that tactic.\n\nBut the embattled politicians themselves are starting to cobble together a playbook on how to respond to the criticism. Most have opted for silence or relatively anodyne statements, perhaps hoping to preserve any lingering family ties, or perhaps suspecting that airing their family's dirty laundry wouldn't improve their image. But Representative Paul Gosar jumped right in to the family feud. \"To the six angry Democrat Gosars,\" he tweeted , \"see you at Mom and Dad's house!\""

      "text": "The GOP Goes Down the Rabbit Hole\n\nWelcome to the Republican Wonderland.\n\nThis is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here .\n\nIf you were hoping that a razor-thin majority in the House was going to moderate the behavior of congressional Republicans and create some sort of platform for governing, you are about to be disappointed. GOP House leaders have told us what to expect, and we should take them at their word.\n\nBut first, here are three new stories from The Atlantic .\n\nAlthough 2022 was, overall, a good year for democracy, I did warn back in late November that the authoritarian right was regrouping and that there would be challenges ahead in 2023. And here we are: Brazil has now endured its own version of a January 6 insurrection (the rioters were even egged on by American seditionists ); Russia's Vladimir Putin and his obedient poodle, the Belarus dictator Alexander Lukashenko, are conducting joint military drills near Ukraine, according to Belarusian state TV; and the Republicans have, after 15 rounds of voting and a possible shady deal with its crackpot caucus, taken control of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nThere are some on the center-right who are hoping that the GOP has learned its lesson, and will restrain its fringe and finally leave Donald Trump behind. Ross Douthat , for one, wrote over the weekend-in a column that was hopeful to the point of fantasy-that the fight over the House speakership was \"the old world come again,\" a return to \"the G.O.P. ancien regime with all its dysfunctions, stalemates and futility,\" and that Trump, although \"hardly finished,\" has lost much of his grip on the party.\n\nGood luck with all of that. A more authoritative voice, the new House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, also had a few things to say. The new House Republican majority, he tweeted on Sunday afternoon, would move in its first week to pass legislation to defund \"the 87,000 new IRS agents,\" establish a committee on the \"weaponization of the federal government against citizens,\" end Strategic Petroleum Reserve oil sales to China, and, in a nice flourish, hold \"woke prosecutors accountable.\"\n\nThe new House Judiciary chair, Jim Jordan, will lead the committee on \"weaponization,\" virtually guaranteeing that its hearings will turn into a festival of prancing nonsense that is unlikely to do very much but enhance Jordan's visibility while he tears into U.S. intelligence and law-enforcement agencies at the expense of American national security. (Jordan has also dropped unsubtle hints that he intends to impeach Joe Biden.)\n\nMeanwhile, Jordan's fellow leader in the Coalition of the Unhinged, Paul Gosar, also tweeted on Saturday that Republicans \"will conduct a real investigation into J6. The effort to attempt a coup between traitor Gen. Mark Milley and [Nancy] Pelosi will be reviewed and exposed.\" This, apparently, is a reference to when Pelosi, as speaker, called Milley , the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, two days after January 6 because she was concerned that Trump might try to start a war as a diversion from his election loss. (She wasn't alone: Trump's secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, among others , reportedly had the same concern. So did I .)\n\nI doubt that most Republicans in Congress actually believe that the most senior military officer in the United States is a traitor. And yet, they all remain quiet-because under the GOP's rules, any one member can move to vacate the speaker's chair and start the whole leadership fiasco all over again, and that includes Gosar, the dentist from Arizona turned conspiracy-obsessed crank who now sits in the People's House.\n\nBut Gosar's gibbering raises the larger question of what else McCarthy might have agreed to while he was slicing up his political soul like a pound of cheap olive loaf. We're in the dark-and so are many members of Congress, apparently. Punchbowl is reporting that the rules package , the first order of business about how the House will run, contains a secret three-page addendum-some sort of deal between McCarthy and his fellow Republicans that the rest of the members have not seen.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump is taking credit for getting McCarthy the speaker's job. And rightly so: McCarthy himself is thanking Trump. The former president, according to Politico , did not insert himself in the struggle in the House at the last minute; rather, some of the Republicans called him , and when he spoke with the recalcitrant legislators, in this account, he \"tore them a new asshole\" over their opposition to McCarthy. Shortly thereafter, one of the holdouts, Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona, changed his vote to \"present,\" which lowered the number of votes McCarthy needed to win. Matt Gaetz-who in any rational Congress would be a man of no account-therefore was able to stand firm by continuing to vote \"present\" and thus handing the gavel to McCarthy with a minority of the votes cast by the entire House.\n\nOf course, the Senate and the White House remain in the hands of Democrats. This fact could make the House GOP even more prone to performative nuttery, because most members know that most of the time, indulging the fringe is unlikely to have real-world legislative consequences. If Biden continues true to his political form, he'll likely ignore most of what goes on in the House. Biden is 80 years old; his political career spans a half century of American history, and the antics of the extremists will probably remain in his peripheral vision, if he notices them at all. (The exception here is Jordan, who has made noise about going after Biden's son Hunter. But even if those hearings take place, they are unlikely to have any major impact on policy over the next few years.)\n\nThe good news is that most of the U.S. government remains in the hands of functional adults. The bad news is that the House is headed down the rabbit hole to its own Wonderland, where things will become \"curiouser and curiouser,\" and its members will have to placate their extremists by believing \"six impossible things before breakfast\" every day.\n\nRelated :\n\nExplore all of our newsletters here.\n\nWhat Squirrels Taught Me About Life After Divorce\n\nBy Kelly McMasters\n\nNoah likes to feed the squirrels naked. I don't know if he does it this way when I am not here. But like clockwork on the weekend mornings we spend together, the squirrels will start to tap on the window. And Noah will rise from the bed as if responding to a baby monitor. He will stumble to the kitchen, grab a handful of unsalted almonds from a jar in the cabinet, return to the bedroom, and crack the window an inch, popping the almonds out one by one so they land on the sill in a line.\n\nThe squirrels live in the saw-whet owl nesting house he bought and placed on the corner of his fire escape. For a few hours each morning, they pad back and forth across the windowsill, balancing on the black steel ribbons of the landing, waiting for him to put out breakfast, then second breakfast, then snack. If no almonds are waiting for them on the sill, the squirrels will knock loudly on the window until he wakes up.\n\nRead the full article.\n\nMore From The Atlantic\n\nRead. \" For the Child(ren) I Cannot Carry ,\" a new poem by Cynthia Dewi Oka.\n\n\"I want you to know that there were moments staying / was easy.

We recently started binge-watching The Newsroom , Aaron Sorkin's HBO series about the workings of a fictional cable-news organization and the (mostly) noble people who work there. The show, which ran from 2012 to 2014, is uneven but often compelling television, though maybe I'm biased because I very much like Jeff Daniels (who plays the chief anchor, Will McAvoy) and Sam Waterston (the network president, Charlie Skinner). But like Sorkin's masterpiece, The West Wing , it is full of implausible and showy moments where each character periodically stops to deliver a long speech by ... well, by Aaron Sorkin.\n\nI don't know how true to life The Newsroom is; I've never worked in one. (Matthew Yglesias wrote earlier today of his admiration for The West Wing as a show that reflects some realities in Washington; I think he is wrong. That show is Veep .) But there is an unsettling prescience to The Newsroom -which took many of its plots from actual events almost in real time-about politics and news and entertainment, and how all of them became indistinguishable in a country that doesn't care about reality or government or decency or much of anything else. The Newsroom ended its run just as the GOP won full control of Congress, and two years before Trump arrived at the White House-events I suspect would have challenged even Sorkin's creative powers.\n\n- Tom\n\nIsabel Fattal contributed to this newsletter."

      "text": "Rep. Gosar's Homophobic Sunday Rant Is Deranged-Even for Him\n\nMedia Reporter\n\nRep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) used his weekly email newsletter-hosted on a .gov domain that is funded by American taxpayers-on Sunday to launch a thinly veiled, homophobic attack on Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley, shockingly suggesting Milley should be put to death.\n\nThe diatribe came in a section commenting on former Capitol Police Chief Stephen Sund's testimony to the House Committee on Administration last week, in which Sund discussed the Capitol riot. Sund called the events of Jan. 6 \"an intelligence failure\" and said he wished several agencies and individuals-from the Pentagon to then-President Donald Trump-had reacted more swiftly to provide back-up for local law enforcement.\n\nBut in Gosar's recantation of the day's events, Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) remained the villain of the riots, though it was Milley-\"the homosexual-promoting-BLM-activist Chairman of the military joint chiefs\"-who delayed the deployment of the National Guard, Gosar claimed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Of course, we now know that the deviant Milley was coordinating with Nancy Pelosi to hurt President Trump, and treasonously working behind Trump's back,\" Gosar wrote in a screed far-removed from the truth. \"In a better society, quislings like the strange sodomy-promoting General Milley would be hung.\"\n\nGosar also accused Milley of being a \"traitor\" who coordinated with the Chinese military and actively worked against Trump. The attacks echo what Trump himself seemed to wish upon Milley, writing in a Truth Social post on Friday that \"in times gone by, the punishment would have been DEATH!\"\n\nMilley made two calls to a Chinese general both before and after the 2020 election to defuse tensions between the two nations after China received intelligence that Trump would attack the country. He later told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the calls, which Trump has previously labeled treasonous, were an effort to \"deconflict military actions, manage crisis, and prevent war between great powers that are armed with the world's most deadliest weapons.\"\n\nGosar, who reportedly sought a preemptive pardon for his role in promoting Trump's election lies in the lead-up to the riot, has spread numerous deluded-and somewhat contradictory-claims about Jan. 6 ever since, including blaming the riot on antifa and calling rioters merely \"peaceful patriots.\"\n\nEven his own siblings said in a 2021 ad that aired on Fox News , \"There is no one member of Congress more responsible for the attack on the Capitol than Congressman Paul Gosar.\"\n\nGosar, who has extensive links to white nationalists and Capitol rioters, has turned his ire on Milley in the past. He promised in January to launch an investigation into \"the effort to attempt a coup between traitor Gen. Mark Milley and [then-House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi.\"\n\nHe was also the first House member to be censured in a decade in 2021 after he tweeted an anime clip of himself murdering Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).\n\nMedia Reporter\n\ncorbin.bolies@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

The news was first reported by Politico, which said the subpoenas do not indicate that Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes is necessarily mulling criminal charges against either Biggs or Gosar. However, according to the outlet, the move by Mayes, who is reportedly close to making a decision on whether or not to indict, suggests investigators have \"cast a far wider net... than previously understood.\" The Jan. 6 committee found that both Biggs and Gosar attended a White House meeting with Trump on Dec. 21, 2020, to strategize on ways that then-Vice President Mike Pence could block the certification of the election results.

And 2) \"Who on Gosar's staff is the meme Lord ?\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Gosar has waded into the country's culture wars via crappy video editing software; he previously circulated a bespoke meme praising white nationalists . Now, he's frothing over bloody cartoons involving Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the whole thing, \"it's cringe.\" As host Will Sommer notes, \"Not a good sign for the state of the country, or the right, to be tweeting your anime assassination fantasies.\"\n\nSpeaking of fantasies, James O'Keefe of Project Veritas, er, fame has tried to turbocharge his outfit from \"rinky-dink schemes into playing spy\" and it's seemingly landed him in hot water with the FBI. The feds raided three locations associated with O'Keefe and Project Veritas in connection with Ashley Biden's stolen diary, which was posted online by a right-wing reporter. Apparently Ashley Biden's house had been burglarized during the election, so, as Sommer notes, \"one starts to wonder, you know, how did this diary get out there?\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSeparately, O'Keefe and his cohorts are facing another lawsuit in court, this time involving a Project Veritas crony who went undercover posing as an intern at a left-wing outfit. Now they're getting sued.\n\n\"O'Keefe is on the witness list, a lot of various Project Veritas people are, I think it could get pretty interesting in what it uncovers about the way Project Veritas operates,\" Sommer says.  \"For a young man who once dressed up as a pimp and tried to lure a cable news reporter onto a boat filled with sex toys, things have gotten pretty crazy.\"\n\nDo Gen Z and Astrology TikTok really believe Travis Scott is the Devil? The rapper, whose Astroworld concert turned into tragedy when an excited crowd crushed eight fans to death , has been at the center of a torrent of Satanic panic conspiracies theories on the video-sharing platform. \"One TikTok that I saw yesterday had only been online for a day. He received a million views in a day claiming that the stage was a portal into literal hell. So this is the narrative now circulating around this tragedy,\" relates host Kelly Weill.\n\nThe Satanism conspiracy theory has really taken off on social media, and not just among the usual QAnon crowd-younger users are also getting in on the action. \"You're seeing these weird shades of conspiracy theories-there's a softer, leftier tinge to all of these. I'm seeing people with, like, anime avatars using astrology to argue this was a Satanic ritual,\" Weill notes. \"There is sort of a soft spiritualism, I think, among certain Gen Z and millennial cohorts... I think that these audiences are a little bit more receptive to moral panics than older folks might realize.\"\n\nDid someone say \"moral panic\"? Enter Tucker Carlson's \"documentary\" for Fox Nation on Jan. 6 trutherism, called Patriot Purge . The Fox News host throws in a lot of implications that the attack on the Capitol was a \"false flag\" by the deep state-\"that not only was the FBI likely involved in setting this up, but that ... it's targeting millions of Americans to become political prisoners in gulags,\" says Daily Beast reporter and three-eyed raven of cable news, Justin Baragona.\n\nThe film-which is, not surprisingly, filled with falsehoods-promotes Carlson's belief that \"the violence was just a couple people knocking stuff over in the Capitol anyway\" and that the riot, which left a Capitol Police officer dead, \"was nothing more than a political protest that got a little out of hand.\"\n\nCarlson's core argument, Baragona says, \"is that January 6th not only was not an insurrection but is basically being used as the impetus for a War on Terror 2.0, which is targeting what he calls 'legacy Americans' over their political beliefs.\"\n\nIf you think that's a racist dog whistle, Tucker Carlson would say you're wrong, but of course that sort of coded language has been used by white supremacists in the past.\n\nCarlson ends the film, Baragona notes, with a chilling, not-so-thinly-veiled threat that \"if you continue to keep prosecuting those involved with January 6th, we're going to see more and more violence...There's going to be more violence from these 'legacy Americans', if you keep pushing.\"\n\nFinally, remember those crowds of QAnon fans flocking to Dallas to see JFK Jr. return to life, only to be deeply disappointed? Well...\n\n\"The QAnon people have stuck around Dallas. They aren't leaving the big D despite the disappointment,\" Sommer reveals. \"Even a few days later, they were forming Q's in the grass outside of Dealey Plaza, still dozens of them there.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the failed appearance of JFK Jr. and his pops has driven a schism among the faithful. Some are doubling down on the prophecy. Others are some calling foul. \"QAnon John, who runs all these QAnon conventions-and literally a few weeks ago held an event where not one, but two JFK Jr. impersonators appeared-is now saying the JFK Jr. Movement is madness and it needs to stop,\" Sommer notes.\n\n\"So people are turning on the JFK crew.\"\n\nListen, and subscribe, to Fever Dreams on Apple Podcasts , Spotify , and Stitcher .\n\nGot a tip?

Paul Gosar (R-AZ) appears to be relishing the backlash over his decision to share a violent murder fantasy on Twitter even after the move got him formally censured by the House .\n\nJust hours after he was stripped of all committee assignments on Wednesday, the Arizona Republican took to Gettr to share a meme boasting that he'd gained some kind of \"thug life\" cred. The \"Gosar Life\" meme featured a photo of the lawmaker with dark sunglasses and an oversize gold chain superimposed over him-along with a supposed joint sticking out of his mouth.\n\nHe captioned the meme \"can't keep me down\" and in an accompanying video accused Democrats of attempting to \"take away my America First agenda.\" It was not immediately clear what the \"America First agenda\" had to do with the anime video he shared that depicted him murdering Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe has refused to apologize for sharing the video and blamed his own staff for posting the violent clip, which he claimed was an innocent depiction of a \"policy battle.\"\n\nHe then retweeted the video late Wednesday, even as his own family condemned him for it-with his brother calling for his expulsion and even suggesting criminal charges.\n\n\"I believe he's dangerous, unhinged, and is reckless,\" Tim Gosar told MSNBC in the wake of the House censure. \"And is somebody that, as I've said before, needs to not only be censured but he needs to be expelled.\"\n\nHe said criminal charges should be brought if authorities deem them to be warranted.\n\n\"To be honest with you, it is about time,\" Jennifer Gosar told MSNBC, calling the anime video shared by her brother \"sinister\" and \"bone-chilling.\"\n\nShe said the video marked an \"escalation\" in the lawmaker's incendiary antics, noting that \"this is not the first time my brother has threatened the life of representatives.\"\n\nSeveral of Paul Gosar's siblings have spoken out against him in recent years as he has gone further and further off the rails. Just a month after inciting Trump supporters ahead of the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot and reportedly offering a \"blanket pardon\" to Stop the Steal organizers, Gosar spoke at a far-right, white-nationalist convention .\n\nHe was accused directly of orchestrating the attempted Capitol insurrection by three of his siblings, including Jennifer and Tim Gosar, in a video aired on Fox News this year that called for \"criminal consequences.\"\n\nPaul Gosar reposted this meme of himself on GETTR just now. pic.twitter.com/mWUKIXsQXh\n\nNews Editor\n\nGot a tip?

In an MSNBC appearance several hours later, Ocasio-Cortez emphasized the \"unprecedented\" nature of the situation, saying, \"It's about the cards that are in McCarthy's hands.

Paul Gosar (R-AZ) baselessly accused antifa protesters of being behind the insurrection. But, according to an exclusive report from Rolling Stone , Gosar knew exactly who was to blame-and even offered them a pardon ahead of the events of Jan. 6. An unnamed organizer of the Stop the Steal rally that preceded the riot told the magazine that Gosar offered planners a \"blanket pardon\" in an unrelated investigation to incentivize them to organize the pro-Trump protests on Jan. 6. \"Our impression was that it was a done deal... that he'd spoken to the president about it in the Oval ... in a meeting about pardons and that our names came up,\" said the organizer. The source claimed Gosar told them: \"I was just going over the list of pardons and we just wanted to tell you guys how much we appreciate all the hard work you've been doing.\" Rolling Stone also reports that at least three rally organizers are cooperating with the House panel probing the riot, and have alleged several members of Congress were \"intimately involved\" in the plans.\n\nNews Correspondent\n\nGot a tip?

Paul Gosar (R-AZ) got there this week after the House formally censured him for tweeting murder anime that targeted his colleague Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).\n\nWhile President Joe Biden signed the bipartisan infrastructure bill into law this week, Meyers explained that \"Republicans spent their Wednesday defending one of their most unhinged members.\" In his own defense, Gosar said that if he has to follow in the footsteps of Alexander Hamilton, who was the first member of Congress to face a censure vote, \"then so be it, it is done.\"\n\n\"I love when these idiots try to sound smart and adopt a defiant tone by using dramatic language like 'so be it, it is done,'\" Meyers replied. \"You don't sound like a Founding Father, you sound like Cousin Greg.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd to Republicans \"complaining that this is a waste of time,\" the Late Night host said, \"This whole thing would have been much easier and taken up much less time if you'd just been willing to step forward and say it was a deeply stupid tweet.

The digital director for right-wing Arizona Congressmember Paul Gosar has been revealed as a prominent follower of neo-Nazi online influencer Nick Fuentes. Gosar himself is linked to organizers of the January 6 insurrection and was censured for posting an animated video on social media where he murdered Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacked President Biden. We speak with Talking Points Memo reporter Hunter Walker about his exclusive report, which he says \"removes that veil of plausible deniability\" from Gosar about his office's ties to extremists.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman, as we look now at the newly confirmed direct connection between a white supremacist leader and the digital director for one of Trump's staunchest supporters in Congress.\n\nWe're joined in New York by Hunter Walker, an investigative reporter at Talking Points Memo , where his exclusive new story is headlined \"Capitol Hill Staffer Is A Prominent Follower Of Neo-Nazi Nick Fuentes.\"\n\nFuentes is a far-right leader who rose under Trump. The staffer who was revealed in the piece works for far-right Arizona Congressman Paul Gosar, who's linked to organizers of the deadly January 6 insurrection and was censured for posting an animated video on social media where he murders Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacks President Biden. That's the congressman, Gosar. Gosar also spoke at the openly racist America First conference, organized by Nick Fuentes to compete with the Conservative Political Action Conference, known as CPAC . This new story reveals Gosar's ties to the white supremacist movement go even deeper.\n\nHunter Walker, if you can lay out what you found about his digital director?\n\nHUNTER WALKER : Well, Amy, great to see you, first off.\n\nAnd as you pointed out, Paul Gosar already has been linked directly and personally to Nick Fuentes. But his relationship with this neo-Nazi leader has been one of alternately embracing him and distancing himself from him. As you alluded to, Paul Gosar has appeared at two editions of Nick Fuentes's America First Political Action Conference, once in person, once by video. But after that second one caused a backlash, Gosar said, you know, \"Nick has a problem with his mouth,\" and sort of attempted to disavow him somewhat. So, he's operated with a bit of plausible deniability as he's repeatedly been tied to extremist activity, including, you know, having antisemitic websites appearing in his official newsletter. And I think this story, one of the key things about it is it really removes that veil of plausible deniability for Paul Gosar.\n\nAnd what I found is that, you know, this staffer in his office, Wade Searle, evidence appears to link him to this sort of digital persona, \"Chikkenright,\" this network of interlinked social media accounts, that has put out extremist content, including statements, you know, referring to Jews as, quote-unquote, \"hook-nosed bankers,\" disparaging Asians, minimizing slavery. And also, in addition to just being a social media account, this, quote-unquote, \"Chikken\" persona was a leading figure in Nick Fuentes's organization. And we know that because of accusations from defectors from Fuentes's inner circle, who released internal chats showing this \"Chikken\" person participating in the leadership conversations, telling them about what was going on in Gosar's office. And then, also, he's a moderator on Nick Fuentes's regular stream.\n\nSo, you know, this guy has been linked to being a prominent follower of Nick Fuentes, who is an outright neo-Nazi, and the evidence is extensive. These accounts posted pictures that appear to show Wade Searle with Fuentes. It was identified as coming from Searle's hometown, being the same age as Searle. And at its inception, this \"Chikkenright\" account was credited to, quote-unquote, \"Wade\" and another person, quote-unquote, \"Landen,\" who we believe appears to be Landen Peterson, an intern in Gosar's office. So there are multiple people in the congressman's office linked to this incredibly extremist online activity and Nick Fuentes's \"Groyper\" movement.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And explain more, Hunter Walker, how you know \"Chikken\" and \"Chikkenright\" - C-H-I-K-K-E-N - how you directly linked him - because this is a very serious allegation - to Paul Gosar's office, to his staffer, Wade Searle.\n\nHUNTER WALKER : Well, first off, there's no question he works in Paul Gosar's office. You know, we looked at the disclosures. And one thing that's extremely -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Right, but how Wade Searle is \"Chikken\" or \"Chikkenright\"?\n\nHUNTER WALKER : Totally. But one thing that's extremely interesting about that, that I just want to touch on first, is, you know, there was that extreme video about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. And it was based on an anime, Attack on Titan , with sort of Gosar and Ocasio-Cortez's heads superimposed on the characters of this extremely violent Japanese animation. And anime is a persistent feature of the far right. So, that video is kind of an example of how Paul Gosar's social media has already borrowed from these far-right extremist circles. And he actually hired Wade Searle one day, officially, after being censured for that video. So, even despite getting slaps on the wrist from his fellow Republicans in Congress, Gosar has repeatedly, you know, on his official accounts, sort of winked and nodded at the far right, even as he supposedly disavowed him.\n\nWhat we found with Wade Searle, you know, is just so many links. I mean, first off, Gosar joined Gab, the extremist social media site, right after Searle joined his office. At that point, he started reposting content from \"Chikkenright.\" \"Chikkenright\" was reposting content from Gosar. At points on the \"Chikkenright\" accounts - and they're all linked. I mean, there's a Twitter, a Telegram and a Gab, sort of an overall presence that all has these internal links promoting itself, an Instagram page that was credited to, quote-unquote, \"Wade\" and, quote-unquote, \"Landen.\" And all of these interlinked accounts promoted extremist content, promoted Gosar, talked about insider knowledge of Arizona Republicans.\n\nAnd then, you know, the two most dramatic moments came as Wade Searle took his activism beyond social media. And Searle appeared to join Fuentes at a 2020 Stop the Steal rally. In addition to being a neo-Nazi, Fuentes was a big election denier whose followers had a major presence at January 6th. And you can see a man who appears to be Searle standing behind Fuentes at one of these rallies in Phoenix, Arizona, where he called Trump's loss a, quote-unquote, \"fraud.\" And, you know, photos of that man were posted on the various \"Chikkenright\" social media pages, as well as Wade Searle's more public named social media. So, he posted his own photos. You know, various things in the content, such as his hometown, the credit in the bio, seem to link him to this activity. And then, most importantly, you have these defectors from Fuentes's organization, a man named Simon Dickerman, who has named Wade Searle as \"Chikkenright.\"\n\nThis was sort of an open secret on the far right. I came across it, and then I joined with two researchers, Haley Orion of Arizona Right Wing Watch and Nick Martin of The Informant , and we pooled all of the information we had found, and, you know, it just really appears to definitively show that Wade Searle was behind these accounts. But, you know, he has been previously named by his own colleagues on the far right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And so, what has been Gosar's response to your investigation?\n\nHUNTER WALKER : Not much. You know, yesterday, the only thing I noticed from Gosar is that he shut off comments on his tweets. He blocked replies. And I think that's a really, really important thing here. You know, I noted before that he was censured for this extreme video about Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez. Since then, he's actually been brought back onto committees, after having them stripped from him, including the extremely powerful Oversight Committee. Not only did we reach out to Gosar to give him an opportunity to comment and reject this in any way or to say that he didn't know that this was happening, but we reached out to Speaker McCarthy, and he has offered no response whatsoever. And Democrats have offered very limited response, from what we've seen.\n\nAnd one of the reactions I'm noticing is, just because of Paul Gosar's extensive history, you know, winking and nodding at the far right, speaking at Fuentes's events, people have said they're not surprised. And, you know, I would just note that you were talking earlier about the alarming rise in white supremacy in this country, in white supremacist organizations. Getting an inroad on a Capitol Hill staff is a major, major turning point in that movement. It's a major bit of growth for them. And if we start to reach a point where we say we're not surprised by this, where we say, you know, we expect this in Congress, then we're allowing it to become normal. And I personally find this shocking, and I think we should remain shocked by it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Hunter Walker, we want to thank you for being with us, investigative reporter at Talking Points Memo . We'll link to your exclusive new report , \"Capitol Hill Staffer Is A Prominent Follower Of Neo-Nazi Nick Fuentes.\"\n\nOh, by the way, in other news from Capitol Hill, a man armed with a metal baseball bat attacked two staffers at Democratic Congressman Gerry Connolly's district office in Virginia Monday. The man arrived at the office, reportedly said, \"Where is Connolly?\" It's unclear what motivated the attack. A young woman who was an intern at the office on her first day of work, he beat her with the baseball bat, as well as a senior staffer. He slammed him in the head. They were hospitalized. They are out from the hospital now.\n\nNext up, an update from human rights advocates just back from the U.S.-Mexico border as the Trump-era Title 42 policy ends.

The U.S. House of Representatives also voted Tuesday to censure Gosar and strip him of committee assignments. He has refused to apologize, and after the vote he retweeted the video. Speaking from the House floor before the vote, Congressmember Ocasio-Cortez said, \"This is not about me. This is not about Representative Gosar. This is about what we are willing to accept.\" The co-sponsor of the censure vote, Congressmember Jackie Speier of California, said, \"Congressmember Ocasio-Cortez has become the go-to subject of the radical right to stir up their base, as too often is the case for women of color.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The House voted to censure Republican Congressmember Paul Gosar for posting an animated video on social media where he murders Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacks President Biden. Just two Republicans voted in favor of the censure: Adam Kinzinger, who said he's not going to run again, and Congressmember Liz Cheney. Gosar is the first lawmaker to be censured in more than a decade. He was also stripped of his committee assignments. Gosar has refused to apologize and retweeted the violent video after the censure vote.\n\nOn Wednesday, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy refused to condemn Gosar and called the censure vote an \"abuse of power.\" Shortly after the House minority leader spoke, Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez addressed the House.\n\nREP . ALEXANDRIA OCASIO - CORTEZ : I've been serving in this body just under three years. In that three years, an enormous amount has happened. But in response to the Republican leader's remarks when he says that this action is unprecedented, what I believe is unprecedented is for a member of House leadership of either party to be unable to condemn incitement of violence against a member of this body. It is sad. It is a sad day in which a member who leads a political party in the United States of America cannot bring themselves to say that issuing a depiction of murdering a member of Congress is wrong, and instead decides to venture off into a tangent about gas prices and inflation. What is so hard? What is so hard about saying that this is wrong?\n\nThis is not about me. This is not about Representative Gosar. But this is about what we are willing to accept. Not just the Republican leader, but I have seen other members of this party advance the argument, including Representative Gosar himself, the illusion that this was just a joke, that what we say and what we do does not matter so long as we claim a lack of meaning. Now, this nihilism runs deep, and it conveys - it conveys and betrays a certain contempt for the meaning and importance of our work here, that what we do, so long as we claim that it is a joke, doesn't matter, that what we say here doesn't matter, that our actions every day as elected leaders in the United States of America doesn't matter, that this chamber and what happens in it doesn't matter. And I am here to rise to say that it does. Our work here matters. Our example matters. There is meaning in our service.\n\nAnd as leaders in this country, when we incite violence with depictions against our colleagues, that trickles down into violence in this country. And that is where we must draw the line, independent of party, identity or belief. It is about a core recognition of human dignity and value and worth. So when we talk about, as mentioned in the resolution, that these depictions are part of a larger trend of misogyny and racial misogyny, racist misogyny, this has results in dampening the participation. And so this vote is not as complex as perhaps the Republican leader would like to make folks believe. It's pretty cut and dry. Do you find - does anyone in this chamber find this behavior acceptable? Would you allow depictions of violence against women, against colleagues? Would you allow that in your home? Do you think this should happen on a school board? In a city council? In a church? And if it's not acceptable there, why should it be accepted here?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez prior to the vote to censure Republican lawmaker Paul Gosar for posting an animated video on social media where he murders her and attacks President Biden. California Congressmember Jackie Speier also spoke Wednesday, co-sponsor of the censure vote. She herself survived the Jonestown Massacre in 1978. She was shot five times. She was then an aide to Congressmember Leo Ryan, who was assassinated during the massacre.\n\nREP . JACKIE SPEIER : I take no pleasure in introducing this resolution. No one asked me to introduce it. No one tapped me on the shoulder. I am a victim of violence. I know what it's like. I also was in the gallery clamoring for life when the shots rang out in the Speaker's Lobby.\n\nWe're here today because a sitting member thought it was OK - OK! - to post a deranged animated video of himself killing a fellow member of this House and also attacking the president of the United States. That video has been seen by 3 million people. It was up for over two days before it was taken down.\n\nInciting violence begets violence. Congressman Ocasio-Cortez has become the go-to subject of the radical right to stir up their base, as too often is the case for women of color. It is disgusting and profoundly unacceptable.\n\nTragically, the minority leader has not condemned the video. For eight days, he said nothing. Silence speaks volumes. Silence normalizes violence. Violence against women in politics is a global phenomenon. A 2016 survey by the Inter-Parliamentary Union found that 82% of women parliamentarians have experienced psychological violence, and 44% have received threats of death, rape, beatings or abduction. The intent of these online threats against women is clear: Silence them, strip them of their power, and discourage them from running for office.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : California Congressmember Jackie Speier speaking before the 223-to-207 vote to censure Republican Congressmember Paul Gosar for posting an animated video on social media where he murders Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacks President Biden.

Gosar will be required to stand in the well of the House while the resolution is read. His colleagues will also vote to strip him of his assignments on the Committee on Oversight and Reform, alongside Ocasio-Cortez, and the Committee on Natural Resources. \"He's continuing to sing to that white supremacist base that he fundraises from,\" says Jennifer Gosar, who has previously described him as a \"sociopath.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : As we move on to what's happening in Congress today, this is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nRepublican Congressmember Paul Gosar faces censure for his posting of an animated video on social media where he murders Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacks President Biden. The censure resolution is the most severe form of punishment in the House. Congressman Gosar will be required to stand in the well of the House while the resolution is read. The House will also vote to strip Gosar of his assignments on the Committee on Oversight and Reform, where he serves alongside Congressmember Ocasio-Cortez, and the House Committee on Natural Resources.\n\nCongressmember Ocasio-Cortez approved of the move to censure, saying, quote, \"Threatening the life of a colleague is grounds for expulsion... But given the Republican Party - especially the leader - is too cowardly to really enforce any standard of conduct ... censure and committee removal is the next most appropriate step,\" she said. This is House Speaker Nancy Pelosi speaking Tuesday.\n\nSPEAKER NANCY PELOSI : Why go after him?\n\nREPORTER : Yes.\n\nSPEAKER NANCY PELOSI : Because he made threats, suggestions about harming a member of Congress. That is an insult, not only an endangerment of that member of Congress, but an insult to the institution of the House of Representatives. We cannot have members joking about murdering each other, as well as threatening the president of the United States.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This comes as some Republicans have called out Republican leadership for not taking action against Gosar, even as they call to punish the 13 Republican lawmakers who voted for the bipartisan infrastructure bill. Congressmember Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who also sits on the Oversight Committee with Congressmember Gosar, called the inaction indefensible. This past weekend, the Wyoming Republican Party voted to kick Cheney out of the party.\n\nWhile Gosar has taken down the video, he has refused to apologize. On Tuesday, he met with House Republicans during a closed-door conference meeting. Gosar spoke later on The Stew Peters Show .\n\nREP . PAUL GOSAR : Well, I don't know. You know, we had conference this morning, so I explained to them what was happening. I did not apologize. I just said this video had nothing to do with harming anybody. It's exactly what you were talking about. It's an anime. We were trying to reach out to the newer generation that likes these anime, these cartoons, fabricated in Japanese likeness.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Congressmember Gosar has also spread conspiracy theories about the deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville in 2017 and the January 6th attack on the Capitol, calling the rioters \"peaceful patriots.\"\n\nThis comes as Arizona Republican Congressmember Gosar's own sister, Jennifer Gosar, has called him a \"sociopath\" and said his behavior could escalate. She and two of her siblings wrote a piece headlined \"Our brother Paul Gosar needs to be stopped. Merrick Garland, are you listening?\" She joins us now from Seattle.\n\nWelcome to Democracy Now! , Jennifer Gosar. It's really important to have you with us. You are the youngest of 10, a sister of the Representative Paul Gosar?\n\nJENNIFER GOSAR : Yeah, that's correct. There are seven - I've got seven brothers and two sisters. And I'm the youngest, and he is the eldest.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, tell us your reaction when you saw this animated video of your brother, posted by your brother, murdering Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nJENNIFER GOSAR : I was incensed, to be honest with you, but I also felt like a bone-chilling fear, because the way in which that murder takes place in the, quote, \"anime video\" - and let's be clear, there is no joking here. The AZ Mirror or some of the Arizona papers have done some really great reporting on this and, in fact, connected that same account to a 2016 anime version, as well, which, again, it's that same anime cartoon. And again, like, this is something that is not a joke. But to be honest with you, the way in which that happens, I found it bone-chilling, honestly.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And in 2018, you and five other siblings were part of an ad campaign for the Democratic challenger to Congressmember Gosar during that election. Three years later, are the feelings among all six of you still the same about the role of your brother?\n\nJENNIFER GOSAR : Like, you know, I don't - when these types of press requests come up, they come up very quickly, so I don't check. But, to be honest with you, I'm clear that my brothers and sisters are not about, like, attempted death threats to women of color. They're not intimidated, and they also do not believe in that kind of sinister approach to governance, right? They understand, as I do, that Paul is incompetent at his office, that he's never been competent, but that the election of Donald Trump has furthered his visibility and furthered his work, and he certainly utilized it.\n\nAnd, in fact, if you look at his statement, again, there is reporting that shows that he's not only not apologizing, he's continuing to sing to that white supremacist base that he fundraises from. So it's really - it's quite concerning, and I am pleasantly surprised that they've actually taken the step to have this censure vote and strip him of his committee assignments. It's the first step, it's a good step, but I don't think that's all that's called for here.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And I wanted to ask you - given the deep polarization that continues in American society, many families are confronting these deep divisions within their own families. And as we head into the holiday season and Thanksgiving, your thoughts about how families grapple with these deep divisions among siblings and parents and grandparents?\n\nJENNIFER GOSAR : Yeah, it's torturous. I've had people reach out to me from across the country to say, \"Thank you for standing up. I, too, have problems in my family.\" You know, there are parallels to this with, you know, prior to the Civil War here in the United States. So, in thinking about this, I think the most important thing to do is to stick with your integrity, to hear that voice, to reach out with compassion but be clear, be strong, because if we don't stand up to this, it only worsens. Not only have we seen that happen in our country but across the globe. When authoritarianism, when fascism is not stood up to, when it is not stymied with strong, assertive response, it only grows, and the cruelty only increases.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Have you spoken to your brother Paul, Jennifer?\n\nJENNIFER GOSAR : No, I don't speak to him. I have no desire to have communication with him. At a personal level, I gave up. When we did those ads in 2018, that was really, for me, a level of clarity, because I realized that the internal conflict I had as an interpreter, sitting with people every day in their healthcare, listening to stories of all kinds of trauma, complex PTSD , you know, the effects of poverty as it strips a body's ability to maintain itself - right? - as I sat with people, I felt like a hypocrite, because I didn't know where to speak up. I didn't know who would listen to me.\n\nSo, when the ads came up, I felt like that was the opportunity, and I was not going to miss it. And it made it clear to me that at a personal level my relationship with him was done and that I was going to reengage publicly, because I needed the help of others to actually hold him accountable, that I myself or the efforts of my brothers and sisters proved useless, that we needed actually a bigger intervention in order to hold him accountable.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And I wanted to ask you - we only have about a minute left, but the January 6th events in the Capitol, the attempted coup, and later hearing your brother, Congressmember Gosar, saying - promising blanket pardons for organizers of that day, your reactions?\n\nJENNIFER GOSAR : Well, isn't that hypocritical, right? And in fact, he asked for a pardon himself. So, you know, if this is somebody who is innocent of all charges, then why was he asking for a pardon? Why was he dangling pardons? And why aren't they actually considering that a little bit more? Because one of the things that some of these supporters and rioters themselves have talked about is that here it was, they showed up for Trump, but Trump hasn't backed them. Well, of course, we know that that would be the case. That is Donald Trump. That is Donald J. Trump in a nutshell. But, of course, my brother pertains to that. And I think it's interesting how he wants to cover over it with more zealotry and more fundraising. But the truth is, he wasn't there for his own people, and if we were, in fact, innocent of all those things, why would he offer them a pardon preemptively? Why would he seek a pardon for himself?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What do you think he will be feeling today, if he does go into the well of the House? This is highly unusual. You've called him a sociopath. You demanded the Democrats do something about him, since McCarthy is willing to throw Republicans off of committees and threaten them if they even vote with Democrats, but has not in any way even condemned Gosar.\n\nJENNIFER GOSAR : Yeah, I think if he shows up - I mean, that is a question for us: Will he actually show up? I can tell you I can imagine his skin crawling at having to hear Nancy Pelosi, Speaker Pelosi, read him the censure. I can see that being one of the most iring things for him. Without honestly the step of taking his committees, I think it would almost be laughable to him, that he would feel like, \"Well, they can't do anything. They won't do anything. They're just a bunch of gutless cowards,\" right? So, to take his committee censure, which Representative Grijalva was reported to suggest for this particular censure motion, I think is critical, right? But I think if he actually shows up, he will be utterly ired at having to hear Nancy Pelosi read that to him.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, Jennifer Gosar, we want to thank you so much for being with us, the youngest sister of Arizona Republican Congressmemeber Paul Gosar, who's being censured by the House today.\n\nNext up, climate colonialism. Why was occupied Western Sahara silenced at the U.N. climate summit? Back in 30 seconds.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Paul Gosar of Arizona asked the U.S. Capitol Police to arrest undocumented immigrants attending President Trump's State of the Union address. Gosar's threat didn't stop many undocumented activists from attending after they were invited by Democratic lawmakers. We speak to Maru Mora Villalpando, an activist and undocumented immigrant with the group Northwest Detention Center Resistance and the group Mijente. She attended the State of the Union as a guest of Washington Senator Maria Cantwell.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to bring Maru Mora Villalpando into this conversation, an activist and undocumented immigrant with the group Northwest Detention Center Resistance and the group Mijente. She attended the State of the Union address last night as a guest of Washington Senator Maria Cantwell.\n\nMaru, welcome back to Democracy Now! Talk about what the atmosphere was like inside Congress as President Trump spoke, and the significance of your being there.\n\nMARU MORA VILLALPANDO : Well, it was quite awful for me to sit next to a lot of people that were cheering him up. At some point I was able to see him clap for himself. I decided to sit down throughout the entire speech. I did not clap at all. I did get a glimpse of other-couple of people also sitting down. When we saw each other, like a young man on the same row that I was, but at the end of the row, we just raised our left fist to each other, trying to endure the whole entire speech, that felt really, really long. People stared at me when I didn't get up. Again, I saw a couple of people here and there not standing up, either.\n\nAnd I think the most important thing for me was that Trump's police, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, came to my house last month via certified mail, starting a deportation process against me. And when Senator Cantwell's office called me and invited me to join, I felt that it was my opportunity to show Trump himself that we are not going to get intimidated, we are going to continue working. People in detention called me yesterday throughout the day and told me, \"We cannot be there. But you have been the voice. We have selected you. You have a task to do, and you have to be there and endure whatever he says.\" We knew, was a racist, xenophobic speech. He scapegoated my community, along with many other communities. But it was important to show that we're not afraid, and we're going to continue in the struggle.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Now, CNN reported that Congressman Paul Gosar said he requested U.S. Capitol Police arrest undocumented immigrants attending the State of the Union. The Arizona Republican, who's known as an immigration hard-liner, tweeted his request that police consider checking identification of all attending the State of the Union address, and arresting any \"illegal aliens\" in attendance, he said. Maru, talk about your own situation, not only that you, well, might have been arrested right there, but in Washington state. You're a longtime, well-known immigrants' rights activist. But talk about the letter you recently got.\n\nMARU MORA VILLALPANDO : Yeah, on December 20th, as my daughter and I were heading out, we heard a knock at the door, and it was the mail person handing me a letter. And I saw a logo from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. I knew exactly what it was. And it's called a notice to appear, where the government, the U.S. government, via Immigration and Customs Enforcement, is beginning a deportation process against me, saying that I overstayed a visa back in '96, a tourist visa, and I need to appear before a judge. It did not include a date, but included the location, which is in downtown Seattle.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to go back to part of what President Trump said last night about his immigration plan.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Struggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families. For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. They've allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Maru Mora Villalpando, your response?\n\nMARU MORA VILLALPANDO : Well, I was trying to contain myself. It's easy to see how he was pitting people against each other, low-income workers of either brown, black communities, white communities, but also scapegoating my community, immigrant communities. It was really shocking to me to see how he utilized people's tragedies to blame my community, my immigrant community, for those tragedies.\n\nIt was also even more shocking to see people of color there standing and clapping for him and really being used, as we have been used, in general, in politics, but using people's tragedies to scapegoat our communities without talking about the real reasons why there's violence in our communities, created precisely by the same governments that created the conditions for why people end up being violent.\n\nI think that it was just a huge racist, xenophobic, nativist rhetoric. And again, I just-I just tried to go throughout the night thinking, \"I have to be here,\" and I know that even though the majority of people there were clapping and standing for him, I knew that people outside would not agree with him.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

The attack on the Capitol briefly shut down Congress as lawmakers fled for their safety from the mob, which included members of the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers and other violent extremist groups. Two years later, part of Congress has been effectively shut down again, this time because a group of far-right Republicans, including many who supported the January 6 insurrection, have blocked Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy's attempt to become House speaker. We speak to Andy Campbell, senior editor at HuffPost and author of \"We Are Proud Boys: How a Right-Wing Street Gang Ushered In a New Era of American Extremism,\" as the House speaker vote drags on and the Proud Boys face trial for seditious conspiracy over their involvement in the insurrection.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Today marks two years since the January 6th Capitol insurrection, when President Donald Trump incited thousands of supporters to violently storm Congress in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election. The attack on the Capitol briefly shut down Congress as lawmakers fled for their safety from the mob, which included members of the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers and other violent extremist groups, many of them armed.\n\nTwo years later, part of Congress has been effectively shut down again, this time because a group of far-right Republicans, including many who supported the January 6th insurrection, have blocked Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy's attempt to become House speaker. This means no member of the House of Representatives can be sworn in. Over the past three days, the House has held 11 votes to choose a speaker. McCarthy has failed each time to win the needed 218 votes to become speaker, despite making numerous concessions to his critics in the so-called Freedom Caucus. This is now the longest speaker election since 1859, just before the Civil War.\n\nMeanwhile, President Biden is preparing to give a major speech today marking the second anniversary of the January 6th insurrection. He will also award Presidential Citizens Medals to 12 people who responded to the insurrection and Trump's attacks on democracy after the 2020 election - among them, Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, a mother-daughter pair of election workers from Georgia who received death threats and torrents of online abuse from Trump supporters. Another honoree will be former Washington, D.C., police officer Michael Fanone, who was beaten and electrocuted with a Taser by the right-wing mob. Fanone spoke Thursday and made the link between the January 6th insurrection and the congressional chaos playing out today.\n\nMICHAEL FANONE : But if I could guarantee one thing about the new House majority, it's this: This is just the beginning. This type of chaos will happen every single day in the House, as some of the most extreme politicians our country has ever seen hold our democracy hostage. I should know. Tomorrow marks two years since the day I almost died defending the Capitol from people who thought overthrowing the government was a good idea. The events of that day felt like a wake-up call for me and many others, that political violence is real. The worst part is that our elected leaders allowed this to happen.\n\nAnd yet, this week, people who encouraged and even attended the insurrection are now taking their places as leaders in the new House majority - people like Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who said insurrectionists would have won on January 6th if she had been involved, or Representative Matt Gaetz, who encouraged voters to arm themselves at the polls.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was former Washington, D.C., police officer Michael Fanone. On Thursday, the partner of the deceased Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who died one day after responding to the insurrection, sued Donald Trump and two of the rioters who attacked Sicknick, for his wrongful death. Brian Sicknick died after suffering two strokes; the medical examiner said the events of January 6th \"played a role in his condition.\"\n\nBiden will also honor Capitol Police officer Caroline Edwards, who suffered a brain injury after being beaten by rioters. She testified before the January 6th House select committee in June.\n\nCAROLINE EDWARDS : When I fell behind that line, and I saw - I can just remember my breath catching in my throat, because what I saw was just a war scene. It was something like I had seen out of the movies. I couldn't believe my eyes. There were officers on the ground. You know, they were bleeding. They were throwing up. They were - you know, they had - I mean, I saw friends with blood all over their faces. I was slipping in people's blood. You know, I was catching people as they fell. You know, I was - it was carnage. It was chaos. I can't - I can't even describe what I saw.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The second anniversary of the January 6th insurrection comes as five members of the far-right group Proud Boys are on trial for seditious conspiracy, opening arguments expected next week.\n\nWe're joined now by Andy Campbell, senior editor at HuffPost and the author of We Are Proud Boys: How a Right-Wing Street Gang Ushered In a New Era of American Extremism .\n\nAndy, welcome back to Democracy Now! It's great to have you with us. So, today is the second anniversary. Two years ago today, the violent mob attacked the Capitol. And it is so interesting, as they stopped congressional proceedings then, for a time, that today, two years later, we're seeing the House paralyzed. No member of the House of Representatives can be sworn in, the new ones or the old ones. No one gets classified briefings - nothing - because of what's happening here. Can you draw a parallel between who was involved two years ago and who is involved today?\n\nANDY CAMPBELL : Sure. And thanks, Amy, for having me on again.\n\nLook, we are seeing a GOP that's hoist by its own petard. I mean, this is a party that has built its identity around nationalism, around bigotry, around political violence, and particularly around trolling, not around policy necessarily. And so, now you have these 20 holdouts who are that directive personified. You have people like Lauren Boebert and Marjorie Taylor Greene. And you have Paul Gosar, an avowed sort of white nationalist character who pals around with extremists and goes on - goes to white nationalist conferences to speak. And so you have these very extreme far-right voices throwing a wrench in the spokes, and this is exactly what the MAGA party has built for themselves. And so, they're kind of seeing the consequences of their own actions when these holdouts are kind of holding Congress hostage.\n\nBut what they're doing is they're, you know, displaying power. The very far-right, very racist, very loud and popular troll wing of the GOP has sort of been building this parallel power structure alongside the GOP for years under Trump. And now with this four-vote majority that the Republicans have in the House, they're able to exercise that power by holding the speaker hostage here.\n\nAnd so, it's interesting that this is happening on the anniversary of January 6, because those same people who are holding Congress hostage now are the same people who helped foment the insurrection and who, after the fact, still cast doubt on the 2020 election. Many of them are Trump loyalists and election deniers and voted to overturn the election. And so, what we're seeing is that the spirit of January 6 is still very much alive, and we are seeing it play out in the halls of Congress today.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, if you can talk about, since you wrote the book We Are Proud Boys , the connection between the pro-insurrectionist congressmembers and the Proud Boys? And talk about who they are. But I wanted to ask you about the people who are leading this movement right now. I mean, you have, what, Matt Gaetz, the congressman from Florida, who is under investigation for underage sex trafficking. You've got Lauren Boebert from - she ran a restaurant in, what, Rifle, Colorado, called Shooters Grill. It's been shut down because the owners of the building wouldn't renew her lease. She encouraged her waiters to openly carry guns as they served their customers. And now they've removed magnetometers - this was one of the demands of Boebert and the others in this ultraconservative so-called Freedom Caucus - from the House. She had originally - I think it's the reason why House Speaker, at the time, Nancy Pelosi had put up magnetometers - said she was going to carry a Glock onto the floor of the House. Looking at the New York Post , they said she refused to say Tuesday if she plans to bring a gun into the House of Representatives as authorities removed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's magnetometers from the entrances. Go through these people one by one, and talk about their connection to Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, Three Percenters and what happened two years ago today.\n\nANDY CAMPBELL : Sure. I mean, Lauren Boebert is sort of leading the charge here on this ultra-far-right group of holdouts. You know, she also called Ilhan Omar a terrorist. I mean, if you try to look at Boebert's policies, they are few and far between. A lot of these guys want to push very nationalist policy. They want to push the anti-woke agenda. I think they want to criminalize doctors who give gender-affirming care. So, these are sort of cruel policies, if you look really hard.\n\nBut most of all, these are sort of bigoted trolls, very connected to the insurrection. You have Paul Gosar of Arizona, who, like I said, went on to speak at a white nationalist conference two years running, alongside Marjorie Taylor Greene. He said at one point that he fomented the revolution on January 6. You have Matt Gaetz, who has pushed white supremacist conspiracy theories about the replacement of white men and has also had Proud Boys work security at his events over the years. And so, you have - these characters are connected to the insurrection in the way that they believe it was justified, or at least believe that the election was stolen.\n\nAnd then, the Proud Boys are these foot soldiers that act on behalf of the GOP's grievances. And so, while the Boeberts and Gaetzes and Marjorie Taylor Greenes of America are pushing, you know, anti- LGBTQ sentiment, anti-immigrant sentiment, the Proud Boys are mobilizing on these grievances. And certainly, we know that dozens of Proud Boys joined hundreds of other extremists to make January 6 happen. And so, there is absolutely a connection there between the people sitting there in the House today and the Proud Boys. And, you know, I think it shows that what we are looking at happening out there isn't - like, Boebert isn't trying to make some real policy changes happen today. She's trying to show power and show that this small group of ultra-far-right insurrectionists can wield power in the Republican Party.\n\nAnd the Proud Boys, being those foot soldiers, are sitting in court today. The jury is being selected for their seditious conspiracy trial. And what's interesting about that trial is that we're going to learn more about their connections to the GOP leading up to January 6, because there are a number of Proud Boys who have already pleaded guilty, and they will be testifying against their own in that seditious conspiracy trial. So we may learn more about their connections to people like Roger Stone, Trump's top confidant, who counts the leader of the Proud Boys, Enrique Tarrio, as one of his friends and mentees. We may learn more about the security that they did for certain members of Congress. And we may learn more about their connection to Trump's inner circle. So, this is going to be a huge trial, and it's going to have big implications for the GOP going forward.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, tell us who the Proud Boys are, who Enrique Tarrio and the at least four other Proud Boys who are on trial are.\n\nANDY CAMPBELL : Right. So, the Proud Boys are a far-right street gang that were launched in late 2016, early 2017. They were created on the far-right talk show of Gavin McInnes, who was also the co-founder of Vice Media. And he built them to basically mobilize on Trump and the GOP's grievances and go out there and do what crusty old Republicans can't do, and fight people in the street, based on what the GOP is complaining about. And so, on any given day, the complaint might change. Sometimes it's BLM , sometimes it's antifa, sometimes it's LGBTQ . Right now it's very much LGBTQ . And sometimes it's the election. And they have mobilized over the years, over and over, based on those grievances.\n\nNow, there are five Proud Boys on trial for seditious conspiracy. The Justice Department believes that they had a hand not only in making the insurrection happen on the day, but planning it leading up. Trump, during a debate in 2020, said, \"Proud Boys, stand back, stand by.\" And there's some debate over what he meant by that, but the Proud Boys immediately took it as marching orders. One of the guys on trial, Joe Biggs, posted a blog titled \"The Second Civil War Is Coming.\" He said, \"Clean your guns, get ammo, and be ready, because it's about to get really bad.\" Enrique Tarrio started raising funds, amassing weapons, amassing people, recruiting. He said - he told me, in an interview, that he had never gotten so many recruiting calls than in the moments after Trump said, \"Stand back, stand by,\" at that debate. So they were gearing up for January 6, which they saw as their final stand for Trump. And they were doing what they do best, which is amassing all of these people, you know, different extremists from across the country, polling them, telling them to show up on January 6 for Donald Trump.\n\nAnd then, of course, we know from the January 6 committee's reports and the convictions that have already happened, that once the plan was in place, once the insurrection began, Trump did absolutely nothing to stop the mob, and, in fact, incited them throughout the day to continue on this parade of violence. The Justice -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go to YouTube video created by Vic Berger back in 2018, which features Gavin McInnes, the founder of the Proud Boys, discussing the group's origins, as well as calling for violence in the streets.\n\nGAVIN McINNES: I started this gang called the Proud Boys. And -\n\nJOE ROGAN : The Proud Boys?\n\nGAVIN McINNES: The Proud Boys.\n\nJOE ROGAN : What is - what's Proud Boys about?\n\nGAVIN McINNES: We will kill you. That's the Proud Boys, in a nutshell. We will kill you. We look nice. We seem soft. We have \"boys\" in our name. But like Bill the Butcher and the Bowery Boys, we will assassinate you. Now, part of the reason I agreed to do the talk is because I'm allowed to bring all my guys, and we can fight our way in and fight our way out.\n\nBeating the [bleep] our of these people, I think it's our job to do it.\n\nPROUD BOY : [bleep] you, mother [bleep]!\n\nGAVIN McINNES: And the cops', to turn a blind eye.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, if you can talk about McInnes and also this latest headline this week, NYPD facing new backlash after officers escorted members of the far-right Proud Boys to a subway station, apparently helping them evade their fares, after they sought to disrupt Drag Story Hour, a popular reading event for children, at a Queens library last year? You know, you have them cracking down on fare evasion, flooding subway stations with police, but they're escorting the Proud Boys?\n\nANDY CAMPBELL : Right, right. So, you know, who you heard right there is Gavin McInnes. That guy you just heard is expected to possibly be a character witness for his Proud Boys at their sedition trial. So, you can see what their ideology is. Their ideology is political violence. He put political violence in their rules set. And certainly the misogyny and anti- LGBTQ and racist sentiment is within their tenets. And so, he kind of created that worldview for the Proud Boys and unleashed them on the world.\n\nBut, like you said, with this incident in New York, the Proud Boys have shown resiliency time and time again, despite being involved in all sorts of domestic extremism events. January 6, and all of the hundreds of prosecutions that we've seen following that, has done almost nothing to tamp down our street-level political violent extremist sect. I mean, the Proud Boys are mobilizing today at rapid clip. You have Tucker Carlson on Fox News complaining about Drag Queen Story Hour, and the Proud Boys are going out in the street and harassing and attacking Drag Queen Story Hours. This isn't just in New York; it's all across the country, at public libraries and anywhere they have drag events.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, I know, Andy, you're headed down to Washington, D.C., to cover this seditious conspiracy trial of the Proud Boys, and we hope to have you back on. Andy Campbell, senior editor at HuffPost , author of We Are Proud Boys: How a Right-Wing Street Gang Ushered In a New Era of American Extremism .\n\nComing up, the Russian president has declared a 36-hour ceasefire in Ukraine. We'll hear from Bishop William Barber on why he supports a Christmas truce on both sides. Back in 30 seconds.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "Republican ex-congressman suggests colleagues 'had serious cognitive issues'\n\nPaul Gosar and Louie Gohmert were eager to believe 'wild, dramatic fantasies', claims Denver Riggleman in new book\n\nThe Republican congressmen Louis Gohmert and Paul Gosar adopted such extreme, conspiracy-tinged positions, even before the US Capitol attack , that a fellow member of the rightwing Freedom Caucus thought they \"may have had serious cognitive issues\".\n\nDenver Riggleman, once a US representative from Virginia, reports his impression of his former colleagues from Texas and Arizona in a new book .\n\nThe Breach: The Untold Story of the Investigation into January 6th is published in the US on Tuesday. The Guardian obtained an early copy.\n\nRiggleman is a former US air force intelligence officer who lost his seat in Congress after he officiated a same-sex marriage. In his book, he describes fallout beyond his primary defeat , including someone tampering with the wheels of his truck, endangering the life of his daughter.\n\n\"If I ever find the individual who did that,\" he writes, \"God help that person.\"\n\nAfter leaving Congress, Riggleman worked for the House January 6 committee, members of which were reportedly angered by his decision to publish a book.\n\nDescribing text messages surrendered to the committee by Mark Meadows, Donald Trump's last chief of staff, Riggleman shows that on 5 November 2020, two days after election day and with the result not called, Gohmert touted his experience as an attorney and tried to join the White House team working to overturn Joe Biden's win.\n\n\"I'm in DC,\" Gohmert wrote to Meadows. \"Thinking I'll head to Philadelphia to fuss. Would love to be there ... at [White House] to be ear for discussions and advice if asked. Handled massive fraud case vs Texas biggest utility ... so some legal experience. May I come over?\"\n\nMeadows asked Gohmert to go on TV instead.\n\nBut Gohmert remained in Trump's orbit. On 20 December, along with Scott Perry (Pennsylvania), Andy Biggs (Arizona), Jody Hice (Georgia), Matt Gaetz (Florida), Mo Brooks (Alabama) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (Georgia), he attended a White House meeting with Trump at which election subversion was discussed.\n\nAccording to testimony to the January 6 committee, Gohmert, Gaetz, Brooks, Greene, Perry and Biggs asked for pardons before Trump left office.\n\nOn 6 January 2021, a crowd Trump knew to be armed but told to \"fight like hell\" breached Congress in an attempt to stop certification of the election. Nine deaths have been linked to the riot, including law enforcement suicides.\n\nRiggleman describes how in the aftermath of the attack, Gohmert and other Republicans continued to push conspiracy theories, claiming the attackers were leftwingers disguised as Trump supporters.\n\nSuch claims have entered the Republican mainstream. So has the far right.\n\nDescribing his own spell in Congress, between 2019 and 2021, Riggleman says he joined the hardline Freedom Caucus as a way to allay concerns among conservatives that he was insufficiently loyal to Trump.\n\nOnce in, he says, he \"began to understand that some of my colleagues had fully bought into even the more unhinged conspiracy theories I had been seeing out on the campaign trail\".\n\nRiggleman describes one meeting in which Gohmert \"promoted a conspiracy theory related to master algorithms\", saying he \"suspected there was a secret technology shadow-banning conservatives across all platforms\".\n\nRiggleman writes that others \"nodded along\", though \"of course, that's crazy\". He says he said \"something to that effect\" during the meeting in question.\n\nIn subsequent meetings, Riggleman \"would come to see that Gohmert was one of a few colleagues who had gone deep down the rabbit hole.\n\n\"Scott Perry, Jody Hice, Randy Weber and the caucus chairman, Andy Biggs, all said things that stunned me.\"\n\nGosar is a far-right provocateur whose many controversies include being censured for tweeting a video depicting violence against Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a prominent New York progressive.\n\nRiggleman says Gosar and Gohmert \"seemed to be joined at the brain stem when it came to their eagerness to believe wild, dramatic fantasies about Democrats, the media and big tech.\n\n\"I came to believe Gosar and Gohmert may have had serious cognitive issues.\"\n\nRiggleman also calls Gosar \"a blatant white supremacist\", describing him and the Iowa Republican Steve King \"making a case for white supremacy over pulled pork and ribs\".\n\n\"It was unbelievable,\" Riggleman writes. \"I had always bristled when I'd hear Democrats dismiss Republicans as 'racists'. To me, it seemed like an easy insult that dodged policy discussions. Now, here I was behind the curtain, seeing that some of my colleagues really seemed to hold these awful views.\"\n\nDescribing his own farewell address, which he made a month before the Capitol attack, Riggleman claims to have been \"the canary in the coalmine\" regarding extremism in the Republican party.\n\n\"On 10 December 2020,\" he writes, \"less than a month before the Capitol attack, I ... railed against disinformation and 'super-spreader digital viruses that create a fever of nonsense' ... I noted how QAnon promoters were linked with both the conspiracists who questioned the Covid pandemic and Trump's Stop the Steal movement to overturn the election.\n\n\"... Based on what I had been seeing, I warned that we were heading down a very dark road. No one listened.\"\n\nThe Breach by Denver Riggleman (Pan Macmillan, £22).

      "text": "'The most dangerous man in Congress': how Paul Gosar became a darling of the far right\n\nOnce fringe, now dominant in the party, rightwing Republicans are strategizing for minoritarian rule\n\nT he Arizona Republican congressman Paul Gosar had a simple message for the crowd when he recently addressed a packed Donald Trump rally in his home state - a gathering that had focused on promoting the baseless lie that Trump had been cheated out of a second term as president.\n\n\"This is where it all began,\" Gosar said in a speech before Trump came on stage. \"This is where we questioned: 'Was there fraud? Absolutely. Was it enough to overturn the election? Absolutely.'\"\n\nThe far-right congressman is one of Trump's most loyal backers in Congress, earning him one of more than 90 endorsements made so far by the former US president ahead of this year's crucial midterm elections. Gosar is the kind of politician that Trump - who is embarking on a series of rallies to try to cement his allies' power in the Republican party - is increasingly seeking to support.\n\nBut Gosar has extensive links to white nationalists and Capitol rioters and, many observers say, represents a dangerous new breed of Republican politician, who would have once been considered fringe, but whom Trump is increasingly making central to Republican party politics.\n\n\"I'm considered the most dangerous man in Congress,\" Gosar told the crowd, briefly touching on popular rightwing talking points - critical race theory in schools, disrespect for the military, and \"empty shelves\" in stores - before focusing on the central theme of the rally: elections.\n\nIn the Arizona desert the fervor among supporters huddled against the wind was a clear sign of the size of a constituency more loyal to Trump than to the party, and even as some lawmakers distance themselves from the former president amid the January 6 fallout, the far right is doubling down.\n\nIn his first public appearance since the anniversary of the January 6 attack, Trump's appearance was marked with a reaffirmation of election denial, conspiracy theories and anti-democratic ruminations. \"I ran twice, and I won twice,\" Trump told his supporters gathered in the windy Arizona night.\n\nAt the rally the \"Stop the Steal\" organizer Ali Alexander moved through the crowd while on stage three members of Congress, who all voted against certifying Joe Biden's 2020 presidential election victory, gave speeches affirming their support of the \"big lie\".\n\nGosar's allegiance to Trump and his false claims extends beyond speaking the shibboleth of the big lie: on January 6 Gosar voted against certifying the election even as rioters penetrated the Capitol.\n\n\"We no longer have an ability to make a clear delineation between the right and far-right in the Republican party,\" said Joe Lowndes, professor of political science at the University of Oregon and co-author of Producers, Parasites, Patriots: Race and the New Right-Wing Politics of Precarity.\n\n\"The Trumpist wing of the Republicans isn't just ascending - it's the dominant wing of the Republican party. It's the dominant wing not just in national politics, but in state and local politics as well,\" said Lowndes. \"The Republican party has committed itself to a party of minoritarian rule, figuring out ways to rule in the long term without having majority support of voters.\"\n\nGosar's involvement with the January 6 Capitol insurrection has come under scrutiny from lawmakers. A House select committee investigating the deadly Capitol attack has been working for six months, in meetings mostly closed to the public, interviewing more than 300 witnesses and collecting more than 35,000 pages of records, according the Washington Post.\n\nInformation has surfaced that link Gosar to one prominent Capitol riot organizer.\n\nA lawsuit filed by Alexander to block the release of his phone records, subpoenaed by the House committee, reveals testimony that discloses contacts with Republican members of Congress before the Capitol riot. The lawsuit states Alexander testified that he \"had a few phone conversations\" with Gosar and spoke to the Arizona congressman Andy Biggs \"in person\".\n\nLawmakers are debating whether sitting members of Congress can be subpoenaed to appear before the committee.\n\nGosar also has longstanding links to far-right and white nationalist groups.\n\nLast year Gosar was the keynote speaker at an America First Political Action Conference (Afpac) organized by white nationalist Nick Fuentes, whom the Department of Justice in a court filing calls a \"white supremacist\" and who marched in the deadly Charlottesville \"Unite the Right\" rally. The January 6 committee is also seeking testimony from Fuentes, who has praised Gosar as supporting his agenda.\n\n\"There is some hope, maybe, for America First in Congress, and that is thanks almost exclusively to representative Paul Gosar,\" said Fuentes in a video message to his supporters last year.\n\nGosar distanced himself from Fuentes after outcry over his appearance alongside the white nationalist in a promotion for a fundraising event. But he has also appeared to defend him. Gosar once tweeted: \"Not sure why anyone is freaking out. I'll say this: there are millions of Gen Z, Y and X conservatives. They believe in America First. They will not agree 100% on every issue. No group does. We will not let the left dictate our strategy, alliances and efforts. Ignore the left.\"\n\nThat was not the first time Gosar has incorporated white nationalist themes into his politics.\n\nLast year Gosar and the extremist Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene were linked to an \"America First Caucus\" that imploded in disarray after planning documents reported by Punchbowl News revealed language that included recruiting people based on \"Anglo-Saxon political traditions\".\n\nGosar was also censured and stripped of his committee posts late last year after tweeting a Photoshopped video of a violent anime sequence depicting him killing congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking President Biden.\n\n\"I do not espouse violence towards anyone,\" Gosar said during the House debate on his censure. \"I voluntarily took the cartoon down, not because it was itself a threat, but because some thought it was. Out of compassion for those who genuinely felt offense, I self-censored.\"\n\nBut Gosar has a history posting of far-right content, including retweeting a QAnon conspiracy theory and a now-deleted tweet of a meme popular in white nationalists circles.\n\nYet it is now in the area of election integrity that Gosar is becoming most prominent, helping to lead a charge across the US by Republicans claiming that elections in America are vulnerable to fraud and manipulation.\n\n\"There's a comfortable embrace of anti-democratic sentiment,\" said Lowndes. \"The Republican party hasn't just opened the door to the far right, but it now relies on the far right.\"\n\nAt the Arizona rally Gosar told supporters to campaign locally on the election fraud issue. \"Take it upon yourself that in your county you go to your county recorder and ask them what your ballot does. Make them walk you through it. That'll tell them one thing: that you're watching them. That you're not going to let this happen, what happened in January of last year.\"\n\nGosar was among the Arizona Republican officials pushing for an audit of the election results of Maricopa county, the state's most populous county. Before the Trump rally, the Maricopa elections department released a 93-page report rebutting each of the 76 claims about the 2020 elections made by elected Arizona Republican officials.\n\nThe report found \"the November 2020 General Election was administered with integrity and the results were accurate and reliable.\" The report also found \"despite all evidence to the contrary, false allegations continue to persist and damage voter confidence.\"\n\nBut there is at least one group of people close to Gosar who are not fooled - some of his own family.\n\nThree of Gosar's siblings have publicly called for their brother to be expelled from Congress, the Arizona Republic has reported . \"We know him to be an extremist and we took that very seriously,\" his sister, Jennifer Gosar, told the newspaper. His brother, Dave Gosar, told NBC News: \"I consider him a traitor to this country. I consider him a traitor to his family.\" In the 2018 election six of Gosar's nine siblings endorsed his opponent."

Paul Gosar of Arizona was named to oversight and natural resources.\n\nDemocrats removed Greene from committees in February 2021, citing incendiary behavior including advocating the assassination of opponents and voicing support for QAnon and other conspiracy theories, including bizarre claims about 9/11 and the Parkland school shooting.\n\nEleven Republicans supported Greene's removal but despite being condemned by party leaders for speaking at a white supremacist conference last February, the Georgia congresswoman has since become close to McCarthy.\n\nEarlier this month, Greene did not join the far-right rebellion which dragged McCarthy through 15 rounds of voting before he was confirmed as speaker.\n\nA congresswoman who recently said the January 6 attack on the US Capitol would have succeeded had she organised it will now sit on the homeland security committee.\n\nThat panel is set to spearhead Republican attacks, possibly including impeachment, against Alejandro Mayorkas, Joe Biden's secretary of homeland security, over immigration policy and border security.\n\nOn Tuesday, Greene tweeted : \"It is time to restore dignity to the people, Border Patrol, ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement], and the families who have lost a loved one to the cartel's fentanyl murders and illegal alien crime.\n\n\"I serve the American people and no one else. As far as I'm concerned American dignity is the only one that matters.\"\n\nThe oversight committee is also due to lead Republican attacks on Biden and his administration. Its chairman, James Comer of Kentucky, has fronted early salvoes over the discovery of classified documents at a Biden office and residence, from his time as vice-president to Barack Obama.\n\nGosar, who attended the same white supremacist conference as Greene, was censured and removed from committees in November 2021, after tweeting an anime-style video which showed him striking the New York progressive Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a sword and also menacing Biden. Two Republicans supported his removal.\n\nEarlier this month, early in the run of votes by which McCarthy became speaker, Gosar and Ocasio-Cortez were filmed talking to each other in the House chamber.\n\nOcasio-Cortez told MSNBC : \"In chaos, anything is possible, especially in this era.\""

      "text": "'Inciting violence begets violence': Paul Gosar censured over video aimed at AOC\n\nTrump loyalist removed from committee assignments for video showing him killing Ocasio-Cortez and attacking President Biden\n\nThe House delivered an extraordinary rebuke of congressman Paul Gosar on Wednesday, by formally censuring the Arizona Republican and removing his committee assignments for posting an animated video that depicted him killing Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking Joe Biden.\n\nGosar, a loyalist of Donald Trump and one of the most far-right members of Congress, sat in the chamber and listened as his colleagues debated the censure against him - the harshest form of punishment the chamber can mete short of expulsion.\n\n\"This is not about me. This is not about Representative Gosar,\" Ocasio-Cortez said in a speech before the vote. \"This is about what we are willing to accept.\"\n\n\"What is so hard about saying that this is wrong?\" she asked.\n\nThe sanction was approved on a largely party-line vote, 223 to 207, with all Democrats and just two Republicans - Congresswoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Congressman Adam Kinzinger of Illinois - voting in favor. Gosar was also stripped of his membership on the House Oversight Committee, where he serves alongside Ocasio-Cortez, and the Natural Resources Committee, which deals with issues critical to his state.\n\nShortly after the vote, Gosar was called to stand in the \"well\" of the chamber as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi read aloud the resolution. The formal ritual, intended as a public rebuke of the censured member, was over moments later. Republicans encircled Gosar, shaking his hand and patting him on the back.\n\nGosar posted the video earlier this month from his congressional Twitter account, asking, \"Any anime fans out there?\"\n\nThe video, which Gosar called a \"cartoon\" and has since removed, depicts the Arizona congressman as an anime character slashing another figure with the face of Ocasio-Cortez in the neck with a sword. The cartoon version of Gosar then menaces his swords at Biden.\n\nThe censure comes just 10 months after pro-Trump rioters stormed the US Capitol on 6 January hunting for lawmakers and threatening to \"hang\" the vice-president. As supporters of Trump continue to lash out and threaten Republican lawmakers who they deem insufficiently loyal, party leaders have become increasingly tolerant of violent rhetoric within their ranks.\n\nThe House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, condemned Republicans' overwhelming silence as \"outrageous\".\n\n\"These actions demand a response,\" she said.\n\nHouse minority leader Kevin McCarthy and other Republican leaders have refused to publicly condemn Gosar for sharing the video and urged their caucus to oppose the sanction.\n\nMcCarthy called the censure vote an \"abuse of power\" by Democrats, designed to distract from their legislative agenda and other national issues, such as rising inflation and immigration. He also accused Democrats of imposing a double standard that failed to hold members of their own caucus accountable for controversial rhetoric.\n\nJackie Speier, a Democrat from California who introduced the resolution, said partisanship was not the issue.\n\n\"Inciting violence begets violence,\" said Speier, a survivor of the 1978 Jonestown massacre. \"Let me be clear, if a Democrat did the same thing, I would introduce the same resolution.\"\n\n\"Threatening and showing the killing of a member of this House. Can't that appall you?\" asked House majority leader Steny Hoyer, staring at the Republican side of the aisle. \"Do you have no shame?\"\n\nFar from being chastened, Gosar was defiant.\n\n\"No matter how much the left tries to quiet me, I will continue to speak out,\" he said. He did not apologize and instead insisted that the video was not intended as a threat.\n\nDemocrats argued that depictions of violence and violent rhetoric from public officials can incite actual violence, pointing to the insurrection at the US Capitol as an example.\n\n\"We cannot dismiss representative Gosar's violent fantasies as a joke, because in this decade, in this American, someone's going to take him seriously,\" said congresswoman Mary Gay Scanlon, a Democrat from Pennsylvania.\n\nGosar, a dentist who was first elected in 2010, has been tied to white nationalist and rightwing militia groups. In Arizona, his own siblings have appeared in campaign videos urging voters to remove their brother from office.\n\nOn 6 January Gosar objected to the certification of Arizona's electors for Biden. In the lead-up to the attack on the Capitol, the Arizona congressman amplified the \"Big Lie\" conspiracy that baselessly claims the election was stolen from Trump. He has since defended the rioters and falsely claimed that the insurrection was a leftwing provocation.\n\nIn its history, the House has censured members on nearly two dozen occasions, only six of which occurred in the last century.\n\nThe most recent censure was in 2010, after a lengthy congressional investigation found congressman Charlie Rangel, a Democrat of New York, guilty of a series of ethics violations. Pelosi presided over the censure of Rangel, a member of her own caucus, and a majority of his party supported the sanction.\n\nEarlier this year, House Democrats took the unprecedented step of ousting Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, a far-right Trump ally from Georgia, from her committee assignments for spreading dangerous and hateful conspiracy theories.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has tied Gosar's behavior to a larger pattern of abuse and harassment by Republican members of Congress. In a floor speech last year, Ocasio-Cortez publicly denounced congressman Ted Yoho of Florida for calling her a \"fucking bitch\" during a heated exchange over rising crime rates and poverty.\n\nIn the resolution, Democrats excoriate Gosar for targeting Ocasio-Cortez, the youngest woman ever to serve in Congress.\n\n\"Violence against women in politics is a global phenomenon meant to silence women and discourage them from seeking positions of authority and participating in public life, with women of color disproportionately impacted,\" it states."

The video ends with an apparent threat to Biden.\n\nOcasio-Cortez was in Glasgow on Tuesday, attending the Cop26 climate summit.\n\nOn Twitter, she wrote: \"A creepy member I work with who fundraises for neo-Nazi groups shared a fantasy video of him killing me and he'll face no consequences because [McCarthy] cheers him on with excuses ... well, back to work because institutions don't protect women of color.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez listed other instances of threatening behavior from Republicans in Congress.\n\n\"Remember when [Ted] Yoho accosted me on the Capitol [steps] and called me a f[uck]ing b[itch].

Keep exposing them.\"\n\nThe Yale historian Joanne Freeman, author of The Field of Blood , a well-regarded history of violence in Congress before the civil war, wrote : \"Threats of violence lead to actual violence. They clear the ground. They cow opposition. They plant the idea. They normalize it. They encourage it. They maim democracy.

We love @DrPaulGosar, don't we folks?\" The retweet appears to have since been undone.\n\nGosar also retweeted other Republican politicians and public figures, both on his personal and congressional Twitter accounts, that have called Gosar a political \"martyr\" and denounced his censure.\n\nGosar has not apologized for the video and called the censure \" kabuki theater \" and a \" hysterical mob \" in a series of new tweets published after the vote.\n\nFollowing the censure vote, Gosar also released a statement saying that his censure could incite violence, comparing the censure to the events that led up to the 2015 Charlie Hebdo massacre .\n\n\"I remind everyone that pretending to be upset over a cartoon is what happened to the Charlie Hebdo magazine in France,\" said Gosar. \"All right-thinking people condemned that then, and they should condemn the Democrats now for their violation of free speech.\"\n\nOn Wednesday the House voted to censure Gosar, with 223 in favor and 207 against.

Congressman Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and Congresswoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming voted in favor of censuring Gosar, and Congressman David Joyce of Ohio voted \"present\", the lone Republican member to do so.\n\nRepublican members have been called out in the past for threatening violence against Democratic representatives, particularly women of color. In February, the House stripped the Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene from her committee assignments after her social media posts were flagged for supporting violence against Ocasio-Cortez, the Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar and Michigan congresswoman Rashida Tlaib."

      "text": "'The goal was to silence people': historian Joanne Freeman on congressional violence\n\nPaul Gosar was censured for a video depicting a colleague's murder but physical assaults were a feature of the pre-civil war era\n\nA s the House debated whether the Republican congressman Paul Gosar should be censured for depicting the murder of his colleague, one Democratic leader took a moment to reflect on the chamber's long history of violence.\n\nSpeaking on the House floor last week, the majority leader, Steny Hoyer, argued that Gosar had grossly violated the chamber's rules of conduct by sharing an altered anime video showing him killing Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking President Joe Biden.\n\n\"When those rules were written, they did not anticipate that a member would threaten violence directly against another member,\" Hoyer said. \"Not because it's never happened - a congressman from South Carolina nearly beat to death a senator from Massachusetts, Senator Sumner, because he wanted to abolish slavery.\"\n\nThe 1856 caning of Charles Sumner by Preston Brooks is probably the most infamous example of violence between members of Congress, but it is far from the only one. In her book, The Field of Blood: Violence in Congress and the Road to Civil War, the Yale history professor Joanne Freeman details the many threats and attacks between lawmakers during the antebellum era.\n\nThe Guardian spoke to Dr Freeman about the history of congressional violence and what it can tell us about the current state of US politics and the significance of Gosar's censure. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBesides the caning of Sumner, what were some of the other examples of congressional violence in the pre- civil war era?\n\nThe research that I did revealed there were at least 70 violent incidents in the House and in the Senate. Some of them were canings. Some of them were fist fights. Some of them were actual brawls with groups of congressmen. In the well of the House where we saw [Gosar's] censure take place, that was actually a location for several fights in those decades before the civil war.\n\nAnd there was a lot of deployment of threats and intimidation. Most of these were offered by southerners and usually were deployed against people who had anything to say against slavery. Obviously the goal of that was to silence people or intimidate people so they wouldn't even stand up to say anything that was not going to be to the liking of southerners.\n\nWhat effect did those threats have on public debate over slavery in Congress?\n\nThere's a diary entry from a very prominent, very aggressive anti-slavery advocate, named Joshua Giddings from Ohio. And when he first gets to Congress, he reports something like, \"Our northern friends are afraid.\" They're afraid to stand up against the southerners. So there's clearly evidence that people were afraid to stand up.\n\nAnd not only does it shape the direction of debate, the people who do that kind of threatening very often are wildly supported by the folks back home. I suppose that's what we're going to see now; the person who does that kind of bullying and that kind of threatening gets a good degree of support for it.\n\nAlthough Gosar was censured and stripped of his committee assignments, he was also somewhat rewarded for his behavior. Donald Trump immediately offered Gosar his endorsement, and the minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, suggested that he might get \"better committee assignments\" when Republicans regain control of the House. Is there a history of lawmakers being rewarded for violence?\n\nUnfortunately, yes. Most notoriously, look at Preston Brooks, who caned Charles Sumner, and Laurence Keitt, who held people off from intervening in the caning. There was discussion of expelling Brooks. He does not get expelled, but he resigns in protest when the debate is attacking him for what he did. He resigns in protest and is immediately re-elected. And Laurence Keitt, who actually is censured, is immediately re-elected. So sometimes these violent acts are done partly for the base, for constituents, for \"the cause\". And sometimes that is indeed rewarded.\n\nSo historically, have censures been effective in changing lawmakers' behavior? Or do they sometimes encourage more of that same behavior?\n\nOn the one hand, you could say people are proving that they're willing to stand up for something, and for some populations, that gets applause. But the thing is, if people are really being offensive in some way or another, and they're not called on it ... that's basically an endorsement. And it's also a sign that the rules of Congress almost don't exist. They're just not in play.\n\nFor reasons of just upholding that there are lines that can be crossed, I think it's important for that to happen. The message of that kind of censuring is that this person did this thing and is accountable for that. And if you don't hold people accountable for their actions, that too is a passive stab at democracy.\n\nHow did the violence in Congress before the civil war both reflect and intensify the divisions in the country itself?\n\nThe violence in Congress reflects and affects the violence and politics throughout the nation at large in a few ways. By the time you get into the 1850s and you have the telegraph, which is spreading that kind of information very quickly around the nation more broadly than ever before, Americans can see that happening. So that sets a tone for politics all by itself.\n\nSome of it is playing to an audience. Depending on how it's acted out and the language that's used and the posturing that's taken by the members of Congress, it's deliberately intended to rile up Americans, which it does. That kind of violence can encourage violence, intensify political rhetoric [and] seemingly justify extremism and violence. It has an impact on the public.\n\nIf the public gets riled up, they're going to demand more things from their representatives - more violence, more extremism.\n\nGiven everything you know about the congressional violence that happened leading up the civil war, what do you think the censure of Gosar says about the direction of our country now?\n\nIt certainly reflects the tone and tenor of our politics right now, and that almost goes without saying. It gestures towards what's coming next because he's going to be rewarded for it in some ways, and because of that, there will be others that follow in that model.\n\nIt also shows a certain lack of respect for the institution of Congress. The censure doesn't matter clearly to this person. It's a moment that shows how far party is above government and above institutions of government and above institutional stability. That's not a very comforting thing to consider either.\n\nWe're in very unpredictable times. We never know from one moment to the next what direction things are going to lean towards. It's tempting to see an incident like [the Gosar censure] and assume from it we're doomed. We're in a moment of extreme contingency, and indeed things might become much worse.\n\nBut during that kind of moment of extreme contingency where anything can happen, those are also moments where it's possible to make positive change. It's possible in a moment of instability to really push for some kind of a change that isn't necessarily in the direction of force and violence, but is rather in a direction of inclusion and rights. I think we as Americans need to be thinking about that right about now."

I've got morons on my team.' I have to think anybody that would sit down with white nationalists and speak at their conference was certainly missing a few IQ points.\"\n\nGreene, from Georgia, and Gosar, from Arizona, spoke at the America First Political Action Conference, or AFPAC, organised by the far-right activist Nick Fuentes. Greene defended her attendance, saying she did not know Fuentes or endorse his views.\n\nCalls for the censure of the two Republicans , familiar from previous instances of extreme behaviour, rang out again on Saturday.\n\nAmmar Moussa, a spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee, said: \"In any other world, Greene speaking at a white supremacist conference where attendees have defended Vladimir Putin and praised Adolf Hitler would warrant expulsion from the caucus, to say nothing of her advocacy for violence and consistent antisemitism is disgusting.\n\n\"Quite simply, the longer [House Republican leader] Kevin McCarthy gives Marjorie Taylor Greene an unfettered platform and promises to elevate her, the more complicit he is.\"\n\nThe Republican party chair, Ronna McDaniel, said : \"White supremacy, neo-Nazism, hate speech and bigotry are disgusting and do not have a home in the Republican party.\"\n\nBut McDaniel and McCarthy lead a party in which the far right is strong, former president Donald Trump its figurehead.\n\nMcDaniel is Romney's niece, though she reportedly stopped using his name at Trump's request. On CNN, Romney mentioned McDaniel's statement about Greene and Gosar as well as strong words from Liz Cheney, the Wyoming Republican congresswoman and Trump critic.\n\n\"Talking about how repugnant these white nationalists are,\" Romney said, \"look, there's no place in either political party for this white nationalism or racism. it's simply wrong.\n\n\"Speaking of evil, it's evil as well. And, you know, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar, I don't know them.\"\n\nCheney is a stringent conservative but remains at odds with her party. She was not invited to CPAC, the larger conservative event in Florida at which Trump and Greene appeared.\n\nIn video posted online, Vaughn Hillyard, a reporter for NBC, asked CPAC organiser Matt Schlapp why Greene had been invited despite her long record of extremist behaviour and her participation in the white nationalist event.\n\n\"I think it's great that Marjorie Taylor Greene was on this stage because she was elected by her constituents to have a vote in Congress,\" Schlapp said .\n\n\"[House speaker] Nancy Pelosi decided to strip her of her rights as a congressperson to serve on these committees and Twitter has decided to shut her down.\"\n\nHillyard said : \"But you're inviting legitimacy to that white nationalist movement that was just down the road when a member of Congress from the Republican party appears at that event and you bring her here.\"\n\nSchlapp said : \"I'm providing legitimacy to you and your network by being allowed to be in this room. It's called the first amendment and you are a member of the press and you have a right to be in this room. If I had said you couldn't come into this room, how would that make America better?\"\n\nHillyard asked : \"Did you extend an invite to Liz Cheney?\"\n\nSchlapp said: \"No.\""

      "text": "'A core threat to our democracy': threat of political violence growing across US\n\nRepublicans' muted response to Paul Gosar's behavior has intensified fears about where incendiary rhetoric may lead\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez stood on the House floor and implored her colleagues to hold Paul Gosar accountable for sharing an altered anime video showing him killing her and attacking Joe Biden.\n\n\"Our work here matters. Our example matters. There is meaning in our service,\" Ocasio-Cortez said in her speech last week. \"And as leaders in this country, when we incite violence with depictions against our colleagues, that trickles down into violence in this country.\"\n\nHouse Republicans heard Ocasio-Cortez's impassioned plea and responded with a collective shrug. All but three Republican members voted against censuring Gosar and stripping him of his committee assignments, while every House Democrat supported the resolution.\n\nThe Gosar incident served as the latest data point in an alarming trend in American politics. In a year that began with a deadly insurrection at the US Capitol, lawmakers have seen a sharp rise in the number of threats against them. Republicans' muted response to Gosar's behavior has intensified fears about the possibility of more political violence in America in the months to come.\n\nJackie Speier, the Democratic congresswoman who spearheaded the effort to censure Gosar, warned that Republicans' refusal to hold him accountable could have dangerous repercussions.\n\n\"If you are silent about a member of Congress wanting to murder another member of Congress, even in a 'cartoon', you are inciting violence,\" Speier told the Guardian. \"And if you incite violence, it begets violence.\"\n\nThat cycle is already playing out in the halls of Congress. The US Capitol police reported earlier this year that the agency had seen a 107% increase in threats against members compared with 2020. The USCP chief, Tom Manger, has said he expects the total number of threats against members to surpass 9,000 this year, compared with 3,939 such threats in 2017.\n\nSome of those threats have been on vivid display in the past month. In addition to Gosar's violent video, the 13 House Republicans who voted in support of the bipartisan infrastructure bill earlier month have received threatening messages.\n\nRepresentative Fred Upton of Michigan publicly shared one such message, in which a man called the Republican congressman a \"fucking piece of shit traitor\". \"I hope you die. I hope everybody in your fucking family dies,\" the man said in the message.\n\nAnd those kinds of threats are not reserved solely for members of Congress. Election workers and school board members also say they are receiving more violent messages. According to an April survey commissioned by the Brennan Center for Justice, nearly one in three election officials are concerned about their safety while on the job.\n\nStephen Spaulding, senior counsel at the government watchdog group Common Cause, described such violent tactics as \"a core threat to our democracy\".\n\n\"The threat of violence is really to intimidate people from doing their jobs and upholding their oath of office,\" Spaulding said. \"When you start having these violent episodes enter the system, it is totally counter to the way that we are supposed to engage in open and fair debate about policy issues in this country.\"\n\nThere are already signs that fears over personal safety are pushing lawmakers out of office. When the Republican congressman Anthony Gonzalez announced in September that he would not seek re-election, he said his vote to impeach Donald Trump for inciting the insurrection had affected the lives of his family members.\n\nGonzalez told the New York Times that, at one point earlier this year, uniformed police officers had to escort him and his family through the Cleveland airport because of security concerns.\n\n\"That's one of those moments where you say, 'Is this really what I want for my family when they travel, to have my wife and kids escorted through the airport?'\" Gonzalez said.\n\nEven though threats are affecting their own caucus members, House Republicans rejected the opportunity to send a message by voting to censure Gosar. Instead, the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, attacked the censure resolution as a Democratic \"abuse of power\" and suggested he would award Gosar with \"better committee assignments\" whenever Republicans regain control of the chamber.\n\n\"He's got a number of radical extremists in his caucus that are very effective communicators to the right fringe, and he can't really rein them in because reining them in means they will attack him,\" Speier said. \"You might as well put a brass ring in Kevin McCarthy's nose because they're pulling him around.\"\n\nDr Joanne Freeman, a Yale history professor and author of The Field of Blood: Violence in Congress and the Road to Civil War, warned that McCarthy's response to Gosar's behavior may encourage similar incidents in the future.\n\nAfter all, there are other historical examples of lawmakers being rewarded for violent behavior, Freeman noted. After Congressman Preston Brooks attacked Senator Charles Sumner with a cane over his anti-slavery views in 1856, he resigned from the House but was then quickly re-elected by South Carolina voters.\n\n\"He's going to be rewarded for it in some ways, and because of that, there will be others that follow in that model,\" Freeman said. \"It's a moment that shows how far party is above government and above institutions of government and above institutional stability.\"\n\nWhile acknowledging the possibility of future violence within Congress, Freeman added that the Gosar incident could also provide an opportunity for a course correction in political discourse.\n\n\"We're in a moment of extreme contingency, and indeed things might become much worse,\" Freeman said. \"But during that kind of moment of extreme contingency where anything can happen, those are also moments where it's possible to make positive change.\"\n\nFor Speier, Gosar's behavior served as a reminder of how far some of her colleagues have strayed from their duties to constituents. The California congresswoman, who announced her retirement last week , urged fellow members to focus on advancing policy rather than spewing violent rhetoric to raise money and rack up retweets.\n\n\"I love this institution. It's such a privilege to serve,\" Speier said. \"We're given the opportunity to fashion legislation to make lives better for the American people. And that's what we should be doing.\""

      "text": "Congresswoman Jackie Speier: 'Republicans are about doing what's going to give them power'\n\nThe Democratic congresswoman talks about her effort to censure Paul Gosar, her retirement and the shifting dynamics of the House\n\nFor Jackie Speier, the growing threat of political violence in America is personal.\n\nBefore becoming a member of the House of Representatives in 2009, Speier served as a staffer to congressman Leo Ryan. When Speier joined Ryan for a 1978 trip to Guyana to investigate the Jonestown settlement, she was shot five times.\n\nSpeier survived the attack, but Ryan and four other members of their delegation did not.\n\nSo when one of her Republican colleagues recently shared a threatening video about the president and another House member, Speier knew she needed to act. The Democratic congresswoman spearheaded an effort to censure Paul Gosar, who had tweeted an altered anime video showing him killing Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking Joe Biden.\n\nThe censure resolution passed the House last week, in a vote of 223 to 207. All but three House Republicans voted against the resolution, with the minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, condemning the measure as a Democratic \"abuse of power\".\n\nThe Guardian spoke to Speier to discuss the censure resolution, her coming retirement and the shifting dynamics of the House as lawmakers face more threats of violence. The interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nWhy was it so important for the House to censure Gosar?\n\nThe ramping up of vitriol on the House floor has been demonstrable for a number of years now. It was like a match got lit during Donald Trump's presidency, and it was seen as benefiting members to be provocative and then fundraising off of statements they made on the House floor.\n\nIt's very clear that, if you are silent about a member of Congress wanting to murder another member of Congress, even in a \"cartoon\", you are inciting violence. And if you incite violence, it begets violence.\n\nSo that's why I felt so strongly that we had to draw the red line. This has got to be a red line. And obviously my colleagues agreed, and we passed the resolution.\n\nWe saw some of your Republican colleagues either trying to justify Gosar's behavior or downplay it. Do you feel like some of your colleagues have not learned the lessons of the Capitol insurrection, when we saw that violent rhetoric can escalate to potentially deadly violence?\n\nThe facts don't matter. That's the problem. The facts don't matter. I heard one of the Republicans on a show this morning say she thought it was reprehensible, but she voted against the censure because it also stripped him of his committee assignments. So they always will come up with a rationale to allow them to continue to follow the lead of former President Trump or Kevin McCarthy. It's not about doing what's right any more. It's about doing what's going to give them power.\n\nSpecifically in terms of Kevin McCarthy, do you think that his rationalization for this behavior makes it inevitable that this is going to happen again?\n\nHe's got a number of radical extremists in his caucus that are very effective communicators to the right fringe, and he can't really rein them in because reining them in means they will attack him. So they have become the face of the House Republicans. You might as well put a brass ring in Kevin McCarthy's nose because they're pulling him around.\n\nPolitics is politics, but we're talking about taking the life of another member of Congress. How is that not appropriate for censure?\n\nDoes it feel like there's a disconnect between Republicans' rationalizations and the very real violence we saw earlier this year [during the Capitol insurrection] that could have resulted in the death of a member?\n\nNot to mention the fact that they're eating their young. They've got one member, one of these fringe rightwing members, who was giving out the telephone numbers of members who voted for their districts and voted for what is a bipartisan infrastructure bill, and [Republican congressman Fred] Upton gets death threats .\n\nYou've got to have an alligator's skin to do this job. We know that. I've been doing this for 38 years. I'm very accustomed to it. I'm also accustomed to getting death threats. And some are seen as credible, and some are not.\n\nSo that happens. There has to be a repercussion for that. And, as someone said, if in corporate America, you put out an animated video killing one of your co-workers, you would be fired.\n\nThere's a lack of reality in Congress right now. And anything goes. The more hyperbolic you are, the more extremist you are, the more successful you are because it's all about raising money. Raising money gets you clout and power within the caucus.\n\nThey have made Minority Leader McCarthy impotent in terms of disciplining anyone in his caucus who strays, who crosses that red line.\n\nWhat is your response to suggestions that Republicans will strip Democrats of committee assignments when they come back into power?\n\nIf one of my colleagues put up an animated video or a tweet that said they wanted to kill a Republican colleague, I would introduce a censure motion for that. You cannot excuse away that kind of conduct. Someone is going to get injured or be killed. That's how serious that conduct was.\n\nYou have been in and around the House for decades now. Do you think that the increased number of threats against members has changed the dynamics of the House in any way?\n\nI think it's become a bloodsport. And if a bipartisan bill like the infrastructure bill that had bipartisan support in the Senate and has bipartisan support in the House is then turned on the members that worked in consensus-building, then that suggests that we don't want to legislate any more.\n\nI know that you announced your retirement this week. As you prepare for your next steps, would you say that this resolution was one way to protect the House as an institution?\n\nI love this institution. It's such a privilege to serve. And I think when you're in the heat of doing your everyday job here, you might lose sight of the fact that this is such a privilege. We're given the opportunity to fashion legislation to make lives better for the American people. And that's what we should be doing.\n\nWhen we get sidetracked into wanting to just disparage each other, then we're not doing our jobs.\n\nI introduced the resolution because it just hit me so dramatically. And it's yet again another example of women becoming the subject of attacks - physical attacks, psychological attacks - women of color in politics even more. I've worked on this issue for years now. And I see it as a way of silencing women and discouraging women from running for office.\n\nSo for all those reasons, it was really important to take action."

      "text": "This Republican Actually Wants To Put Convict Trump's Face On A $500 Bill\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nAround the same time that Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) was publicly slamming the Republican Party for its cult-like devotion to former President Donald Trump, one far-right Arizona lawmaker was busy finalizing legislation to honor the MAGA movement's leader.\n\nRep. Paul Gosar's new bill, dubbed the Treasury Reserve Unveiling Memorable Portrait (TRUMP) Act , would require the United States Treasury to print $500 bills with Trump's face on them. No joke.\n\nGosar rolled out the bill just days after Trump became the first U.S. president ever convicted of a crime. A New York jury last week found him guilty of 34 felonies in a state-level criminal case that centered on hush money payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels in 2016.\n\nGosar's bill to celebrate the former president in the form of legal tender would break with decades of tradition - and flout a 150-year-old federal law that prohibits living persons being featured on U.S. money.\n\nOn its website , the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco writes: \"To avoid the appearance of a monarchy, it was long-standing tradition to only feature portraits of deceased individuals on currency and coin. That tradition became law with an 1866 Act of Congress.\"\n\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution explained the 1866 law this way : \"Our Founding Fathers believed it was unpatriotic for living people's likenesses to be placed on money in circulation.\" The publication noted that President George Washington declined having his portrait on the silver dollar while he was alive, although he is now featured on both the $1 bill and the quarter.\n\nThe 1866 law has been ignored at times in the past, most notably when then-President Calvin Coolidge appeared on a commemorative half dollar minted for the 150th anniversary of American independence.\n\nBut Gosar isn't eyeing a commemorative coin. He's looking to put Trump's face on what would be the largest bill in print.\n\nThe U.S. government stopped printing larger denomination bills, including $500, $1,000, $5,000, and $10,000 notes, in 1945 and discontinued them altogether in 1969. The most recently minted $500 bills feature a portrait of the 25th U.S. president, William McKinley.\n\nIn a press release announcing his legislation, Gosar bemoaned so-called \"Bidenflation\" and argued $500 Trump bills would offer \"several practical advantages.\"\n\n\"First, larger-value currency will empower Americans with the freedom of more tangible options to save and exchange goods and services,\" Gosar said. \"Additionally, the absence of large-denomination currency issued by the Treasury encourages Americans to rely on digital banking, which faces greater vulnerability to surveillance and censorship.\"\n\nTrump notes would likely be sought after by collectors, Gosar added.\n\n\"Collectors often covet currency with unique designs and historical significance and bills featuring the very popular 45 th President will attract considerable attention from collectors,\" he said.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

In a piece on Thursday, Arizona Republic columnist EJ Montini wrote that the bill \"provides irrefutable proof that for some individuals - Gosar among them - Donald Trump is a cult.\"\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Greene also nabbed a seat on the Homeland Security Committee, and Gosar returned to a seat he'd occupied previously on the Natural Resources Committee.\n\nBoth representatives, who are staunch supporters of former President Donald Trump and critics of President Joe Biden, were removed from their respective committees in 2021 following their controversial actions and comments.\n\nIn February 2021, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives removed Greene from her committee assignments because of her past racist, antisemitic and violent remarks, including her declaration that she would have been armed and would have \"won\" the Jan. 6 insurrection . Later that year, Gosar tweeted an animated video that portrayed him killing his colleague Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and attacking Biden, which Democrats also deemed grounds for removal from his committees.\n\nAccording to NBC News , Republicans on the Homeland Security Committee will be focused on improving border security and investigating Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, whom GOP leaders have vowed to impeach . Meanwhile, the Republican-led Oversight and Accountability Committee intends to launch an investigation into Biden, and Greene appears eager to participate.\n\n\"Joe Biden, be prepared. We are going to uncover every corrupt business dealing, every foreign entanglement, every abuse of power, and every check cut for The Big Guy,\" Greene said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that the investigation won't stop at just the Biden family but also \"every bit of government being used to abuse the American people.\"\n\nGreene and Gosar's committee assignments are still awaiting ratification by the House Republican Conference, which will occur next week.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) blamed Boston Mayor Michelle Wu (D) of acting unconstitutionally because \"the federal government has jurisdiction and supremacy over all immigration laws.\"\n\nWu was quick to point out that that might be true ― if Congress were to actually pass some form of immigration reform.\n\n\"Respectfully, congressman, you could pass bipartisan legislation and that would be comprehensive immigration law,\" she said.\n\n\"The false narrative is that immigrants in general are criminals or immigrants in general cause all sorts of danger and harm,\" Wu continued. \"That is actually what is undermining safety in our communities.\"\n\n\"If you wanted to make us safe, pass gun reforms. Stop cutting Medicaid. Stop cutting cancer research. Stop cutting funds for veterans. That is what will make our city safe,\" she added.\n\nGosar appeared unprepared for the honest response.\n\n\"Yeah ... thank you,\" he said, smirking and shrugging. \"I yield back.\"\n\nIn 2024, Trump forced Republicans to kill a bipartisan border deal negotiated by President Joe Biden . Not because it was a bad deal, but because Trump cared more about denying Biden a political win than actually fixing the broken immigration process.\n\nInstead he's gone on to lie about immigrants and threaten them with mass deportation.\n\nMayors Brandon Johnson of Chicago, Mike Johnston of Denver and Eric Adams of New York, all Democrats , also testified Wednesday.\n\nRepublicans have threatened to withhold federal funding from the cities, and in January, acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove also threatened to prosecute state and local officials who don't cooperate with ICE.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Paul Gosar were spotted conversing on the House floor Tuesday afternoon, observers were curious to know what the New York Democrat and Arizona Republican could have to chat about so casually. After all, Gosar was stripped of his committee appointments in 2021 for posting an anime video of himself attacking and killing Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nThe topic at hand turned out to be what was playing out in front of them, as the new Republican majority attempted and failed to elect a House speaker. Without a House speaker, none of the representatives could be sworn in, and House business was at a standstill.\n\nOcasio-Cortez told MSNBC's Alex Wagner later Tuesday that Gosar had brought up the possibility of Republicans cutting a deal with Democrats that could secure the speakership for Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). Challenges brought by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and others meant that three rounds of voting on Tuesday failed to reach the necessary total to elect McCarthy.\n\nOcasio-Cortez said with a laugh: \"I think in chaos anything is possible, especially in this era.\" But she signaled that the possibility of a deal of any kind was not going to happen.\n\nShe explained how things happen in the House when there is no consensus.\n\n\"Sometimes the leadership of your party ― in this case, the Republican Party ― will be making claims in order to try to twist arms and get people in line, and a lot of times, information and truth is currency.\"\n\nShe continued: \"So, sometimes, to be able to fact-check some of the claims that McCarthy is making, whether Democrats are going to defect or not, et cetera, is important in order to keep him honest and to keep people honest in general.\"\n\nDemocrats rallied around Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) to lead their caucus back in November, and lined up behind him in Tuesday's speaker votes without issue. He is expected to formally become minority leader once the speakership is decided and lawmakers are sworn in.\n\n\"I think what was important today,\" Ocasio-Cortez continued, \"was to send the message we were united behind Hakeem Jeffries as the now-minority leader, or as leader of the Democrats, and that there would be no defections.\"\n\nGaetz was also caught on camera speaking with Ocasio-Cortez in what she described as a similar conversation .\n\nJeffries also said Tuesday evening that Democrats will not help Republicans navigate their own internal chaos.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "GOP Rep. Who Spoke At Pro-Hitler Event Goes After Ilhan Omar Because Of 'Anti-Semitism'\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost National Desk\n\nRep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), who for years has promoted and appeared with white nationalists, voted Thursday to remove Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) from the House Foreign Affairs Committee , citing... what he called \"her sustained racism and anti-semitism.\"\n\nOn that front, Gosar's own record is unparalleled: In February 2021, he spoke at a political conference hosted by the white nationalist Nick Fuentes ― known today as the political adviser of the antisemitic rapper Ye. At the event, Gosar praised the crowd, telling them that \"a nation without a people is not a nation.\"\n\nFuentes, following Gosar, told his audience: \"White people are done being bullied!\"\n\nThe following day, Fuentes posted a picture to his Twitter account of him and Gosar getting coffee together. A few days later, Gosar tweeted a meme that included the motto of Fuentes' white nationalist group.\n\nEven after a public outcry, Gosar appeared at the same conference a year later, this time in a pre-recorded video. (He subsequently said the appearance was due to a miscommunication .) At that conference, Fuentes remarked : \"Now, [the media is] going and saying, 'Vladimir Putin is Adolf Hitler,' as if that isn't a good thing.\"\n\nFollowing the event, Gosar claimed he was done \"dealing with Nick.\" But he wasn't: In September, he tweeted a link to a documentary about Fuentes, with a comment about \"the persecution against Christians and Conservatives by the Biden Regime.\" He eventually deleted the tweet.\n\nIn an email to constituents Thursday explaining his vote to boot Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee, Gosar falsely said the congresswoman \"has expressed a deep hatred for Jewish people and Israel.\"\n\n\"Representative Omar has pursued a reckless and fundamentally anti-American agenda while in the United States House of Representatives,\" Gosar wrote. \"She regularly engages with racists, supports and condones racism, and champions anti-American sentiments.\"\n\nGosar's email, and the Republican resolution he voted on to expel Omar from the committee, cited a handful of tweets and comments from the congresswoman, such as a tweet in which she said U.S. politicians' support for Israel was \"all about the Benjamins baby.\" (Omar later apologized for the remark.) Gosar also cited a public appearance in which Omar said, \"I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is OK for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country,\" comparing pro-Israel lobbying efforts to those of the National Rifle Association and the fossil fuel industry.\n\nGosar's ties to white nationalists go back years. In 2019, he was following explicit white nationalists on his personal Twitter page ― accounts with names like @TradNatWife88 (\"88\" is a common white nationalist code for \"Heil Hitler\"). One account that Gosar followed published tweets like \"We need a leader who can rile the masses of Whites with their eye's [ sic ] closed,\" and \"Wherever there's n[******] they'll be n[******].\"\n\nMore recently, Gosar has tweeted (and then deleted) support for former President Donald Trump's call for the \"termination\" of parts of the Constitution. He has also tweeted a video of an animated version of himself killing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Paul Gosar Says 'Destroy The FBI' Rhetoric Is Just A Way To 'Catch People's Attention'\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nWASHINGTON - Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) suggested this week that he doesn't really want to destroy the FBI, contrary to what he keeps saying on Twitter.\n\n\"Well, you know, you catch people's attention that way,\" Gosar said of his tweets in a brief interview with HuffPost on Wednesday.\n\nIn response to the FBI raid on former President Donald Trump's home in Palm Beach, Florida, last month, many Republicans criticized federal law enforcement, but none went as far as Gosar.\n\n\"We must destroy the FBI. We must save America,\" he tweeted on Aug. 8 , soon after Trump disclosed that the FBI had searched his property. \"I stand with Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nJust three days later, an armed Trump supporter tried to breach an FBI building in Ohio, ultimately dying in a shootout with police.\n\nEven some of Gosar's fellow Republicans have suggested that language like Gosar's went too far. On Aug. 12, Republicans on the House intelligence committee called a press conference to criticize the FBI, but Rep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio), the committee's top Republican, suggested that calls to defund or destroy the FBI were out of bounds.\n\n\"We support our men and women in uniform who are in law enforcement and we request that anybody who has made outrageous statements like that, that you question them and not us,\" Turner said.\n\nHowever, Turner and the other Republicans at that press conference spent very little time talking about the troubling incident at the FBI building in Ohio that had happened the day before. They devoted far more time to talking about the 2017 shooting of Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) at a congressional baseball practice and the Hillary Clinton email controversy.\n\nBy the time of the Mar-a-Lago raid, the National Archives had already said that Trump kept official documents that he was legally required to turn over to the Archives at the end of his term. And the Justice Department has since said in court that Trump may have obstructed investigators by moving material and intentionally misleading them about what remained.\n\nBut Gosar hasn't let up. Last week, for instance , he tweeted a call to \"Dismantle and Eliminate the FBI\" in response to Trump adviser Steve Bannon's unconfirmed claim that the FBI had raided the homes of dozens of Trump allies. (The New York Times reported this week that the Justice Department has sent out more than 40 subpoenas related to its investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection.)\n\nOn Wednesday, when HuffPost asked what he meant about destroying or eliminating the FBI, Gosar said he just wants people to be \"held accountable\" and that he wants \"new blood in the FBI,\" as in new personnel. And he suggested that Congress would achieve the changes through its regular spending prerogatives.\n\n\"I think the power of the purse will show its way,\" Gosar said.\n\nWhen asked whether he was talking about \"much less sweeping reform\" than actually eliminating the FBI, Gosar said he was trying to \"catch people's attention\" with the more bombastic rhetoric.\n\nBut Gosar and other Republicans could be playing with fire, as the FBI has said its agents have received an unprecedented wave of threats in the days following the Mar-a-Lago search. On Aug. 15, days after the Trump supporter in Ohio tried to storm an FBI building and was killed, the bureau arrested another Trump supporter for threatening to kill FBI agents .\n\nGosar said, essentially, that the FBI is asking for it.\n\n\"What's the FBI doing showing up at everybody's house as well?\" he said, in an apparent reference to Bannon's claim of mass raids. \"Coming from the West, the West was won, you know, not by the FBI.\"\n\nHuffPost at this point suggested that Gosar's meaning wasn't entirely clear.\n\n\"It's about the equal application of the law,\" he said.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Andy Biggs of Arizona, helped plan the January 6 event that culminated in a storming of the Capitol , according to Ali Alexander, a lead organizer of the gathering. Alexander, a pro-Trump personality , was an early founder of the \"Stop the Steal\" movement and helped bring together various right-wing factions around a mass event on January 6, aimed to coincide with objections to the counting of Electoral College votes.\n\nAlexander made his claim in three separate livestreams in late December, adding that Reps. Paul Gosar of Arizona and Mo Brooks of Alabama were also involved. \"We're the four guys who came up with a January 6 event,\" Alexander said. On December 8, the Arizona Republican Party boosted Alexander, asking supporters if they were willing to give their lives in the fight over the results of the presidential election.\n\nHis claim is also buttressed by a fourth video from a December 19 rally at the Arizona State Capitol, at which Alexander played a video that Biggs had supplied. In the video, Biggs mentions Brooks as his ally in the fight. Gosar spoke in person at the event.\n\nHere is Ali handing Gosar the mic at a stop the steal event. Video posted to Gosar's Parler account Nov. 30. https://t.co/QtJJ4DtvJc pic.twitter.com/lg41ex3GC4\n\n- Jason Paladino (@jason_paladino) January 8, 2021\n\nBiggs's connection to Alexander was reported on Sunday by the Arizona Republic, which quoted his spokesperson, Daniel Stefanski, denying any connection to Alexander. \"Congressman Biggs is not aware of hearing of or meeting Mr. Alexander at any point - let alone working with him to organize some part of a planned protest,\" Stefanski said . \"He did not have any contact with protestors or rioters, nor did he ever encourage or foster the rally or protests.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nGosar did not respond to inquiries from The Intercept.  Alexander did not respond to a text or phone call; his voicemail was full. Alexander, who adopted a new name after pleading guilty to felony property theft in 2007 and felony credit card abuse in 2008, has been suspended from Twitter and other platforms for his role in organizing the January 6 event. As the Daily Beast reported, he has said he has been unfairly blamed for the violence on January 6, and has gone underground.\n\nBrooks, after the event, sought to legitimize political violence in a radio interview .In a statement to The Intercept following publication, Brooks's office denied the congressman incited violence, writing in part: \"Congressman Brooks has no recollection of ever communicating in any way with whoever Ali Alexander is. Congressman Brooks has not in any way, shape or form coordinated with Ali Alexander on the January 6th 'Save America' rally. Congressman Brooks spoke at the 'Save America' rally at the invitation of the White House (the invitation was extended the day before), not anyone else.\"\n\nAlexander's contemporaneous claims have taken on new relevance as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has floated the possibility of expelling members of Congress who are found to have been involved in the riot. \"Your views on the 25th Amendment, 14th Amendment Section 3 and impeachment are valued as we continue,\" she wrote to her colleagues over the weekend.\n\nSection 3 of the 14th Amendment, ratified after the Civil War, reads:\n\nNo person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.\n\nAlexander made his comments in a livestream posted December 28. Jason Paladino, an investigator with the Project on Government Oversight, archived the video from Alexander's now-suspended account and provided it to The Intercept. \"I was the person who came up with the January 6 idea with Congressman Gosar, Congressman Mo Brooks, and then Congressman Andy Biggs. We four schemed up of putting maximum pressure on Congress while they were voting so that who we couldn't lobby, we could change the hearts and the minds of Republicans who were in that body hearing our loud roar from outside,\" Alexander said in the livestream.\n\nin case he takes the video down, here's the relevant section pic.twitter.com/IYiqxeX6Ch\n\n- Jason Paladino (@jason_paladino) January 8, 2021\n\nAlexander reiterated the claim of collaborating with Biggs, Gosar, and Brooks a second time, using almost identical language in a December 29 livestream similarly provided by Paladino, who has tracked Alexander. \"I'm the guy who came up with the idea of January 6 when I was talking with Congressman Gosar, Congressman Andy Biggs, and Congressman Mo Brooks. So we're the four guys who came up with a January 6 event - #DoNotCertify - and it was to build momentum and pressure, and then on the day change hearts and minds of congresspeoples who weren't yet decided, or saw everyone outside and said, 'I can't be on the other side of that mob,'\" Alexander said a week before the event he predicted would bring more than a million people to Washington, D.C.\n\nOn December 21, Alexander made the same claim on a livestream . \"We're working closely with Congressman Mo Brooks, we're working closely with Congressman Andy Biggs, and closely with, obviously, Congressman Paul Gosar, my great friend,\" Alexander said. \"I believe that the president should do something brave, I think the vice president should do something brave. I believe that that's how we maintain the White House. ... It's a moral imperative to maintain the White House.\"\n\nThe Office of Congressional Ethics has seen some of the claims made by Alexander and is looking into the connection between him, Gosar, Brooks, and Biggs, according to two sources familiar with the situation. The OCE was unable to confirm or deny whether any specific investigations are underway, in accordance with the office's rules.\n\nAt the December 19 rally, two days before that claim, Alexander more clearly delineated the different roles Biggs and Gosar were playing. \"Congressman Gosar has been the spirit animal of this movement, and he's helped out where he could. He's offered to call donors. We actually had our first D.C. march because he called me and he said, 'You need to go to the Supreme Court.' I said, 'All right, my captain,'\" Alexander told the audience at the Arizona State Capitol.\n\n\"One of the other heroes has been Congressman Andy Biggs. Now, when the good doctor Paul, now a friend, has been concentrating on the movement, Andy Biggs has been running ahead of him and whipping votes in Congress. So he stayed in Washington, D.C.,\" Alexander noted, explaining that Biggs had \"sent us a video.\"\n\nIn the video, Biggs tells the audience:\n\nI wish I could be with you today. I pledge to you that I'm going to keep fighting for President Trump. And when it comes to January 6, I'll be right down there in the well of the House with my friend from Alabama, Mo Brooks, and dozens of others who will join me as we look at some of the elections around the country and we say, \"How do you explain that?\" And more than that, we're going to stand up for this president and for the voters of America. That's legal; not only is it legal, that's constitutional; not only is it constitutional, it's the moral thing to do. And we're going to keep fighting. And I implore you to keep fighting too.\n\nWhen asked why Biggs would record a video for someone he doesn't know, Stefanski told The Intercept: \"Rep. Gosar's team asked for the video, and he provided it.\"\n\nOn the day of the riot, Gosar used his official Twitter account to call for peaceful protest, urging Trump supporters \"not to get carried away\" so no one gets hurt, while spreading an entirely different message on Parler, a right-wing social media platform created in opposition to Twitter. \"Americans are upset,\" he wrote, sharing a photo of the rioters climbing the Capitol walls.\n\nRep. Paul Gosar post via Parler on January 6, 2021. Rep. Paul Gosar post via Parler on Jan. 6, 2021. Screengrab: Parler\n\nRep. Paul Gosar post via Parler on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nAt the December 19 rally, Alexander also thanked Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward. \"I want to thank Chairwoman Kelli Ward and the Arizona Republican Party. I work in seven states, and there is no party like the Arizona GOP Party, so let's thank Kelli Ward,\" Alexander said. Ward spoke at the rally.\n\n\"Let me tell you an open secret. The president watches these rallies, and he's watching you today,\" Alexander said, leading the crowd variously in \"Fight for Trump,\" \"1776,\" and \"Christ is King\" chants.\n\nThat day, Donald Trump posted to his since-suspended Twitter account: \"Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!\"\n\nGosar tagged Alexander on Twitter twice on January 6, and tagged him repeatedly in his posts throughout November and December.\n\nBiden should concede.   I want his concession on my desk tomorrow morning. Don't make me come over there. #StopTheSteaI2021 @ali pic.twitter.com/E2kuoWPUVy\n\n- Paul Gosar (@DrPaulGosar) January 6, 2021\n\nAs the mob broke into the Capitol, Gosar was in the middle of his speech objecting to the certification of Arizona's Electoral College votes. Once the Capitol was cleared, Gosar continued to object, as blood dried on the marble floors just steps away.\n\nUpdate: January 12, 2021 This story has been updated with a comment Rep. Mo Brooks's office sent after publication. The full statement reads: \"Congressman Brooks has no recollection of ever communicating in any way with whoever Ali Alexander is. Congressman Brooks has not in any way, shape or form coordinated with Ali Alexander on the January 6th 'Save America' rally. Congressman Brooks spoke at the 'Save America' rally at the invitation of the White House (the invitation was extended the day before), not anyone else. Congressman Brooks never incited violence, as has been egregiously and falsely claimed by his political opponents and the Fake News Media who distort Congressman Brooks' remarks, take them out of context, and thereby sully Congressman Brooks' reputation for political advantage. As the words in the speech unambiguously reflect (see the very preceding sentence to the 'take name' sentence), Congressman Brooks gave his 'take names' remarks in the context of winning elections in 2022 and 2024 and sought to motivate despondent Republicans into seeking change at the ballot box in 2022 and 2024. The only action Congressman Brooks asked the rally attendees to undertake at the Capitol was to say the words 'USA.' Period.'\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "As Kyle Rittenhouse Walks Free, Republican Lawmakers Fight Over Who Loves Him the Most\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nAs many Americans feared that freeing Rittenhouse seemed to legitimize political violence, Republicans competed for the honor of offering him a job.\n\nThe reading of the verdict that set Kyle Rittenhouse free on Friday also acted as the starter's pistol in a depraved race among Republican members of Congress to see who could most excite the young vigilante's fans with the most ardent expression of support.\n\nRep. Paul Gosar, the Arizona extremist who helped plan the pro-coup January 6 rally, and shared an animated video fantasy of himself killing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, hailed the verdict by tweeting that he and Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida \"will arm wrestle\" to see which of them gets to offer Rittenhouse a Capitol Hill internship.\n\nEarlier this week, Gaetz had told Newsmax that \"Kyle Rittenhouse would probably make a pretty good congressional intern\" and suggested that his office might \"reach out to him to see if he'd be interested in helping the country in additional ways.\"\n\nRep. Madison Cawthorn, the North Carolina fabulist who also spoke at the January 6 rally in support of Donald Trump's attempted coup, upped the ante. \"Kyle Rittenhouse is not guilty, my friends,\" Cawthorn said with glee on Instagram, over on-screen text that urged Rittenhouse to contact him for an internship. \"You have a right to defend yourself,\" he added. \"Be armed, be dangerous, and be moral.\"\n\nMadison Cawthorn offers Kyle Rittenhouse \"an internship,\" says he isn't guilty, and tells followers to also \"be armed and dangerous.\" pic.twitter.com/m3EHnp5EOD\n\n- PatriotTakes ?? (@patriottakes) November 19, 2021\n\nJ.D. Vance, the formerly anti-Trump venture capitalist hoping to win the Republican nomination to represent Ohio in the Senate, had already described the teen gunman's trial as \" child abuse .\" On Friday, Vance tweeted that the trial was \"not impartial justice in a constitutional society; it was mob rule in a banana republic.\" He also attacked the prosecutor for having described the protesters who had tried to disarm Rittenhouse after he had killed a man and fled the scene as \"heroes.\"\n\nThe jury's verdict - that Rittenhouse broke no laws when he killed two men and wounded a third with the semiautomatic rifle he brought to a Black Lives Matter protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last year - has already stoked fears of more political violence to come.\n\nThe family of Anthony Huber, who was killed by Rittenhouse while attempting to disarm him, said in a statement that the outcome gave a green light to other politically motivated vigilantes. \"Today's verdict means there is no accountability for the person who murdered our son,\" Huber's parents wrote. \"It sends the unacceptable message that armed civilians can show up in any town, incite violence, and then use the danger they have created to justify shooting people in the street.\"\n\nOutside the courthouse in Kenosha, Wisconsin, where Kyle Rittenhouse was found not guilty of murder on Friday, Bishop Tavis Grant consoled Hannah Gittings, whose partner, Anthony Huber, was fatally shot by Rittenhouse last year as he tried to disarm the teen vigilante.\n\nThe fact that so many elected officials expressed glee over the jury's decision that an armed vigilante did nothing wrong by bringing a rifle to a racial justice protest, inciting resentment that spilled over into violence, alarmed many other Americans and dumbstruck observers watching from abroad.\n\n\"This is why many of us warned a Chauvin verdict was not the symbol of progress some wanted it to be,\" tweeted Brittany Packnett Cunningham, an activist who organized protests in Ferguson, Missouri, following the police shooting of Michael Brown. \"White supremacy has a set number of acceptable losses. Kyle Rittenhouse, and his Vigilante How-To example, simply was not one of them.\" The whole sequence of events,\" she added, \"was literally a vigilante and legal instruction manual for how to protect and defend white supremacy.\"\n\n\"It has never taken more than a whisper of approval to fan the flames of militant right action, and the Kenosha acquittal is a shout,\" observed Kathleen Belew, the co-editor of \"A Field Guide to White Supremacy.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe verdict was taken as evidence that demonstrators opposed to police violence cannot rely on the state to protect them from pro-police vigilantes like Rittenhouse. As the New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie wrote in the immediate aftermath of the shootings, \"We should also be troubled by police action, or the lack thereof, against armed militias. Tacit support from Kenosha police\" - like thanking Rittenhouse's group for being there, as an officer was caught on video doing that night - \"almost certainly contributed to the permissive environment that led to the shooting.\"\n\nJournalist Alex Yablon suggested that the Kenosha jury's verdict could be read as a tacit endorsement for armed militias to act on their desire to intimidate protesters whose politics they disagree with across much on the nation. \"Thirty-six states either explicitly allow concealed and/or open carry at rallies, or don't forbid guns in that setting - and also preempt localities from making their own rules keeping firearms away from demonstrations,\" Yablon reported for The Trace in 2017. \"Nine more states allow guns at protests, but give cities some leeway to make their own regulations. Only seven states, along with the District of Columbia, bar firearms at rallies.\"\n\nWatching from Europe, Paul Mason, the author of \"How to Stop Fascism,\" observed that \"the rise of political murders, unpunished by the courts, was a key stage in the fascist process\" in 1920s Italy, where Benito Mussolini took power with the support of the squadristi - paramilitary squads of teen vigilantes from the \"Voluntary Militia for National Security\" who carried guns, knives, and sticks and attacked rallies by political opponents they deemed \"pro-Bolshevik.\"\n\n\"Today,\" Mason wrote on Twitter , \"we witnessed that stage begin in the USA.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Six GOP House Members Who Need to Resign for Anti-Semitism Before Ilhan Omar\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nTrump wants Ilhan Omar to resign from Congress over purportedly anti-Semitic remarks. Why hasn't Trump asked for these six Republicans to resign, too?\n\nClockwise from top left: Matt Gaetz, Louie Gohmert, Paul Gosar, Kevin McCarthy, Steve Scalise, and Steve King. Photo: AP \"She should either resign from Congress or certainly resign from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\"\n\nClockwise from top left: Matt Gaetz, Louie Gohmert, Paul Gosar, Kevin McCarthy, Steve Scalise, and Steve King.\n\nSo declaimed President Donald Trump in the White House on Tuesday, as he denounced Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., for her \"terrible\" remarks and her \"lame\" apology.\n\nTo be clear: Omar apologized \"unequivocally\" for her two tweets on Israel and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, yet Trump has never apologized for any of his bigoted, sexist, racist, Islamophobic, and - yes - anti-Semitic remarks.\n\nThere is a bigger issue here, though. Trump said that \"anti-Semitism has no place in the United States Congress.\" I agree with him. But here's his problem: The modern GOP is riddled with bigots, Islamophobes, and anti-Semites.\n\nIf the president wants Omar to resign from Congress over alleged anti-Semitism, here are six Republican members of the House, including the two most senior members of the GOP leadership, who need to resign first.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, representative for California's 23rd Congressional District, has promised to \"take action this week\" against Omar over her tweets.\n\nThis is the same McCarthy who took to Twitter in October 2018 to accuse three Jewish billionaires - George Soros, Tom Steyer, and Michael Bloomberg - of trying to \"buy\" the midterms. He posted his tweet just a day after Soros received a pipe bomb at his home in New York.\n\nSteyer called the tweet \"straight-up anti-Semitic.\" McCarthy, though, continues to refuse to apologize for it, saying he did nothing wrong. So why did he delete it? And why isn't Trump calling on him to resign from Congress too?\n\nEarlier this week, Steve Scalise, the House Minority Whip and representative for Louisiana's 1st Congressional District, demanded that Democratic Party leaders \"remove [Omar] from the Foreign Affairs Committee\" over her \"disgraceful anti-Semitic remarks.\"\n\nYet, in 2002, Scalise, then a Louisiana state representative, attended and spoke at a convention of the white supremacist European American Unity and Rights Organization, a group founded by David Duke. You remember Duke, right? The Holocaust-denying former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan who has been described by the Anti-Defamation League as \"perhaps America's most well-known racist and anti-Semite.\"\n\nScalise later said he \" regretted \" - but did not technically apologize for - attending the EURO event. When Louisiana-based political reporter Stephanie Grace first met Scalise, he likened himself to Duke. Grace recalled , \"He told me he was like David Duke without the baggage.\"\n\nWhy is Scalise still in Congress?\n\nRep. Louie Gohmert represents Texas's 1st Congressional District and is a darling of the tea party.\n\nIn December, he appeared on the Fox Business channel to discuss Google, but then decided to pivot and attack - yep, you guessed it - the right's favorite Jewish billionaire.\n\nHoly crap!\n\nAppearing on Fox Biz, Louie Gohmert says \"George Soros is supposed to be Jewish but you wouldn't know it from the damage he inflicted on Israel and the fact that he turned on fellow Jews & helped take the property that they owned.\"\n\nStuart Varney quickly moves on pic.twitter.com/P4KUjOVnKb\n\n- Justin Baragona (@justinbaragona) December 6, 2018\n\n\"George Soros is supposed to be Jewish, but you wouldn't know it from the damage he's inflicted on Israel,\" Gohmert said. \"And the fact that he turned on fellow Jews and helped take the property that they owned. It's the same kind of thing.\"\n\nThis ludicrous and anti-Semitic claim that Soros helped \"take the property\" of fellow Jews during World War II has been repeatedly and thoroughly debunked . Soros, for the record, was 14 years old at the end of the war.\n\n\"Congressman Louie Gohmert for some reason went out of his way to bring up George Soros and made unsubstantiated and false allegations against him,\" host Stuart Varney later announced , live on air. \"I want to make clear those views are not shared by me, this program, or anyone at Fox Business.\" How anti-Semitic and unhinged do you have to be for a Fox host to have to loudly disown you?\n\nAnd why is Gohmert still a member of Congress?\n\nI've referred elsewhere to Rep. Matt Gaetz, who was elected to the House of Representatives from Florida's 1st Congressional District in 2016, as \"the most despicable and shameless member of the United States Congress.\"\n\nYou want anti-Semitism? Where to begin with Gaetz? He invited the notorious Holocaust denier Chuck Johnson* to be his guest at the State of the Union and later defended Johnson: \"He's not a Holocaust denier; he's not a white supremacist. Those are unfortunate characterizations of him.\"\n\nHe has appeared on Alex Jones's \"Infowars\" show. Jones has said that \"it's not that Jews are bad, it's just they are the head of the Jewish mafia in the United States. They run Uber, they run the health care, they're going to scam you, they're going to hurt you.\"\n\nHe suggested the caravan of migrants that set out from Central America in October 2018 was funded by George Soros, who might be \"giving cash 2 women & children 2 join the caravan & storm the US border.\"\n\nBREAKING: Footage in Honduras giving cash 2 women & children 2 join the caravan & storm the US border @ election time.

Matt Gaetz (@RepMattGaetz) October 17, 2018\n\nTrump has called Gaetz \"one of the finest and most talented people in Congress.\" Why hasn't he called on the Florida representative to resign over anti-Semitism?\n\n\"A newcomer member of Congress has apologized for her remarks,\" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., belatedly defending Omar from Republican attacks on Wednesday. \"It took them what, 13 years to notice Steve King?\"\n\nPelosi is correct. In January, House Republicans agreed to remove Rep. Steve King from two House committees after the Iowa Republican was quoted telling the New York Times, \"White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?\"\n\nThe GOP has since tried to draw an absurd and offensive comparison between King and Omar - aided and abetted by irresponsible members of the media - while demanding credit for taking action against King. But King has a long history of white nationalism, Islamophobia, and anti-Semitism that was ignored and overlooked by House Republicans - and a GOP presidential candidate ! - for years. \"Steve King Is A White Supremacist, And The GOP Doesn't Care,\" read a HuffPost headline in the summer of 2018.\n\nLong before his racist remarks to the New York Times, King retweeted a neo-Nazi. He sat on a panel with white nationalists. He praised both the German and Austrian far right. According to the ADL , he even \"denigrated the Jewish history of the Holocaust.\"\n\nWhy is there a place for him in the United States Congress?\n\nRep. Paul Gosar, the Republican who represents Arizona's 4th Congressional District, has claimed that the far-right rally held in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017 - at which marchers chanted \"Jews will not replace us\" - was \"created by the left\" and led by an \"Obama sympathizer.\" He has also suggested that Soros funded the event and falsely claimed that the Jewish billionaire \"turned in his own people to the Nazis.\"\n\nIn fact, Gosar is so brazen in his conspiratorial, anti-Jewish bigotry that his own family has felt the need to publicly denounce him. \"We are aghast that Paul has sunk so low that he now spews the most despicable slander against an 87-year-old man without a shred of proof,\" a letter signed by seven of his siblings said in October 2017. \"It is extremely upsetting to have to call you out on this, Paul, but you've forced our hand with your deceit and anti-Semitic dog whistle.\"\n\nIn October 2018, Gosar's brother David went even further, describing the representative's rhetoric as having \"helped feed the anti-Semitism that just resulted in the murder of 11 people in a Jewish synagogue and an attempt on Mr. Soros's life.\"\n\nWhen will Gosar be quitting the House?\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\n\"Fundamentally,\" as the prominent Jewish-American journalist Peter Beinart observed on Twitter , \"the furor over @IlhanMN's tweets isn't about policing bigotry or even anti-Semitism. It's about policing the American debate over Israel.\" I would go further: It's also about smearing and demonizing women of color, especially Muslim women of color , in the Democratic Party.\n\nRepublicans don't give a damn about anti-Semitism. They just don't care. And we'll know for sure that they do when they ask these six white Republican men to resign from Congress.\n\nJust don't hold your breath.\n\n*Update: February 16, 2019\n\nAfter publication, Charles Johnson told The Intercept that he does not deny the holocaust occurred, and that his Reddit post suggesting that he does was meant only to test the platform's free-speech algorithm.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "As Republicans Thirst for War With Mexico, Democrats Push to Make Them Vote on It\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nPopulist Republicans' response to the new war powers resolution highlights the growing pains of their anti-war coalition with progressive Democrats.\n\nAs invading Mexico becomes a mainstream Republican Party position, a group of Democratic lawmakers introduced a measure on Thursday that would bar a U.S. president from unilaterally taking military action against the country.\n\nThe response to the war powers resolution from the office of Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla. - who has led recent efforts to reduce the U.S. military's foreign entanglements - highlights populist Republicans' growing pains in their emerging anti-war coalition with progressive Democrats.\n\nAt first, Gaetz's office told The Intercept that he would oppose the amendment. In a follow-up statement attributed to the lawmaker, a spokesperson wrote: \"Mexico is a captive narco state. I support the amendment and support passing an Authorized Use of Military Force against Mexico.\"\n\nThe measure was introduced by Democratic Reps. Jesús \"Chuy\" García of Illinois; Joaquin Castro of Texas; and Nydia Velázquez of New York as an amendment to the 2024 Department of Defense appropriations bill.\n\nThe amendment draws on the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which was established to limit the president's authority to wage war . It would bar the use of the military budget with respect to Mexico without congressional authorization, \"including for the introduction of United States Armed Forces into hostilities in Mexico, into situations in Mexico where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, or into Mexican territory, airspace, or waters while equipped for combat.\"\n\nGarcía told The Intercept that the amendment was spurred in part by the \"escalating chorus of Republican calls to invade Mexico.\"\n\n\"Armed interventions and the humanitarian crises they inevitably engender are central reasons why people leave their home countries in the first place,\" García said. \"Invading Mexico would endanger a key partner, increase the chaos in which cartels thrive, and force large numbers of people to come to our border fleeing violence - far from addressing the challenges that Republicans purport to care about.\"\n\nDonald Trump has led the calls for war, enlisting advisers to come up with ways to attack Mexican drug cartels - with or without Mexico's permission . Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis promised he would send military forces to Mexico on \"day one\" if he is elected president. Vivek Ramaswamy, the businessman-turned-presidential-hopeful, said he would use \"military force to decimate the cartels, Osama bin Laden-style, Soleimani-style\" in the first six months of his presidency. Former CIA agent Will Hurd - who at one point was the only Black Republican in the House - said this week that he wants to \"dismantle cartel and human smuggling networks by treating them the same way we treated the Taliban and Al Qaeda.\"\n\nMeanwhile in Congress, 21 Republicans - led by Reps. Dan Crenshaw and Michael Waltz - introduced legislation in January to authorize the use of military force against Mexican cartels. In March, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., announced he would introduce legislation to \"set the stage\" for military force in Mexico. And House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer said it was a \"mistake\" that then-President Trump didn't move forward with his reported hopes to \"shoot missiles into Mexico to destroy the drug labs,\" and then lie and pretend the U.S. was not behind the attack.\n\nVelázquez said in a statement that military operations in Mexico would be an \"unmitigated disaster.\" Before the idea goes any further, she added, \"we need levelheaded policymakers to speak up and clarify that Congress will not support this. This amendment will ensure that no funding is allocated to these extreme policies.\"\n\nOver the last several years, congressional progressives have brought forward a number of war powers resolutions to force lawmakers to contend with U.S. entanglements abroad. In 2019, Congress passed a bipartisan resolution to stop U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, only for Trump to veto it. (Last year, Sen. Bernie Sanders unsuccessfully tried to revive the effort. )\n\nEarlier this year, Gaetz introduced two separate war powers resolutions, both of which garnered significant GOP support but ultimately failed. Fifty-two Republicans voted in favor of his resolution directing the president to remove all forces from Somalia , and 47 did the same with regard to Syria . The concern with the haphazard use of military force, however, may not extend to Mexico.\n\nThe Intercept contacted 18 House Republicans who have previously supported war powers resolutions. Most did not respond to questions whether Congress would need to authorize war with Mexico.\n\n\"Many Trump-aligned Republicans have rightly been adamant that only Congress can authorize war and military action. Dozens of them have voted to withdraw U.S. troops from unauthorized wars in Syria, Somalia, and Yemen,\" said Erik Sperling, executive director of the advocacy organization Just Foreign Policy. \"It would be a scandal if those who want a war in Mexico would now allow a future President to violate the Constitution and wage unauthorized war. They should support this important Garcia-Castro amendment and make clear that any future president will have to come to Congress before taking us to war in Mexico or anywhere else.\"\n\nOriginal reporting.

Instead of addressing the necessity of congressional authorization for use of military force in Mexico, he attacked the Biden administration. \"Joe Biden and the incompetent Secretary Mayorkas are complicit in their failure to protect Americans from the invasion along the southern border. I've repeatedly said that we must defend our border by any and all legal means necessary, including deploying our military,\" said Gosar, who voted in favor of the war powers resolutions for Somalia and Syria. \"Every member of congress should vote and be on record of supporting efforts to secure our border or continue to support this invasion.\"\n\nCrenshaw's office pointed to his bill from January about authorizing force against Mexican cartels and did not respond to a question about the Democrats' amendment.\n\nTennessee Rep. Tim Burchett's office did not speak to his stance on the amendment. \"Since it would currently require Congressional authorization, Congressman Burchett would not support changing the status quo to give the current president more unilateral decision-making authority in this area.\"\n\nNew York Rep. George Santos was more cautious than his Republican colleagues. \"Of course we want congressional authorization for any military action,\" said Santos, who also voted in favor of the war powers resolutions for Somalia and Syria. \"However militarization of the immigration crisis should be an absolute last resort.\"\n\nCongress is set to debate the appropriations bill when lawmakers return to Washington in September.\n\nWAIT!

Not a chance, she told him.\n\nOpponents of Rep. Kevin McCarthy's bid for the House speakership are digging in after a tense discussion on the House floor between Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.\n\nThe pair's conspicuous exchange in the back of the chamber on the first day of the 118th Congress was caught on C-SPAN - and noted by many members in the building. Thanks to Gaetz and his far-right allies, McCarthy, a California Republican, failed to win the speakership on the first round of voting.\n\nGaetz told Ocasio-Cortez that McCarthy has been telling Republicans that he'll be able to cut a deal with Democrats to vote present, enabling him to win a majority of those present and voting, according to Ocasio-Cortez. She told Gaetz that wasn't happening, and also double-checked with Democratic party leadership, confirming there'd be no side deal.\n\nWhat happened here?

Hakeem Jeffries of New York won all 212 of his party's votes, a show of unity that, if it holds, requires McCarthy to win over all but four of his colleagues.\n\nGaetz, who has shown a willingness to break with the GOP establishment, said that his crew of McCarthy opponents was dug in and would continue to resist him, adding that McCarthy has been threatening opponents with loss of committee assignments. A private gathering of Republicans ahead of the vote had been heated, multiple sources said. (Gaetz did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)\n\nMcCarthy and Gaetz presented their positions in dueling press conferences Tuesday morning. McCarthy said that Gaetz and his allies had requested plum committee assignments in exchange for supporting his speaker bid. McCarthy also accused Gaetz of telling Republican members that he was willing to elect Jeffries as speaker rather than accede to McCarthy. Gaetz told reporters that he and his allies didn't trust McCarthy.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.

All 19 McCarthy opponents voted for Jordan in the second round, leaving McCarthy again at 203 votes - 15 short of what he needed.\n\nRep. Paul Gosar , R-Ariz. another McCarthy opponent, also huddled with Ocasio-Cortez in the chamber, where they discussed the possibility of adjourning the House. (Gosar did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)\n\nIn the first round, McCarthy won just 203 votes, losing 19 of his colleagues. McCarthy has been insistent on remaining in session, as have his opponents. Adjourning without choosing a speaker would be embarrassing to Republicans but might also give time for McCarthy to break the opposition one by one.\n\nOcasio-Cortez was noncommittal on the tack, as an adjournment strategy would require party leadership.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Conservatives Only Care About the Incarcerated When It Comes to the Capitol Rioters\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nReps. Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene decried jail conditions in D.C. but remain silent about a settlement in Prince George's County.\n\nSeveral members of the Republican congressional delegation were invited to Saturday's \"Justice for J6\" rally in Washington, D.C., an event professing support for the more than 570 people arrested so far in relation to the January 6 attack on the Capitol. The gathering, organized by a group called Look Ahead America , drew a few hundred people and was guarded by a similar number of police in riot gear. With dozens of reporters, at least two GOP congressional candidates, and zero sitting members of Congress in attendance, the event seemed to fall short of the manufactured outrage that preceded it.\n\nConservatives have expressed newfound concern for incarcerated people in the past nine months, as those jailed for involvement in the storming of the Capitol report inhumane conditions and treatment. On July 24, right-wing Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz of Florida, Louie Gohmert of Texas, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, and Paul Gosar of Arizona wrote a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland requesting a meeting to discuss the treatment of Capitol rioters at Washington, D.C.'s Central Detention Facility, expressing concerns about allegations of abuse and the validity of solitary confinement. Five days later, the members showed up at the jail with camera crews from the far-right outlets One America News Network and Right Side Broadcasting Network. When jail officers turned them away, the representatives claimed they were \"locked out.\" The officers said they were obstructing the facility's entrance.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe episode brought a telling admission from Greene: On a live broadcast , she asked Gohmert what would have happened if they had been at the jail, where conditions have long been the subject of complaints, \"just to check on the entire population?\" - rather than exclusively on the Capitol rioters. (Gohmert quickly tried to correct her.) Long before Republicans took notice, Covid-19 had prompted 23-hour-a-day lockdowns and allegations of mass solitary confinement at the D.C. jail. And just 15 miles away, the situation was even worse: At the Department of Corrections in nearby Prince George's County, Maryland, conditions have been deteriorating for over a year, with similar 23-hour lockdowns and solitary confinement.\n\nUnlike the D.C. jail, which lifted its lockdown in late April, the one at Prince George's is ongoing. (A spokesperson for the jail denied that its policies constitute a lockdown.) The incarcerated population in Prince George's County is more than 20 times the size of the group being held in D.C. for the January 6 attacks - 853 people compared to 37 - but conservative outcry has been absent for the larger population.\n\nConditions at Prince George's have been so undeniably bad that they prompted a class-action lawsuit last year, which the county settled on August 23 after paying more than $81,400 of taxpayer money for defense from the private corporate litigation firm Maynard Cooper & Gale. Instead of a monetary award, the class - which named eight men but included everyone detained at the jail during the coronavirus pandemic - requested that the county Department of Corrections be required to take necessary steps to ensure the health and safety of incarcerated people.\n\nThe county agreed in the August settlement to test vulnerable groups once a month for Covid-19, provide each person with a hygiene kit, follow guidance for correctional facilities from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and allow an independent medical expert to conduct inspections of the jail. The settlement terms will apply for just four months, with the possibility to extend up to six if there is evidence of noncompliance. On September 9, plaintiffs in the case sent a notice to the Department of Corrections listing areas in which they identified noncompliance, including insufficient testing, people in medical isolation not given access to commissary, lack of access to weekly laundry, inconsistent receipt of out-of-cell time, and additional concerns related to the spread of Covid-19: staff not wearing masks, improper screening of new entries, and overpopulation. On September 10, Courtwatch PG, an advocacy group that monitors conditions in the jail, announced that it had been informed of another Covid-19 outbreak at the facility. Plaintiffs had requested a meeting with the county to discuss areas of noncompliance, but on September 16, lawyers from Maynard Cooper & Gale denied them in a written response .\n\nPrince George's County, one of Maryland's majority-Black counties, saw some of the highest rates of cases and deaths from Covid-19 in the state last year. Under pandemic-related restrictions , the county jail has been under lockdown for 17 months; for at least nine of them, the incarcerated population has far exceeded the reduced capacity the county achieved last July. (The jail normally has a capacity of 1,524; under pandemic protocols its population was reduced to roughly one-third of that, according to plaintiffs, Courtwatch PG, and county press releases . The Department of Corrections denied that it had reduced capacity due to Covid-19.) Even as the number of people in the Prince George's County jail has fluctuated, conditions in the facility have stayed largely the same. Almost a year and a half after the plaintiffs filed suit, the county has agreed to start making changes - but advocates say the settlement terms cover the bare minimum of what the jail should be doing.\n\nStarting early last April, people incarcerated in Prince George's County were effectively held in unconstitutional solitary confinement, allowed to leave their cells for one to two hours a day. Plaintiffs in the class-action suit claimed that the Department of Corrections violated incarcerated people's constitutional rights by keeping them in unsanitary conditions, denying them medical attention, and failing to provide access to basic hygienic supplies like soap. A subset of the class also asked the department to consider release for older people or people with underlying conditions that increased their risk of catching or dying from Covid-19. In the suit, they wrote that the jail had refused to release people who tested positive for Covid-19, keeping them instead in \"filthy isolation cells, where the walls are covered in feces, mucus, and blood,\" and \"they are barely monitored and receive no real treatment.\"\n\nIn court, Maynard Cooper & Gale lawyers representing the county and attorneys from the Prince George's County Office of Law presented a rosy picture of conditions at the jail. \"There is no evidence that any of named Plaintiffs suffered any actual harm,\" county attorneys wrote in filing last April. \"Currently, the virus appears to have been contained and plaintiffs have access to a medical staff 24/7 ready and able to diagnose and treat them in the event that they contract the virus. If need be they can be sent to the hospital at no expense to them. They are provided with cleaners, the common areas are wiped down constantly, and the charges against them are serious crimes against persons. They will not suffer irreparable harm. The hold on their liberties, albeit in a jail setting and necessarily more severe, mirror many of the ones the outside world is currently experiencing.\"\n\nBut that portrait wasn't reflective of reality, said Carmen Johnson, director of Courtwatch PG. \"That's why the lawsuit was filed,\" Johnson said, \"because they acted like it was a joke.\"\n\nDepartment of Corrections spokesperson Andrew Cephas told The Intercept that the jail was not put on lockdown, that it ensured availability of hygienic items, and that housing units rotated recreational schedules at the beginning of the pandemic and were given increased recreation time. While the Department of Corrections charges people $4 for nonemergency medical visits, Cephas said that even if someone has no money in their account, they are still seen by medical staff.\n\n\"There would be minimal costs associated with complying with the requests for release,\" Cephas said. \"No one will be released without an order of the court, which costs the Department of Corrections nothing.\" There may be added expenses related to ensuring the safety of people held at the facility as far as Covid-19 testing, extra soap, personal protective equipment, hand sanitizer, and educational posters, he added, \"but these additional Covid-19 related costs have not been quantified.\"\n\nRioters clash with police and security forces as people try to storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, in Washington, D.C., some of the 37 people being held in relation to the January 6 attacks were placed in \" restrictive housing \" separate from the general jail population. Asked if that was still the case, D.C. Department of Corrections Director of Strategic Communications Keena Blackmon said the residents \"are housed according to DOC policies and procedures and the housing units may vary.\" A July analysis by the Washington Post found that 13 percent of January 6 defendants were held in pretrial detention, compared with 75 percent of federal defendants held pretrial across the country. In the Prince George's County jail, the proportion of people detained pretrial is closer to 96 percent.\n\nBlackmon added that the jail is no longer operating with a 23-hour-a-day \"medical stay in place\" in effect, but did not say how many hours each day people were allowed out of their cells.\n\n\"It is the commitment of DC Department of Corrections that residents held in our custody are treated with dignity and respect,\" Quincy Booth, director of the department, said in a statement. Booth added that all incoming detainees are required to complete a 14-day quarantine and said people are provided with out-of-cell time, recreation, and visitation as permissible by Covid-19 restrictions or the terms of their confinement.\n\nLegislators who took up the cause of the jailed Capitol rioters have otherwise gone quiet. And it appears that they never followed the cases they once opined about with much regularity - one defendant the lawmakers referenced in their July letter had been released in April.\n\nEven as conservative groups and politicians draw attention to the treatment of detained January 6 rioters, the burst of public attention to jail conditions that emerged early in the pandemic has for the most part leveled off. Absent public scrutiny, incarcerated people still languish under inhumane conditions across the country, and Covid-19 cases continue to spike. While the majority of incarcerated people have been fully vaccinated - average rates are higher than among the general population - vaccination rates among corrections staff are much lower . At New York City's Rikers Island jail complex, where Covid-19 cases are once again on the rise, 11 people have died this year, including five people who died by suicide. The latest person to die was 41-year-old Isa Abdul Karim, who lost his life Sunday after spending only 32 days behind bars, 10 of them in a crowded intake pen where he contracted Covid-19. (The official cause of death has not been announced.) The death toll is the facility's largest in years.\n\nFreedom of movement can sometimes mean the difference between life and death. A push to release people being held for nonviolent offenses and lessen the use of cash bail led numerous cities to release thousands of people from prisons and jails early in the pandemic, but the number of people in prisons and jails started climbing again shortly after those initial releases, and many facilities have since surpassed the number of people they held at the height of the pandemic. Prince George's Department of Corrections is one of them.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "The One Thing Pope Francis Could Say That Would Truly Stun Congress\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe Pope's critique of the world is so radical that many Americans, members of Congress in particular, might not even understand what he's saying.\n\nThere are many things Pope Francis could say in his Thursday address to Congress that would make its members uncomfortable. Rep. Paul Gosar, a Republican Catholic from Arizona, has already announced that he's refusing to attend because the Pope may urge action on global warming. The Pope could also strongly criticize capitalism, as he did in great detail in his 2013 apostolic exhortation The Joy of the Gospel .\n\nBut the Pope's critique of the world has an even more radical component, one that's gotten little notice in the United States - maybe because it's so radical that many Americans, members of Congress in particular, might not even understand what he's saying.\n\nAnd what Francis is saying is that capitalism and our growing environmental disasters are rooted in an even older, larger problem: centuries of European colonialism. Moreover, he suggests this colonialism has never really ended, but merely changed forms - and much of U.S. foreign policy that's purportedly about terrorism, or drugs, or corruption, or \"free trade,\" is actually colonialism in disguise.\n\nThat's a perspective that no one in Congress - from Ted Cruz to Bernie Sanders or anyone in between - is going to get behind.\n\nThe Pope's most extensive denunciation of colonialism is probably his speech last June at the World Meeting of Popular Movements (an event nurtured by the Vatican at the Pope's initiative ) in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. It's genuinely startling. Read this and try to imagine what would happen if it were spoken at the U.S. Capitol:\n\nThe Earth, entire peoples and individual persons are being brutally punished. And behind all this pain, death and destruction there is the stench of what Basil of Caesarea called \"the dung of the devil.\" ... Once capital becomes an idol and guides people's decisions, once greed for money presides over the entire socioeconomic system, it ruins society, it condemns and enslaves men and women. ...\n\nLet us always have at heart the Virgin Mary, a humble girl from small people lost on the fringes of a great empire. ... Mary is a sign of hope for peoples suffering the birth pangs of justice. ...\n\nWe see the rise of new forms of colonialism, which seriously prejudice the possibility of peace and justice. ... The new colonialism takes on different faces. At times it appears as the anonymous influence of mammon: corporations, loan agencies, certain \"free trade\" treaties, and the imposition of measures of \"austerity,\" which always tighten the belt of workers and the poor. ...  At other times, under the noble guise of battling corruption, the narcotics trade and terrorism - grave evils of our time, which call for coordinated international action - we see states being saddled with measures which have little to do with the resolution of these problems and which not infrequently worsen matters.\n\nMoreover, the location of the event and the Pope's speech was certainly not random. Bolivia today is an international symbol of both the evils of European colonialism and resistance to it, with history running from the founding of La Paz in 1548 to right now.\n\nFor instance, while it's almost completely unknown in Europe and the U.S., an estimated 8 million indigenous Bolivians and enslaved Africans died mining silver for Spain from the Bolivian mountain Cerro Rico - or as it's known in Bolivia, \"The Mountain That Eats Men.\" Potosí, the city that grew up around Cerro Rico, is now extraordinarily polluted , and the mountain is still being mined, often by children . On the conquerors' side of the ledger, Potosí was the source of tens of thousands of tons of silver, leading to the Spanish phrase vale un potosi - i.e., worth a fortune. (Some also believe the U.S. dollar sign originated from the design of coins minted there .)\n\nMore recently, in a faint echo of Potosí, the International Monetary Fund tried to force the Bolivian city of Cochabamba to lease its water system to a consortium of international investors. Enormous, successful protests helped make then-Congressman Evo Morales famous - enough so that he went on to become Bolivia's first-ever indigenous president.\n\nMorales kicked out the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency in 2008, and now the U.S. has secretly indicted several Bolivian officials connected to his administration - under, as the Pope might put it, \"the noble guise of battling the narcotics trade.\" The U.S. also appears to have been behind the forcing down of Morales' presidential plane as it flew across Europe from Moscow, because the U.S. believed Morales might have had Edward Snowden onboard.\n\nThis history is why the Pope could tell Bolivians, \"I do not need to go on describing the evil effects of this subtle dictatorship: you are well aware of them.\"\n\nAnd whether white people are ready to hear it or not, Bolivia's experience is the norm across the planet, not the exception. It's why President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner of Argentina said what happened to Morales' plane was \"the vestiges of a colonialism that we thought was completely overcome.\" Or why most of the world sees the Israel-Palestine conflict as not about democracy vs. terrorism, but about colonialism. Or why it sees the Trans-Pacific Partership as not about free trade vs. protectionism, but about colonialism. Or why it saw the invasion of Iraq as not about weapons of mass destruction, but colonialism.\n\nBased on the current presidential race, I'd estimate that the U.S. political system will have the maturity and grace to hear this in maybe 300 years. And if the Pope brings any of this up at the Capitol, it's safe to say he's not going to be invited back.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

Matt Gaetz.\n\nWhile on a combat mission in Afghanistan's Laghman province on September 26, 2010, Miller shot 27-year-old Atta Mohammed in the head during an interrogation. Miller has maintained that he was acting in self-defense, alleging that Mohammed, who had walked through a defensive perimeter established by Miller's unit, could be a threat to his unit and that he had tried to grab Miller's weapon during the interrogation. But another National Guard member testified he heard Miller threaten to kill Mohammed if he did not tell the truth; and then sat on top of him - Mohammed was lying prone - before shooting him in the head, killing him. According to the prosecutor, Miller then said, \"I shot him. He was a liar.\"\n\nMohammed's body was left in a latrine , in violation of military standards.\n\nMiller covers armed forces and national security, international affairs, and veterans affairs for Gaetz, according to the Congress-tracking website LegiStorm. Gaetz serves on the House Armed Services Committee.\n\n\"We proudly stand with our Military Legislative Assistant Derrick Miller,\" Joel Valdez, a spokesperson for Gaetz, told The Intercept. \"He was wrongfully convicted and served our country with honor.\"\n\nMiller did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"Over the course of nearly a decade, members of Congress, multiple advocacy groups, and over 16,000 individuals on a petition have all signaled their support for clearing his name and recognizing him as innocent of charges imposed by a weaponized military injustice system under President Obama,\" the spokesperson continued. \"Mr. Miller advises our office on many matters, including ways to make the military justice system consistent with our constitutional principles and values.\"\n\nOriginal reporting.

In 2017, Rep. Brian Babin, R-Texas, sent a letter to President Donald Trump asking him to review the case. \"As you know, our troops face extremely difficult decisions while serving in the heat of battle,\" the letter stated .\n\nRep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, also testified in his defense. By 2018, following a clemency hearing, the Army reduced Miller's sentence to 20 years, making him eligible for parole. He was released on May 20, 2019.\n\nMiller previously served as a military adviser for Gohmert from July 2019 to September of last year. During the same time period, Miller was executive director of the Congressional Justice for Warriors Caucus, which describes itself as \"dedicated to educating members of Congress about combat-related incidents where U.S. service members who are fighting for our freedoms have been unjustly incarcerated under the [Uniform Code of Military Justice].\" CJWC's membership includes five Republicans: Reps. Matt Gaetz, Paul Gosar, Ralph Norman, Greg Murphy, and Brian Babin.\n\nGaetz has intervened on behalf of another servicemember accused of war crimes. In 2019, Gaetz reportedly wrote a letter to Trump on behalf of Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher , then charged with war crimes in relation to the killing of an Iraqi prisoner of war in Mosul in 2017. Gallagher was charged with stabbing a 17-year-old ISIS prisoner to death, posing with his corpse, and sending the photo to friends. He was convicted of posing for the photograph but acquitted of the other charges. United American Patriots, an organization that provides legal defense for U.S. servicemembers it believes were wrongly convicted of war crimes, also advocated for Miller and Gallagher.\n\n\"We completely comprehend and appreciate the necessity for good order and discipline within our Armed Forces,\" the letter from Gaetz stated. \"However, our experience has witnessed a verifiable bias against the warfighter that is completely political in nature by the United States Navy's Justice system.\"\n\nCorrection: March 29, 2023, 4:43 p.m. This piece previously characterized Eddie Gallagher as a \"soldier\"; this has been corrected, as Gallagher was in the Navy, not the Army.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "How Democrats Paved the Way for Kevin McCarthy's Attack on Ilhan Omar\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nFor years, Republicans made spurious allegations of antisemitism against Rep. Ilhan Omar for her criticisms of Israel - and Democrats joined in.\n\nCongressional Democrats showed an unusually unified front in support of Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., as she faced attacks from House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. As leader of the Republican-controlled House, McCarthy succeeded Thursday in his attempts to strip Omar from her seat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, where she has been a vocal critic of the war-industrial complex and human rights abuses in which the U.S. has been either a primary actor or a sponsor.\n\nOn Thursday, the House voted on party lines to remove Omar from the committee by a vote of 218 to 211. Despite congressional Democrats' unity, members of the party bear part of the blame for validating McCarthy's broadsides against Omar in the first place.\n\nMcCarthy and his colleagues' attacks on Omar go back to 2019, in her first month in Congress, when he called on Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., then the House speaker, to remove Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee. McCarthy cited the Minnesota representative's criticisms of Israel's human rights abuses and her support for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, a Palestinian civil society movement working to build international opposition to Israel's occupation of Palestine.\n\nAt the time, Rep. Lee Zeldin, who was most recently New York's Republican gubernatorial candidate, tweeted that he was disappointed that Omar had also been appointed to a Foreign Affairs subcommittee on oversight and accused her of harboring \"anti-Semitic & anti-Israel hate.\"\n\nShortly afterward, Democrats began to affirm the message from Republicans in their public remarks and congressional letters, laying the groundwork that would set the stage for their most recent salvo: McCarthy's bid to remove Omar from her committee assignments.\n\nSome Democrats, even voting against McCarthy's motion, reportedly continued to justify his actions and rehash old allegations against Omar. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said the vote was about political revenge but that Omar had \"clearly made mistakes\" and used \"anti-Semitic tropes.\"\n\n\"When Democrats were in control of the House, they were often attacking her for the same exact thing and throwing her under the bus when Republicans started criticizing her,\" said Beth Miller, political director of Jewish Voice for Peace Action. \"They have created an environment that shows that they are willing to attack and throw under the bus any member of their own party who calls for Palestinian human rights.\"\n\nMiller, who said she is relieved that Democrats are now supporting Omar, noted that this fight isn't happening in a vacuum. The progressive Jewish American group put out a statement Wednesday connecting the attacks on Omar to attacks on progressives everywhere.\n\nThe GOP, Miller said, is using its power to attack progressives: \"And specifically progressive women of color, because they are effective progressives who are speaking out for Palestinian rights.\"\n\nThe effort to remove Omar based on her criticisms of Israel also comes at a time when Israeli politics are making an unprecedented lurch to the far right and the Jewish state is ramping up its attacks on Palestinians; more than 30 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli security forces so far this year.\n\n\"This circus is happening while the Israeli government is escalating an entirely new phase of state violence against Palestinians,\" Miller said. \"If you actually look at what the Israeli government is doing right now, the mask is off completely.\"\n\n. @SpeakerMcCarthy 's efforts to remove Rep. @Ilhan from the Foreign Affairs Committee is part of the perverse backroom deals he made with the Freedom Caucus to secure his gavel.\n\nWe won't stand for white supremacist efforts to use Islamophobia & racism to silence her.\n\n- Congresswoman Cori Bush (@RepCori) February 1, 2023\n\nThe Democratic pile-on against Omar came just four years ago.\n\nJust over a month after Omar took office as one of the first Muslim women ever elected to Congress, in February 2019, House Democrats swiftly condemned her for a tweet criticizing the relationship between members of Congress and the pro-Israel lobby flagship, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.\n\n\"It's all about the Benjamins, baby,\" Omar wrote. She clarified that she was referring to AIPAC specifically and later apologized for the tweet.\n\nThe next day, conservative New Jersey Democrat Rep. Josh Gottheimer and then-Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Va., wrote a searing letter to House Democratic leadership that did not mention Omar by name but noted their concern about antisemitic rhetoric in \"reckless statements like those yesterday.\" They called on the caucus to not \"remain silent in the face of hateful speech or actions\" and to \"take swift action\" to address the issue \"by reiterating our rejection of anti-Semitism and our continued support for the State of Israel.\"\n\nIn a statement the same day, House Democratic leaders including Pelosi; Majority Leader Steny Hoyer; D-Md.; Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C.; Assistant Speaker Ben Ray Luján, D-N.M.; Caucus Chair Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.; and Caucus Vice Chair Katherine Clark, D-Mass., said, \"Omar's use of anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israel's supporters is deeply offensive.\"\n\nThe House voted on a resolution two days later to condemn antisemitism - a rebuke of Omar - after tacking the measure onto an unrelated resolution on the Saudi war in Yemen.\n\nThe next month, after Omar again raised criticism of the pro-Israel lobby in remarks at a coffee shop in Washington, the House took yet another vote to condemn antisemitism along with Islamophobia and racism in general.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nWhile McCarthy, building off Democrats' attacks, is going after Omar for purported biases, the GOP has long been home to several members who have espoused or defended explicit antisemitism and white nationalism, including Reps. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., and Marjorie Taylor Greene , R-Ga., and former Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa. McCarthy's focus instead has been on Omar.\n\nWhile McCarthy's campaign against Omar revolves around antisemitism allegations, Washington insiders said the long-running flap was really about her criticisms of Israel and the power of the pro-Israel lobby on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"As I think most people know and just don't care to say publicly, both parties have an Israel lobby problem,\" said one senior congressional Democratic aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of professional reprisal. \"They can't figure out where they actually stand on this issue.\" The aide added, \"They don't know how to talk about it.\"\n\nUpon her arrival, Omar bucked the consensus in Congress and became one of a few members who was willing to issue strong criticisms of human rights abuses in Israel and Palestine - as well as the pro-Israel lobby . \"It's almost like that person who comes into your classroom and tells you everything you're learning is wrong,\" the congressional aide said. \"I think that's how a lot of Democratic members felt when they had to engage with her. They did not know how to deal with a person saying, 'You know what, the United States is not meeting the moment.'\"\n\nIn the meantime, Washington was spending its time battling over whether to kick Omar off of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, when Omar herself has directly experienced the impacts of war and U.S. foreign policy, said Miller, of Jewish Voice for Peace Action. That conundrum, she said, is \"the perfect example of everything that is broken with the way that Washington, D.C., approaches how we look at foreign policy.\"\n\n\"We will see in generations what she's actually done for this place as we find new leaders,\" the senior Democratic aide said. \"It is without question an old, old problem that Democrats in Congress are late to the party on Israel.\"\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

Twitter, meanwhile, has temporarily locked his account; it's a boon, no doubt, to the right-wing media ecosystem that fueled today's insanity.\n\nThe Capitol, as we record this, has been cleared, and Matt tells me he has returned to the press gallery, where he's watching what should have been a perfunctory Electoral College ceremony stumble toward its conclusion, over the continued objection of Republican after Republican, after Republican.\n\n- Ryan Grim\n\nTranscript begins here\n\n[Cheers of \"Stop the Steal\"]\n\nJoe Biden: I call on President Trump to go on national television now and demand an end to this siege.\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump: All of us here today do not want to see our election victory stolen by emboldened radical left Democrats, which is what they're doing.\n\nJB : To storm the Capitol, threatening the safety of duly elected officials. It's not protest: it's insurrection.\n\nDJT: We will never give up. We will never concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's theft involved. [Screams and cheers.]\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nRyan Grim: At 2:18 Wednesday afternoon, Capitol Police sent out an ominous warning to congressional staffers and members of Congress. It read: \"Internal security threat: move inside office/lock doors, seek cover, and remain silent.\"\n\nNewscaster: Up on the steps of the backside of the Capitol, we're seeing protesters overcome the police. The police are now running back into the Capitol building. We have cheers from the protesters that are watching behind the scenes. This is incredible.\n\nRG: The warning was a bit late. Protesters were already at the door of the congressional staffer who sent me an image of the text alert.\n\nProtestor: You guys did this to us. We want our country back. We are protesting for our freedom right now.\n\nProtestor: They work for us. They don't get to steal it from us.\n\nRG: About an hour earlier, Trump supporters intent on stopping Joe Biden from being president had smashed into the United States Capitol and the surrounding offices, unleashing violence across the complex. One woman was shot and killed by Capitol Police.\n\nNewscaster: Inside the chamber itself it was chaos: agents hastily blocking the doors with furniture to keep the protesters out, officers ready to open fire as a last resort.\n\nRG: The fallout from this assault, which is ongoing as we record this, will be unfolding for a very long time. There will be plenty of time in the days, weeks, and months ahead to talk about what this all means, but for today, we want to talk about what happened.\n\nNewscaster: We were just told that there has been teargas in the rotunda, and we're being instructed to, each of us, get gas masks that are under our seats.\n\nRG: On Wednesday afternoon, a handful of Capitol Hill reporters caught in the melee were shepherded to a secure location along with about 200 members of Congress as the insurrectionists breached the gates.\n\nOne of them was Matt Fuller, a friend and a former longtime colleague of mine back when I was at The Huffington Post.

His beat the last decade has been the far-right wing of the House Republican conference, known as the Freedom Caucus, which is inextricably linked with this violence, and was also, it turns out, sheltered-in-place with Matt.\n\nBut first, we talk with Jon Farina, who was shooting camera footage of a rally earlier in the day, as well as the assault on the Capitol, for the independent media organization Status Coup.\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nRG: Jon, so how did this start this morning?\n\nJon Farina: Well, they were having a I believe it was called \"Save America Rally\" inside the Ellipse, which is between the Washington Monument and the White House. Now, in the Ellipse, they had a few speakers: Eric Trump, and then Donald Trump went up, and I'm not sure who else spoke.\n\nBut I had left a few minutes early to walk down to the Capitol because that's where they were gonna all march to after Trump had finished his speech. But there were people there already, so I made my way over there. And I started doing a couple of interviews and then all of a sudden I heard \"Yes! They're in!\" Like, I started hearing cheering. And I looked behind me and they started walking. They had breached the fence to the grounds of the Capitol. So then everybody just started like, flowing into the grass and and walking up to the steps. Police were you know, at that point, they were very calm, they were like, \"Hey, no, no, you can't do this, back up.\" And then they just couldn't, they couldn't control the crowd; it was just way too many people.\n\nRG: I saw some of your footage, and it looked like for a while the police were managing to hold them off using those kind of short metal fences and kind of bracing them and pushing them back. What allowed the insurrectionists to finally get through?\n\nJF: Well, once they were on the Capitol grounds, the police had the barricades set up but, you know, the protesters just kept grabbing the barriers and pulling it towards them. So they had kind of had like a tug-of-war match and, at that point, they just could not control the crowd. Tear gas, pep bullets were shot at, pepper spray - both sides were macing each other. So the protestors were macing the cops; cops are macing them. And it was just back and forth clashes.\n\nRG: What were the protesters saying to the cops?\n\nJF: You know, they were just saying, \"We're here for you,\" you know, \"Come join us,\" \"We're on your side.\" You know, \"How could you do this to us?\" They were saying, \"Oh, the criminals are inside the building. We're not the criminals.\" You know, basically, I don't know, can I curse or -?\n\nRF: Go for it.\n\nJF: Yeah, so they were screaming: \"Fuck you. Fuck the police.\" That kind of stuff. Stuff that, you know, normally, they would be the back-the-blue crowd, but they were just like - they didn't care at that point. They saw them as - they were their enemy.\n\nRG: Mhmm.\n\nJF: Yeah, I mean they said a few other things. There were so many things. I just have to go back to the footage,\n\nRG: Right. Did the police try to engage or de-escalate or were they just kind of stoically kind of holding the railing?\n\nJF: Yeah, no, I mean, the police tried to de-escalate it, but the crowd just kept pushing up against them. And, you know, as much as they were shooting them with the, like I said, the pepper balls and the tear gas and the flesh grenades, the flashbangs that were going off, the crowd weren't fazed by it. They were actually enjoying it, for the most part.\n\nRG: Did you follow them into the Capitol or up the steps?\n\nJF: Yeah. I did, actually. I followed them all the way up to the steps, inside a little corridor where it was completely hectic. You know, the protesters, they actually got the police shields and they were using the shields against them. They were taking, you know, taking whatever they could from the cops, the mace, they had their batons, they had their shields, and they were using their stuff against them to try and push further into the Capitol.\n\nRG: What were the police doing at that point, when they were stealing their mace, and their clubs, and their shields?\n\nJF: They were calling in reinforcements and just kept battling out with them. And there were moments where they would stop, and it would be calm, and they will look at each other like - the police wouldn't arrest them, they would just look at them and be like, \"Hey, let's, you know, chill out.\" And they would try and talk it out. But then there would come another wave and then would try and push their way in.\n\nI saw a few arrests, but not as many as I thought that there would be.\n\nRG: Oh, so they did arrest a couple of people?\n\nJF: Yeah, yeah, there were a few arrests.\n\nRG: What would get somebody arrested? Like trying to punch a cop or?\n\nJF: Yeah. I mean, people were attacking the cops like hitting them with whatever weapons they had. So any chance that the police had an opportunity to just grab somebody and pull them in, that's what they did. But yeah, I mean -\n\nRG: Gotcha.\n\nJF: Yeah, it was - it was wild.\n\nRG: How'd you finally get out of there? Was it hard to get out of there? Or did you have to go through a crowd?\n\nJF: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I had to push through a crowd and work my way out. But at that point, I mean, I couldn't see anything. My face is still burning up - my eyes. So I had to just kind of feel my way out. And then people outside the building kind of helped me out; they gave me water and stuff like that.\n\nRG: You've covered a lot of right-wing violence, right-wing demonstrations. Was there something significantly different about this one? Or was it just the same but in degree, it was more violent, and more aggressive, and bigger?\n\nJF: Well, they're very emotional about this. And I think the emotions took over. But this has been building up, because they see this as their stand. Like, this was it. Yeah, I think just because that this is like the final countdown until they lose their guy. And they wanted to make a statement.\n\nRG : Did anyone have an end game? Like, did you ask them what the ultimate goal was? You stormed the Capitol? OK. And then what?\n\nJF: I did not get to ask anybody that. I wish I did.\n\nI mean, I did ask few people before that whole thing, you know, when I was interviewing people at the Washington Monument, I was kind of asking them: \"So if Biden wins and Trump's out, you know what happens from here?\" And some of them said \"civil war,\" but others said, \"You know what, I can't tell ya. I have no idea.\" They were just like, \"I think it's going to be bad.\"\n\nRG: Well, they're not wrong.\n\nJF: Yeah. Yep. Not at all.\n\nRG: Well, Jon, thanks so much for sharing that with us.\n\nRG: Absolutely. Thank you for having me.\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nRG: That was Jon Farina of Status Coup. Matt Fuller from HuffPost spoke to me Wednesday afternoon while still locked down with members of Congress, and walked me through the moment when he first got word that the building had been breached.\n\nMatt Fuller: Well, we probably got an early indication that they might be locking down the chamber, that there was a sort of a breach or something like that. And luckily, I had a gallery member say, \"Hey, you might want to go to the bathroom, because they're gonna be locking this down pretty shortly.\"\n\nSo I went to the bathroom, came back, and about a minute later, you saw cops running to each door and locking the doors really quickly. So they were clearly locking us in the chamber. We were in the chamber for a while. And everyone was just sort of tense, not sure what was going on. But we obviously assumed that some protesters have gotten through.\n\nYou know, at some point, they started banging on the doors, and it was clear that they were right outside of the chamber. So they started barricading things. We don't know, at this point, if it was gunshots. Everyone thought it was gunshots, and we heard an officer say \"gun,\" but some of the glass popped out - seemingly like a gun, it sounded like a gun at least - of the door, right to the chamber. And then officers had their guns drawn, it was a pretty tense situation.\n\nOne member tried to talk to the protesters. And it seemed to be going OK. But then they sort of made a decision to move everyone who is remaining in the chamber. And at that point, it was pretty limited. They already evacuated most people on the floor and most people in the galleries. And it just so happened I was in sort of a far corner, where I was one of the last people evacuated just because of the distance. And when they started popping out the glass, you know, there were like three or four of us who were kind of coming, and we just kind of hit the ground and watched the whole scene unfold.\n\nRG: And so don't tell me where they took you, because I understand it's an undisclosed location. This situation is not resolved yet. But they moved you with a bunch of members of Congress and staff all together? How did that happen?\n\nMF: That's right, we were with about the final group of members who were moving, and I'd say there were about 10 or 20 of us, and they moved us through the Capitol. I'm not gonna say where, but we moved quite a distance. And then we're in a room now, a larger room, with I'd between 100-200 members - or, not just members. I mean, it's a mix of floor staff, and there's a few press here, some staff, but it's predominantly members. And there's, you know, a decent police presence here. But I don't know how long we've been in this room now. Probably a couple hours now. We keep on getting updates that they're gonna let us know, any minute - 30 minutes, an hour. And they keep on saying, \"Well, we still haven't cleared the Capitol yet. There's still protesters there.\"\n\nRG: What's the conversation been like among the members in the room?\n\nMF: You know, I think this is a kind of an interesting moment. I've had actually a couple of conversations with some members, too - some members who have been sort of involved in this - and I think it is for some people, a little bit of a kind of come-to-Jesus moment. You know, not to reveal too much, but I did see one member who was involved in this texting to one of the staff members, \"I'm sickened by this.\"\n\nAnd, you know, I think that there's been a lot of Republicans who have been complicit for political reasons, and they just sort of made peace with this is something we have to do. And, you know, obviously, that's not the truth, but it's sort of the truth that they're living by. And then you see this and they think, you know, \"What have we done? How did we get to this moment where people are, it's basically an insurrection?\" I mean, people are storming down the Capitol, you know, banging through the doors. And it's a violent insurrection. That's the best way I can put it.\n\nRG: And for people who don't know, Matt Fuller is kind of the leading reporter of the far-right wing of the house House Republicans over the years. You've been watching the Freedom Caucus develop over the years. You know lot of those members. Did you ever see this coming, or do you think they saw this coming?\n\nMF: Well, for one, an interesting development here is a lot of those members, the, you know, the leaders of this movement are here in this room right now. And it's a split between Democrats and Republicans. They've been talking - I can see them talking right now, actually.\n\nBut yeah, I think that they knew this was always a possibility. This is where the rhetoric was leading them. You know, let's face it. Yes, you're telling your voters that this election was stolen, that Democrats are breaking the law, and they're installing a president illegally. I mean, this is sort of a natural conclusion, right? I think that people are genuinely mad. And so many people have been lied to for so long they're operating by just a totally alternate reality.\n\nThe truth is a lot of those members, you know, as far-right leaders, they believe it themselves. They're right in that same boat at this point. You know, there's a lot of other ones who are sort of on the fringe who don't quite believe it, but, you know, see the utility of continuing to do this. So it's definitely a weird moment here for them. And I think it's the reaping and sowing meme, it's like \"Oh, no, what happened? I'm sowing all the stuff I've been reaping!\"\n\nRG: Right. Did you talk to any of the protesters?\n\nMF: [Laughs.] I did on my way in. I mean, I live very close to the Capitol. And, you know, I had some people asking me, you know, \"Can I park here?\" And this or that.\n\nRG: Can I park here for my insurrection?\n\nMF: [Laughs.] Yeah, and it was almost always like, \"You're gonna get a ticket, but you might not get towed, I'm not sure.\"\n\nRG: Well, I remember hearing that Pinochet, on his way to the palace, when he performed his coup, those tanks stopped at red lights, which was a very Chilean thing. And it's kind of a very American thing that they're worried about parking tickets. And I also saw that a lot of them were staying within the red velvet ropes when they're walking through Statuary Hall.\n\nMF: Exactly, exactly right. I had that exact feeling. I mean, it's like, they still want to operate within society. You know, I saw some people wearing masks. It's just sort of an incredible moment. And then to, you know, watch the same people storm the Capitol.\n\nAt some point, they made the decision that the House floor was going to get breached or wasn't safe anymore, which - I've always sort of lived under the assumption that the House floor is the safest place you can be. It's like hermetically sealed, it has its own oxygen supply. But, you know, at some point, they were telling us, \"Get the gas masks from under your chair.\" They gave us, in the gallery, gas masks with the escape hoods. And it was sort of like you might be wading through tear gas in a moment or so.\n\nYou know, we're stuck in this room. And we don't really know what's going on. We see reports on Twitter, of the FBI SWAT team. We've heard that the National Guard is coming, the Virginia National Guard's coming. You know. We don't know.\n\nLawmaker: Bathroom back here?\n\nMF: A member passed by and asked where the bathroom is.\n\nRG: [Laughs.] You gotta pee in the corner.\n\nMF: It's a crazy moment.\n\nRG: You know, like you said, this is the logical endpoint of all of this. But at the same time, it's so hard to have imagined it coming to this.\n\nMF: Yeah. I mean, I never thought I'd see the day where people break through the Capitol, and like, you know, true sort of pandemonium on the House floor. And it happened so quickly. I mean, it was clear that the police weren't ready for this. And they certainly weren't, it was not like a shoot-to-kill situation. Which thankfully, I'm glad, I know that there have been some people injured and there apparently was a woman who was shot, but it certainly could have been a lot worse than this if the police just immediately reacted to more violence, that definitely would have been the situation.\n\nRG: Well, I hope they get you out of there pretty soon. Thanks for taking a moment. For people who don't know, Matt Fuller, a reporter at the Huffington Post. He had a good joke on Twitter. He said, \"Well, this wasn't in my pre-write.\"\n\nSo I hope that you're getting back to your copy because you've got a few paragraphs you're gonna have to add to it.\n\nMF: Yeah. Yeah. I think I have some time though.\n\nRG: Great. Well, Matt Fuller, thanks so much for taking some time out of your sheltering-in-place to join us on Deconstructed.\n\nMF: Of course. It's a pleasure talking to you always, Ryan.\n\nRG: An increasing number of Democrats are already calling for Trump's immediate impeachment and removal, a step that would prevent him from pardoning those who stormed the Capitol, prevent whatever else he might be planning, check out our last show on his designs on Iran for more on that and would make future presidents think twice before inciting insurrection after the loss of an election.\n\nTwitter, meanwhile, has temporarily locked his account - a boon, no doubt to the right-wing media ecosystem that fueled today's insanity. The Capitol, as we record this, has been cleared. And Matt tells me he has returned to the press gallery where he's watching what should have been a perfunctory Electoral College ceremony stumble toward its conclusion over the continued objection of Republican after Republican after Republican.\n\nRep. Paul Gosar: I rise both for myself and 60 of my colleagues to object to the counting of the electoral ballots from Arizona.\n\nRG: One Republican, however, often Trump's favorite in the Senate, did not object. And that was South Carolina's Lindsey Graham.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham: Trump and I, we've had a hell of a journey. I hate it to end this way. Oh my God, I hate it. From my point of view, he's been a consequential president.\n\nBut today, all I can say is: Count me out. Enough is enough. I've tried to be helpful. But when this Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled 4-3 that they didn't violate the Constitution of Wisconsin, I agree with the three but I accept the four. If Al Gore can accept 5-4 he's not president, I can accept Wisconsin 4-3.\n\nThey say there's 66,000 people in Georgia under 18 voted. How many people believe that? I asked give me 10. Hadn't had one. They said 8,000 felons in prison in Arizona voted. Give me 10. Hadn't gotten one. I don't buy this. Enough's enough. We got to end it.\n\nTo the conservatives who believe in the Constitution, now's your chance to stand up and be counted. I cannot convince people - certain groups - by my words, but I will tell you by my actions that maybe I among any - above all others in this body - need to say this: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are lawfully elected and will become the president and the vice president the united states on January the 20th.

That's why her recent stances on Turkey, the Kurds, and the Armenian genocide are so disappointing.\n\nUS Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) arrives to a closed session before the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight committees October 22, 2019 in Washington, DC.\nAlex Wroblewski / Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nSince her election to Congress in 2018, Minnesota representative Ilhan Omar has emerged as one of the most important progressive leaders in contemporary US politics. She has used her considerable rhetorical skills to push for Medicare for All and a Green New Deal. She has championed legislation to cancel student loan debt and provide all school children with three meals a day . Last month, she endorsed Bernie Sanders for president.\n\nBut it is as a critic of US foreign policy that Omar has really stood out . She opposed the Trump administration's attempts to foment a coup in Venezuela; skewered resurrected Reagan-era ghoul Elliott Abrams for his role in US-backed atrocities in Central America; harshly criticized Saudi autocracy, even calling for a boycott of the Hajj; stood on the side of Kashmiris under siege by the Indian government; signed congressional letters drawing attention to the human rights crisis in Brazil ; and spoken up for the rights and basic humanity of Palestinians (still a controversial point in much of Washington).\n\nFor all of this, Omar has been hit with endless hatred and vitriol. President Trump has singled her out on social media and at rallies . House Democrats moved to censure her as an antisemite. Yet she has handled the death threats and bile with uncommon courage, righteous anger, and good humor. Instead of flinching from foreign policy minefields, Omar has taken bold stance after bold stance. Global affairs and the creation of a just international system are clearly near and dear to Omar's heart.\n\nThat's why her position on issues related to Turkey and the Kurds has been so disappointing. While Omar has made important statements on the invasion of Syria - which has quickly emerged as one of the defining foreign policy issues of the Trump era - she didn't vote on a resolution last month condemning Trump's purported withdrawal and subsequently voted against a set of targeted sanctions on Turkey's defense industry.\n\nTo many on the Turkish and Kurdish left, Omar - for all her exemplary words and stances - is failing to stand up for the oppressed in her usual unequivocal terms.\n\nCriticism of Omar's relationship with Turkey is not new. In 2017, Omar (then a Minnesota state representative) met with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan - the same Recep Tayyip Erdoğan who had suppressed the 2013 Gezi protests , ramped up the war against the Kurds , allowed jihadis to flow into Syria, and jailed academics and journalists. Left critics wondered how Omar could advocate for Palestinian rights while remaining silent on the oppression of the Kurdish people or, more generally, the autocratic élan of Erdogan.\n\nSince Omar's ascension to Congress, Erdoğan's authoritarianism has only deepened. Repression has been ratcheted up against elected Kurdish political leaders, who are imprisoned on the flimsiest of grounds. Last year, Turkey invaded the Kurdish-held Syrian province of Afrin, displacing thousands. And then of course most recently, Turkey launched an incursion into northern Syria to wipe out the Kurdish-led autonomous region of Rojava .\n\nYet Omar didn't vote on a resolution last month condemning Trump's ostensible withdrawal. Omar has also been critical of placing sanctions on Turkey. In an October 23 op-ed published in the Washington Post , she linked calls for sanctions against Turkey to the US's indiscriminate and wide-ranging measures against countries such as Venezuela and Iran, noting:\n\nResearch has shown that sanctions rarely achieve their desired goals. In the worst-case scenario, they hurt the people of a country - generally the very people we're purporting to help - without making a dent in the country's behavior. And in the case of human rights abusers, research suggests that more abuses typically occur with economic sanctions in place than without them.\n\nThis is undoubtedly a legitimate criticism of most US sanctions. Yet the PACT sanctions offered up by Congress, and which Omar voted against earlier this week , were not the kind of blanket punishment that have caused so much suffering in Iran or Venezuela. They targeted Turkey's defense industry and political leaders - a move that would undermine Erdogan's ability to wage war and a type of sanction that Omar, in her op-ed, claims to support. In voting against PACT, she showed solidarity not with those being murdered by Turkish forces in northern Syria but with Erdoğan and the fifteen Republicans who voted against the resolution.\n\nIf Omar has been disappointing on sanctions, perhaps the biggest self-inflected blow has been on a symbolic issue: the recognition of the Armenian genocide. While Omar did not vote against the measure this week (registering as \"present,\" along with Texas Democrat Eddie Bernice Johnson and Republican Paul Gosar), her response to criticism has been frustrating for many of her supporters and defenders.\n\nI believe accountability for human rights violations - especially ethnic cleansing and genocide - is paramount. But accountability and recognition of genocide should not be used as a cudgel in a political fight. It should be done based on academic consensus outside the push and pull of geopolitics. A true acknowledgement of historical crimes against humanity must include both the heinous genocides of the 20th century, along with earlier mass slaughters like the transatlantic slave trade and Native American genocide, which took the lives of hundreds of millions of indigenous people in this county. For this reason, I voted \"present\" on the final passage of H.Res 296, the resolution Affirming the United States record on the Armenian Genocide.\n\nThis statement is troubling on numerous levels. First, Omar might balk at the use of genocide recognition as a \"cudgel.\" However, given Turkey's ongoing campaign of ethnic cleansing and brutalization of the Kurds it is precisely the moment for such recognition. Indeed, Eroğan's plan to \"cleanse\" Turkey of three to four million Syrian refugees by deporting them to a small strip of desert - a plan announced to the whole world at the United Nations in late September - also has ominous echoes of what the Ottomans did to the Armenians in 1915.\n\nSecond, it seems naive at best to believe that the debate on the Armenian genocide can be decoupled from politics, especially given the social and political taboo in Turkey against discussing the massacre. Worse still, the \"leave it to the academic consensus\" echoes Turkish talking points. There is no serious debate about whether the Armenian genocide was a genocide. Decades of scholarship have shown that the Committee of Union and Progress that governed the Ottoman Empire during the First World War sought to destroy its Armenian population. Most recently, Turkish scholar and dissident Taner Akçam has provided extensive documentation of the systematic nature of the assault visited upon the Anatolian Armenians. To draw an analogy, the debate about Armenian genocide is akin to the debate about whether Hitler sought to annihilate the Jewish people.\n\nFinally, Omar's demand that no recognition of the Armenian genocide take place until other historical crimes are acknowledged is a case of what-aboutism - one that is especially jarring because it comes from the mouth of such a committed advocate of solidarity and human rights. It's precisely because of Omar's exceptional record that we should demand more of her as a progressive, anti-imperialist tribune.\n\nWhat accounts for Omar's lackluster stance on Turkey, Kurdish issues, and the Armenian genocide?\n\nOne potential explanation stems from Turkey's role in Somalia. In recent years, Turkey has shrewdly deployed its soft power across Africa, including by providing extensive humanitarian assistance to Somalia . Erdogan himself visited the country in the summer of 2011 , at the height of a devastating famine. Omar, whose family is from Somalia, represents a district with a strong Somali community. Perhaps her willingness to overlook Turkey's unsavory actions reflects the reality that all politics is local.\n\nWhatever the reason, Omar's shortcomings in this area are extremely disappointing. They are all the more disappointing when compared to her bold stances on issues ranging from Palestine and Saudi Arabia to Venezuela and El Salvador.\n\nOmar has positioned herself as a critic of imperialism, an opponent of tyranny, and a defender of the oppressed. But just as a leftism that ignores the plight of Palestinians is hollow, so too is one that fails to recognize the horrors inflicted upon the Armenians in 1915, the brutalities of the Republic of Turkey, and the systematic oppression facing most of the Middle East's Kurdish population.\n\nNote: This piece has been updated to reflect the statements that Representative Omar has recently delivered on the Turkish invasion and Kurdish rights, including here and here .\n\nDjene Bajalan is an assistant professor in the Department of History at Missouri State University.

(Samuel Corum / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nTrump's troops, summoned by the Líder Máximo, assembled in Washington, DC, their minds mangled by an ideological fusillade of conspiratorial tripe about frauds, stolen elections, and political betrayal. The Commander-in-Chief appeared with others at the Washington rally. He and his entourage did not disappoint the crowd, pillorying the \"radical socialist\" Democrats and Republican renegades, excoriating those who would grant Joe Biden the presidency on the basis of an electoral travesty.\n\nThere was talk of \"patriots kicking ass,\" and exhortations to \"Fight, fight, fight!\" Trump wept tears of rage, tears of grief, reminiscent of Bob Dylan and The Band's lyrics from Music from Big Pink (1967-68): \"We carried you in our arms on Independence Day / And now you'd throw us all aside and put us all away / Oh, what dear daughter 'neath the sun could treat a father so? / To wait upon him hand and foot and always tell him, 'No.'\"\n\nThe election, Trump claimed, was stolen from him and, by extension, from them, his loyal subjects. They were a motley crew: overwhelmingly white, the old and not-quite-so-old, if not too many who were young. Donning the colors of the Proud Boys, biker gangs, and white supremacists, many were the kinds of human material it is easy to loathe, including neofascistic combatants trained in the paramilitary wing of the far right.\n\nBut there were undoubtedly marginalized and poor people among the Trumpers as well. Unemployed or reduced to the most precarious of livelihoods, these men and women are guilty of much, including stupidity, but given their lack of political representation, and the absence of a genuine voice addressing their needs, the illusions Trump promotes nurture a false consciousness that is truly tragic.\n\nOthers among the \"Fight for Trump\" crowd, buying into the \"Wild Time\" promised by the presidential twitter feed, were independent contractors, self-employed professionals, the pettiest of the petty bourgeoisie. And there were fundamentalist Christians rubbing shoulders with nihilistic grifters. These were the shock troops, ready to rock.\n\nSome notables, like Rudy Giuliani, shared the outdoor stage with Trump, speaking from behind the plexiglass-protected dais, calling for \"Trial by Combat.\" Brave talk that would not, of course, be followed by the walk. Like Giuliani, the speculative and parasitic elements of capital that sustain Trumpism materially were not likely to take their politics to the streets; they watched the proceedings from afar.  Nonetheless, such billionaires are decisive in sustaining the Trump coalition, as the likes of Ted Cruz and his co-objectors appreciate so well.\n\nCalling on his followers to be strong, to never concede defeat, and to march on the Biden confirmation proceedings, Trump said he would join the procession down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol, only to disappear into the White House, partake of a nice lunch, and watch the televised spectacle unfold. As Marx wrote in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte : \"When you play the fiddle at the top of the state, what else is to be expected but that those down below dance.\"\n\nForty thousand in number, the Trump throng assembled under the flags of the United States, the Klan's conception of the Confederacy, and the Tea Party's favored Colonel Christopher Gadsden standard (designed during the American Revolution, a coiled rattlesnake poised on a yellow background over the words \"Don't Tread on Me\"). But the day's banner of choice was simply emblazoned \"TRUMP.\"\n\nThe angry crowd soon surrounded and then overwhelmed the Capitol, seat of the deliberative branch of the US government. Members of the Senate and their counterparts in the House of Representatives, going through the ritual of formally constituting the composition of the Electoral College that would establish Biden as the president-elect, were blithely unaware of what was happening outside of their sanctuary.\n\nThe most bellicose of Trump's ragtag brigade no doubt wanted to confront Mike Pence, their contempt for what they regarded as his Judas-like act of betrayal in overseeing Biden's coronation ramped up by Trump's escalating petulance. Some among them constructed a mock gallows, from which was suspended a menacing noose. Among this contingent of the crowd the chant of choice was, \"Hang Mike Pence!\"\n\nSkirmishes ensued and soon a significant number of the Never Bideners entered the Capitol building, backing police into corridors, and taking over hallways, offices, and eventually forcing the presidential confirmation proceedings into retreat. The good men and women of the Congress took to the aisle floors, donning gas masks, or were evacuated to shelter and safety.\n\nAs the Trump supporters broke windows and battered doors, they gained entry to a number of chambers, including the Senate. One protester, sporting his COVID-19 mask and clowning around for the cameras, took Vice President Pence's usual seat, his fist raised in defiant salute.\n\nLaw enforcement personnel seemed not quite able to get themselves on the same page. At times battalions of police battled the determined demonstrators. Contingents of cops in full riot gear were crushed by the advancing wall of Trump's supporters, who were clearly in no mood to be stopped. There were, however, other scenes, less confrontational, more chummy. Some officers gave up the apparent ghost of guardianship rather quickly and easily, shunting metal fencing aside to let the crowd flow through or stepping away from a barricaded door and, essentially, abandoning their posts.\n\nA thirty-five-year old woman, Air Force veteran, QAnon ideologue, and financially-troubled small business owner, Ashli Babbitt, was shot and killed as she attempted to crash through a window leading to an area that the protesters had not breached. A fellow Wilder declared in shocked awe: \"They are supposed to shoot BLM [Black Lives Matter], but now they are shooting patriots.\"\n\nThree others died of \"medical emergencies\" such as heart attacks (memo to my fellow out-of-shape older, white men: don't put yourself in the position of being a battering ram for reaction) and dozens of police were hurt. One US Capitol officer, Brian Sicknick, succumbed to injuries apparently sustained when struck in the head with a fire extinguisher.\n\nAlabama GOP Congressman Mo Brooks, whose ultra-inflammatory speech to the Trump rally egged the crowd on to protest at the Capitol, now hails the fallen policeman as a hero, calling for death penalty retribution. As with everything Trumpite, hypocrisy overwhelms reason.\n\nEventually, after a few hours that saw the declaration of a 6 PM curfew and the arrival of massive police and National Guard reserves, the Capitol was cleared, the Electoral College hearings reconvened, and Biden confirmed.  Democracy prevailed; the insurrection was over.\n\nAll of this was broadcast in real time on all major television networks. Members of the House of Representatives and the Senate waxed eloquent about the cherished history of this citadel on a hill, this edifice that enshrines the dream that is American Democracy. A sacred place had been desecrated.\n\nIt had not faced such an invasion of the barbarians since the War of 1812. Thugs and rioters invaded the hallowed halls of the world's \"perfect union,\" where Congress conducts \"the People's Business.\" Media commentators vied with politicos in speeches of disbelief and indignant condemnation, a saccharine rhetoric of American self-satisfaction uniting liberals and conservatives alike.\n\nThe complacent assumption that the ideal of American democracy is not only real, but the beacon to which all progressive and advanced nations aspire, dripped from the mouths of those shocked and stunned by the threatening protest. That this \"anarchy,\" as it was called by television pundits of the Right and the liberal mainstream, was unleashed by the transparent barrage of disinformation emanating from the White House administration, rather than from the scapegoated, vilified forces of Antifa, only added to the incredulity.\n\nIt was not long before the more deranged voices of Trumpism, like Congressmen Brooks, Paul Gosar, and Matt Gaetz, intimated that left-wing, Black Bloc provocateurs were indeed involved in the violence, claims supported by no evidence whatsoever. Trump soon jumped on this bandwagon of balderdash.\n\nNo one dared speak truth to an apparently ideologically unassailable democracy, whose history is hardly one of unblemished good. Questioning the revered record of what has happened within the blessed walls of the Capitol was most decidedly not done in the face of the bad manners, audacious raucousness, intimidating violence, and brazen display of far-right ugliness evident among Trump's riotous advocates.\n\nClaims now abound that among some in the crowd the intent was to kidnap, put on trial, and physically harm office-holding traitors to Trump, like Pence, or hated Democrats, such as Nancy Pelosi. Whether such fears of what the rampaging elements of Trump's rally turned riotous intended to do would have been borne out had the crowd not been contained will never be known.\n\nWhat is certain is that the frightening situation on January 6 suffocated acknowledgement that the American state and its seemingly democratic institutions cry out to be interrogated and scrutinized critically. Whatever the circumstances, the job of the Left is never to whitewash the history of bourgeois democracy and the sins states commit in its name.\n\nThe Capitol Building is where the nation state has sanctified slavery and segregation. Within its walls the pockets of the rich have historically been lined with all kinds of \"honest graft,\" of which the modern tax cut is only the tip of an iceberg of largesse. Legislation drafted there has criminalized the poor and forced austerity measures down their constricted throats, established pernicious racist immigration exclusions, proclaimed and bankrolled wars, kept women in their subordinate domestic place, thwarted workers' struggles, and restricted the rights of the people to health and welfare. Democracy, American-style, has long backed dictators around the world and engineered coups in the name of \"regime change.\"\n\nReligion may well remain an opiate of the people. It certainly found a particular niche in the Trump crowd's politics of grievance. One prominent modern-day Know-Nothing placard proclaimed, \"Pelosi is the Devil,\" while a religious-like demonization of communism could be read on other signboards. Interspersed between \"Trump Is President\" banners were simple declarations that \"Jesus Saves.\" Exactly what was not clear.\n\nTrump? Truth? The electoral process? Or America's privileged place in the world economy? Not people dying by the hundreds of thousands of COVID-19. Not the homeless in New York, Calcutta, or Sao Paulo. Not refugees and jailed dissidents and those whose jobs and lives have been declared redundant in the proliferating crises that scar the landscape of modern capitalism.\n\nYet in the outpouring of resentment and shocked indignation at the temerity and travesty of trashing the Capitol, another opiate surfaced as the drug of choice in an obvious legitimation crisis. A religiously constructed veneration of the ceremonial trappings and ideological obfuscations of American democracy belied the critical truth that after two-and-a-half centuries United States experience still manages to confirm, on an almost daily basis, that some black lives do not matter, that the rich benefit from everything, including pandemic crisis, and the poor take it in the neck.\n\nSacrilege in the modern state is not so much a heretical pronouncement that God has fallen or is fallible. Rather, the mere suggestion that bourgeois democratic governance, and its material structures, are not to be worshipped adoringly - this is the blasphemy of America's national chauvinism.\n\nSedition! Insurrection! Domestic Terrorism! were the thus the words of the hour. January 6 was a day that would live in the history of the United States as one of infamy, likened in its ignominy and dishonor to Pearl Harbor. Hyperbole flowed as the trail of tears grew to a tidal wave.\n\nGeorge W. Bush and almost all other mainstream commentators likened the events of January 6 to \"banana republic\" coups. This gives banana republics and the politics of insurrection within them a bad name. No self-respecting attempted coup d'etat against a dictatorial regime in the developing world would have been willing to settle, as did the so-called insurgents of the Siege of the Capitol, 01/06/21, for a flurry of mayhem, a walk back to the hotel, and a comradely drink and sociable cigarette.\n\nYet Trump's patriot phalanx, some of whom urinated on the Capitol's floors and spread feces on is walls was satisfied with this as its particular day's work. The denouement of a few hours of domestic terror, seditious conspiracy, and violent insurrection was perhaps an indication less of what happened than of what did not.\n\nThe Capitol riot that has sparked such vehement condemnation among liberal commentators and sitting members of the United States Congress was certainly troubling, given the prominent place of white nationalist, fascistic elements within it. But it was no insurrection.\n\nMost of the crowd was not armed, there was no public display of long guns, and bear spray and flag poles were the weapons of choice in battles with the police, hardly the kind of firepower needed to bring the state down. No concerted effort had been made to coordinate a riotous demonstration against a symbol of state power, with actual insurrectionary intent among the military, sections of the media, or many other spheres where power is concentrated and perpetuated.\n\nWhat happened on January 6 was orchestrated chaos, to be sure. It was certainly characterized by violence and determination, as well as a bizarre theater of the absurd, most ostentatiously on display in the person of the horn-sporting, raccoon-skin draped, Jacob Chansley/Jake Ageli, his face painted in the red, white, and blue that matched his chants of \"USA! USA! USA!\" Dubbed the QAnon \"shaman,\" Chansley/Ageli suggests how lacking in anything approximating leadership or a coherent governing alternative the tumult of 01/06/21 was prerequisites of any insurrection worth the name. Like so many others who invaded the Capitol building, a flag-carrying Jake justified his presence in the protest by stating that he had been summoned to Washington by Donald Trump.\n\nAn insurrection with Trump at its head is surely destined to derail before a booked tee time or a sumptuous dinner. And it largely did. Trump, who at first reveled in the riot, pushed his sycophants in Congress to use the chaos to derail Biden's confirmation. He stalled when pressed to mobilize the National Guard to clear the Capitol of rioters, instead praising them as patriots whose deeds would not be forgotten, declaring his love for them. Ivanka Trump was, at first, of a like mind.\n\nA day later, Trump's tune changed. Allegations of treason and anguished announcements of former supporters that Trump had finally gone too far, prompted lawyers, aides, and advisors (and almost certainly the inner circle of nepotism so influential in the Oval Office) to insist that the president look after his own interests, protect himself from legal liability for the violence, and backtrack. Conceding an orderly transition to power, and throwing his supporters under the proverbial bus, a seemingly chastened Trump called for those guilty of violent acts to feel the full prosecutorial brunt of the law.\n\nRight-wing social media like Parler and 4chan blew up in contradictory messaging: While some railed against Trump's perfidy, anguishing that they had been sold out, others kept the faith. QAnon nodded knowingly that Trump would never desert the cause, and his public repudiation of the assault on the Capitol was another bit of deep state fakery, or perhaps a hacked hoax perpetrated by Chinese Communists.\n\nMany Trump supporters entwined in the loose knot of a socially constructed seditious conspiracy saw what a non-insurrection they had been whipped up to stage. They departed Washington, less with a bang, than with an audible whimper. Some of them, foolish enough to kindly provide the state with their videos of the events, are now being tracked down by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, US Marshals, and the Department of Justice.\n\nThey face a slew of charges: criminal trespass, assaulting police, disorderly conduct, theft of government property, illegal possession of a firearm, and many other transgressions, including possibly sedition, conspiracy, and murder. Those charged well deserve whatever fate awaits them at the hands of the criminal justice system, responsible as they are for their actions and the repugnant dog's breakfast of motivations that animated them.\n\nCertainly, there were some among the crowd's most prepared and well-trained combatants who are committed cadre of the extreme politics of reaction and willing participants in a raging war of hate and retribution. This dangerous militia-like presence in the Trump crowd no doubt provided a good part of its discipline and preparedness. Unlike their cell-phone touting ballast, these types might well avoid being collateral damage in Trump's insatiable appetite for adoration, refusing to be casualties in a sociopath's sense of entitlement. They will live to fight another day, a dangerous soldiery poisoned by the politics of toxic reaction.\n\nIf the riot at the Capitol buildings was sedition, it was truly a bizarre variant of this high crime against the state. No plan animated Trump's supporters other than to slap down, momentarily, his successor and nemesis. Sedition surely demands something more than a frenzied crowd and some capable militia-like figures willing to scale walls. To actually crown the actions of 01/06/21 a seditious insurrection is, of course, to structure them in ways that further deepens faith in the staying power of a socio-economic order fraying at its capitalist seams.\n\nThe defenders of this crisis-ridden system of exploitation and oppression, having seen an ostensible armed assault on its political caretakers handily put down, can proclaim themselves resilient and redoubtable, as did so many puffed up members of the House of Representatives and the Senate. They now have a platform from which to endlessly proclaim the Republic a bastion of righteousness encompassing liberty and espousing just values, able to vanquish an insurgent challenge with alacrity.\n\nA different assessment is possible. Indeed, the story of this insurrection that wasn't is how the vanguard of Trump's marauders were able to walk up steps of the Capitol Building largely unimpeded, ascend its walls with impunity, fly their flags from scaffolding, breach police barricades, and take over a seat of US government for a time, however brief.\n\nThe indignant invasion of the Capitol would never have gotten within a Molotov cocktail's throw of the building's stately stairways had it been a left-wing protest. Those of us who have seen a few marches on Washington, or Queen's Park or Parliament Hill in Canada, for that matter, know full well that the armed might of the state seldom goes to sleep the way it did on January 6.\n\nThis insurgency would have been stopped in its tracks before it ever got near the Biden confirmation hearings, if it was mobilized by those actually challenging power rather than hoping to sustain one particularly nefarious variant of it. That unique expression of politics - Trumpism - is an ideological edifice which sections of the \"law and order\" industry gravitate to instinctually.\n\nLeft-wing protest, if it threatens constituted authority in any way, has historically been met with unambiguous police force and often brutal repression. Generally, it is the cops that lose their cool in such situations, not the protesters.\n\nThis is what happened at the August 1968 anti-war demonstrations in Chicago during the Democratic Party's National Convention. The entire twelve-thousand-member Chicago police force was placed on rotating twelve-hour shifts; the US Army mobilized six thousand troops to \"protect\" the city, taking their place alongside six thousand National Guards (with an additional five thousand on standby alert), and two thousand Federal Bureau of Investigation and Secret Service agents.\n\nAs the respective forces of peaceniks and state troopers clashed, protesters were pushed through hotel plateglass windows by police, who beat the young demonstrators as they lay sprawled on broken glass. Six hundred arrests ensued; hundreds of injuries were sustained, not only by the dissidents but also by the gendarmes. In the end, the consensus of inquiries into what happened in this 1968 protest is that the police, not the demonstrators, rioted. But you could never say that the cops were not prepared, or that they assembled in insufficient numbers to protect property and the business of politics as usual.\n\n1968's repression was matched by a similar ruthless resolve in 1971. An attempt to shut down the District of Columbia on May Day, 1971, when tens of thousands of anti-war leftists massed at a number of sites to engage in civil disobedience aimed at calling attention to the imperialist carnage in Vietnam, was met with a decisive show of force.\n\nRichard M. Nixon's not-yet-disgraced attorney general, John Mitchell, unleashed thousands of Army troops, marines, and national guards to supplement the Capitol police, the Washington police, and reserves drawn from near and far. With Washington Post reporter Nicholas von Hoffman describing the nation's capital as a \"simulated Saigon,\" the city's traffic circles were designated battle zones, pitting combative protesters against the cops; teargas hung thickly in the air like a rainforest fog; and many a \"Mayday Tribe\" demonstrator had their shins and backs slapped with truncheons, and worse.\n\nRidden down by police horses, tossed into paddy wagons with abandon, twelve thousand were arrested, hauled off without due process, and incarcerated twenty to a two-person cell. Washington's jails soon overflowed, necessitating transporting those in police custody to makeshift detention camps.\n\nAt the \"Battle of the Bicentennial\" in Philadelphia in the summer of 1976, protesters gathered to declare an end to colonialism, and a \"Rich Off Our Backs - July 4th Coalition\" mobilized thousands to demand Puerto Rico's independence and defend the dispossessed of all colors from attack, marching through the streets of the City of Brotherly Love.\n\nWe did not get much love from Philly's police: I recall filing past a park and seeing hundreds of police lining a hilltop, batons menacingly thudding on their riot shields. One of these civic-minded officers turned his back on us, dropped his pants - all of them - and offered us a very unappealing full moon. I suppose this was a gesture preferable to a crack upside the head, but it did not express a lot of regard.\n\nMore recently many have witnessed rampaging police violence at anti-World Trade Organization Summit protests in Seattle, Vancouver, Toronto, and Quebec City, or Ontario Coalition of Poverty marches on provincial and federal legislatures in Toronto and Ottawa. The armed might of the state has not been shy in establishing fenced perimeters, pepper spraying demonstrators, kettling protesters, riding down marchers with horses, or corralling them with bicycles, and beating mercilessly on anyone who stepped out of what the police considered a proper line.\n\nPolice and \"intelligence agencies\" often infiltrate left-wing groups organizing protests, sometimes arresting \"ringleaders\" before the actual demonstrations occur. Those who ostensibly incite riot with their words are seldom given a pass, and many have been arrested and put through the wringer of costly and time-consuming trials.\n\nNone of this was evident on January 6. The Capitol Police treated the Trump rally as a legitimate expression of right-thinking dissent. Offers of police reinforcements apparently fell on deaf ears.  In spite of more than ample evidence that Trump's supporters were coming to Washington to raise wild hell and possibly worse, there were apparently no special provisions made, no attempt to put in place the kind of security personnel and protocols that are standard operating procedure in the playbook of state responses to left-wing protests.\n\nThat the American security state somehow missed the signs on extremist, right-wing social media sites of what was coming down on 01/06/21 is, simply, incomprehensible. Mother Jones has reported that in the month leading up to the Trump rally, the phrase, \"Storm the Capitol,\" was used 100,000 times on websites and platforms frequented by the far right.  Quite a few people in a lot of particular places inside the state apparatus and the agencies of policing let Trump's bidding be done by an archetypal \"Church and King\" mob.\n\nThe result was that when the Trump crowd proceeded to the Capitol, it had something of a cakewalk. A few metal barricades were in place, and a modest contingent of police \"guarded\" the Capitol building's entrances.  When the crowd proved unruly and determined to break its way into the legislative chambers, there was simply no stopping it. Indeed, cops moved fencing aside so protesters could enter the Capitol. Even after Ms. Babbitt was shot (one cop or secret security agent obviously did not get the message to handle Trump's troops with kid gloves) an accommodating police escort, menacing in his black helmet, riot suit, and protective body shield, gallantly held the hand of an elderly female Trumper as she sidestepped her way down the Capitol stairs. The tough love the left has come to expect from police at demonstrations was, in the Washington invaded by Trumpists, long on the love and rather short on the tough.\n\nThis is not surprising. Officials at the Capitol and the higher-ups responsible for policing and calling out the National Guard, not to mention many, many cops, are themselves part of Trump's base of support. Police associations, all the more so in a climate of antagonism to the brutality and killing that has made Black Lives Matter into a public watchword, are often committed to Trump's agenda.\n\nThe cops eat up Trump's ratcheted-up rhetoric of coming down hard on urban violence, always coded in racialized terms. They clearly enjoy the President's mockery of a liberal establishment regarded as far too soft on crime and cosmopolitan decay. Police forces in Seattle, New York, Philadelphia, and smaller cities and towns are now acting on tips identifying off-duty cops from their ranks involved in the riotous activities inside the Capitol Building.\n\nIt is not surprising, then, that the messaging among the protesters and within broad swaths of the police was that this demonstration was to be given a certain license of a kind that a left-led initiative would never have been granted. Both sides - cops and those storming the Capitol - were perhaps captive of Trump's capacity to foster illusion. People died as a consequence.\n\nThe failures of the police are now subject to denunciation from politicians and pundits. Heads have already rolled; resignations of people in positions of responsibility are trotted out daily. Mainstream liberal commentary rightly points out that if the protesters had been associated with Black Lives Matter they would have been handled far more roughly.\n\nLargely peaceful BLM protesters were arrested and manhandled, tear-gassed, fired on with rubber bullets, and bounced off sidewalks for simply looking askance at the police. Trump's rampaging crowd, in contrast, was at times given a wink and a nod. If some cops were forced to fight, and even appeared to have gotten the worst of it, there were police inside the Capitol and on its steps who clearly had little appetite for battling back the protest.\n\nIt is not wrong to make this comparison between the unequal treatment of blacks and whites. But it is now so self-righteously commonplace that it veers toward the myopic. Nancy Pelosi has declared that the insurrectionists chose \"their whiteness over democracy.\" Joy Reid, an MSNBC newscaster, insisted that the Trump throng enjoyed and indeed consciously exploited their white privilege.\n\nThe danger with this kind of interpretation, as the scholar Adolph Reed would point out, is that it obscures as much as it illuminates. That white supremacy was at work among those rallying to Trump and assailing those who would deny his false claims on the presidency is undeniable. That this was the entirety of what happened on January 6 is, however, unconvincing. It misses important dimensions of what was going on.\n\nWhat privileged the Trump crowd in the eyes of many cops was less the color of the protesters' skin - as white as they undoubtedly were - and more their politics of right-wing indignation and demand for redress of a plethora of grievances. Race was undoubtedly an important component of this political disaffection, but a lot more was also swirling in the witch's brew on which the Trump crowd was drunk and disorderly. It was the totality of this concoction that softened up some of the cops.\n\nMany white protesters have found themselves on the wrong, and occasionally lethal, side of law's vengeance. From the time of the execution of the Haymarket martyrs of 1886 and before, whiteness has not bought class struggle militants of the Left a pass as they challenge the power of capital and the state. Militant working-class revolutionaries, such as the members of the Industrial Workers of the World - white, black, immigrant, Mexican-American, and of mixed ancestry such as Frank Little - were tarred and feathered, castrated, hung from bridge trestles, and run out of town.\n\nNot all whites enjoy the privilege of their skin color when confronting police or the retribution of extra-legal posses and menacing night riders. Striking men and women aspiring to establish and sustain trade unions have been shot down by cops, punctuating the struggle for collective bargaining rights with blood. Left demonstrations, their ranks composed of a multiethnic, multiracial coalition of dissenters, have routinely been brutalized by police, as many veterans of the 1930s, the 1960s, and activists of more recent years well know.\n\nForgetting this formidable and ongoing history is something more than merely a reflection of the short and limiting memory of television newscasters and mainstream politicians, who generally have the historical attention span of a two-year-old. What it signifies is the capacity of a liberal mainstream to soapbox on the political terrain that it sees as respectable and justified, defending a politics of racial inclusion (which no leftist would oppose) that is nonetheless presented in ways that obliterates both the history of a left-wing politics of challenge and the state's universally heavy-handed response to this.\n\nThe state and its considerable apparatus of repression responded to Trump's supporters with an incoherence bred of ambivalence. Trump's legions seemed to some in positions of power and to many rank-and-file Capitol police and others as sympatico with their generalized belief system, which of course contains unhealthy doses of racism as well as a melange of other reactionary ideological vices. The result was that a riot that could easily have been contained was not. This, too, serves specific interests.\n\nIt now suits a ruling order confronting a Trump who has clearly gone too far to designate January 6, 2021 an insurrection. Labelling the Capitol riot in this way makes it almost impossible for Trump to retain his hold on the entirety of the Republican Party, insures that there are amped up justifications for his displacement, and reinforces the likelihood that, his utility now exhausted, he can be marginalized, relegated to the chat rooms of the conspiracy-driven fringe right.\n\nTrump, of course, may well rise again, Phoenix-like, from the detritus of conflagrations of his own making. He has done this before. Nonetheless, it is entirely possible that his finest hour, if it can be described as such, has long passed. That said, we shouldn't be spreading his ashes just yet.\n\nThe sad and tragic reality is that it is our ashes that are being scattered. Caught in the vice grip of a pandemic and a ravaged economy, impaled on racial divides that seem too enduring, too wide, and too fraught to breach, the political tea leaves can only be read with difficulty, lost as they are in the dark swirl of events. The landscape of the future, to the extent that it can be glimpsed at all, looks barren and bleak. For whatever Trump's fate, Trumpism and worse is not going away.\n\nThe rise of the organized extreme right, from groups like Patriot Prayer and the Proud Boys to the Traditionalist Worker Party, Oath Keepers, and the Three Percenters, shows no sign of abating. Trump has legitimized such ugliness, and the Capitol riot will only further embolden militarized expressions of American fascism, racism, antisemitism, and the most extreme right-wing embrace of capital's ideology of acquisitive individualism.\n\nTo rely on the Democratic Party of Joe Biden to move us out of the current crisis is no less illusory than the irrational faith Trump's legions of combatants place in their chief. It is likely to end in the same disappointment, disillusionment, and despair.\n\nAs for the mainstream embrace of security forces and counterterrorism as the guardians of stability, let us not forget that the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), established in 1938 on the eve of World War II to investigate disloyalty, subversive activities, and organizations with ostensible fascist or communist ties, spent an obligatory, metaphorical few hours addressing the far right, and then trained its sights, for decades, on the Left.\n\nThe Smith Act of the early 1940s set criminal penalties for advocating the overthrow of the US government, and Communist leader Earl Browder provided the prosecution of the Minneapolis Teamsters' leaders and their Socialist Workers Party comrades with affidavits calling for the jailing of \"a Trotskyite Fifth Column.\" Less than a decade later, the Smith Act would be used to repeatedly bring to trial and sentence to jail over a hundred thirty communists, including Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, Eugene Dennis, and Claudia Jones.\n\nThe FBI now tracking down as many of the Capitol rioters as it can identify has a long history of concentrating its fire power on the Left and giving the Right a pass. The Bureau had a less than exemplary record of taking on the White Citizens' Council and Klan members, some of whom were cops, who terrorized and killed civil rights campaigners and Congress of Racial Equality Freedom Riders like Medgar Evers, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner in Mississippi in 1963-64.\n\nJ. Edgar Hoover was always more interested in Martin Luther King's and Bayard Rustin's sex lives, or Abbie Hoffman's and David Dellinger's so-called conspiracies, which the Bureau always linked to the ubiquitous threat of communism. This was more important than putting the likes of Byron De La Beckwith, well-known to have murdered Evers, in jail.\n\nIf the situation is now different in 2021, Trump has so hollowed out the \"security and intelligence\" apparatus of the state, which has been directed to concentrate its energies on foreign terrorists, that it remains to be seen just what will be done about right-wing extremists. A long history suggests that while the crisis of the moment dictates directing the state's security resources and personnel toward the Right, this focus will, inevitably, shift back to the Left.\n\nOne thing only is certain. Unless there is a substantive organized left response to the contemporary impasse in bourgeois politics - decidedly lacking in our present conjuncture - nothing good can come of where we are now. January 6, 2021 has made this clear, at the same time as it has given liberal emissaries privileged ground on which to make their stand in defense of capitalism and its ostensibly democratic order.\n\nBryan D.

In fact, Orbán's kleptocracy offers a grim indication of what far-right ideologues would do in the US if they had the chance.\n\nTucker Carlson and Hungarian premier Viktor Orbán in Budapest, Hungary, in early August 2021.\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nTucker Carlson and Viktor Orbán sit at a round wooden table, polished to a mirror finish. Behind them is a grand bookcase full of elegantly bound anthologies. The Fox News host is seated in front of a metal spiral staircase, like in an Ivy League library. The Hungarian prime minister sits in front of a massive national flag.\n\n\"Hundreds of thousands of migrants stream into the EU every year,\" says Carlson. \"And the rest of the EU says 'Welcome, please come.' Hungary stands alone in saying no. Why?\"\n\n\"Well,\" replies Orbán. \"That was the only reasonable position.\" He pauses for a moment. \"You have to defend your border. You have to say, 'Guys, stop!'\"\n\n\"And you think you have a right to do that?\" Carlson presses.\n\n\"Of course! It's coming from God, from nature,\" replies Orbán. \"Because this is our country. This is our population. This is our history. This is our language. So we have to do that.\"\n\n\"Saying what you just said,\" says Carlson, \"I think [that] will make sense to a lot of our viewers.\"\n\nCarlson broadcast his Fox News cable show from Budapest, Hungary, throughout the week of August 4. Tucker Carlson Tonight draws in an average viewership of 4.33 million, making it the highest-rated cable news show in US history. Carlson spent the week touring Budapest, visiting Hungary's border fence , and sitting down for multiple interview segments with Orbán, the hard-right prime minister who has ruled the central European country since 2010. On Saturday, August 7, Carlson spoke at the Mathias Corvinus Collegium (or MCC) Festival - a weekend of ultraconservative speakers hosted by the college that Orbán created in the hopes of fostering a new conservative elite.\n\nCarlson's visit to Hungary highlights the global nature of the current growth of nationalist ideology, white supremacist beliefs, and anti-migrant fearmongering. This trend is being capitalized on by authoritarian populists around the world to cement their power - and is fueling the Republican party's evolution toward an embrace of fascism .\n\nAfter spending the last half decade as a mouthpiece for Donald Trump, Carlson has elegantly transferred his allegiance to Orbán, cast as the \"Western-style conservative leader\" US voters should seek out. Presenting Hungary as a right-wing paradise does not just further Carlson's ideological manipulation of his viewers - it also allows him to reach an international viewership potentially vulnerable to his brand of misinformation. For him, Orbán's illiberal Hungary represents a blueprint for successfully subverting a consolidated liberal democracy - and a glimpse into what a more competent version of Trump might be able to achieve.\n\nSitting down with Carlson and approving his invitation to the MCC conference, Orbán also hoped to expand his own audience. This is a crucial step in his plan to establish the small country as a center for global far-right, white supremacist ideological and cultural production. A recent declaration \"protecting sovereignty\" signed by ultraconservative as well as \" identitarian \" political forces from across the EU seems to suggest that such a far-right international is indeed taking shape - with Orbán playing a key role.\n\nThe kind of authoritarian populism promoted by Orbán also appeals to broad swaths of the US right. While Carlson is known for his open support of Trump, this is what the Washington Post 's Philip Bump calls \"sycophancy-adjacent rather than entirely immersed in the MAGAverse.\" The key to Carlson's support of Trump, Bump elaborates, is that \"Trump shares many of his core philosophies, like preserving institutional power for white Americans.\"\n\nIn this sense, a notable connection to Orbán lies in \" replacement theory \" - the racist conspiracy theory postulating that white people and their culture will be driven to extinction and overtaken by immigrants of color. As far back as 2017, Carlson used his platform to argue that US Democrats \"know if they keep up the flood of illegals into the country, they can eventually turn it into a flood of voters for them.\" The Democrats \"don't have to foster economic growth,\" Carlson continued, \"or be capable administrators, or provide good government. They just have to keep the pump flowing, and power will be theirs.\"\n\nUnder Orbán's leadership, replacement theory is official state ideology. Not only was this same theme reflected in his address to the Budapest Demographic Summit in 2019, but it is also the stuff of propaganda leaflets regularly sent by the government to all Hungarian households.\n\nIf often resorting to subtler language, conservative US figures draw on this same theory. Earlier this year, House representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar were linked to a plan to create an \" America First \" caucus, centered around a belief in \"Anglo-Saxon political traditions,\" and specifically argued that when immigrants are \"imported\" into the US \"en masse,\" it threatens American culture's \"long-term existential future.\"\n\nThe political influence of this ideology can hardly be understated: an April 2021 survey by GOP pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson \" found that nearly half of Republican respondents believe politics is about 'ensuring the country's survival as we know it'\" and that \"there is a 'real sense in the Republican coalition today that they are under siege.'\"\n\nWith such clear affinities, it's no wonder Steve Bannon once called the Hungarian premier \" Trump before Trump. \" Orbán has cemented his power around the idea that a pure, ethnically homogeneous nation must be preserved from outside attacks. While he refrains from openly talking about race, it is blatantly obvious what he means when he talks about \"homogeneity\" and the preservation of \"Judeo-Christian civilization\" from a planned invasion organized by shadowy forces, like NGOs supported by George Soros. Orbán is careful not to openly endorse Nazi groups, particularly given the importance of his alliance with the Israeli far righ t . Rather, in the thirty years since Soviet troops left the country, Orbán's Fidesz party has strategically built itself on a foundation of right-wing authoritarian populist ideology that has become popular with despots around the world.\n\nThe transferability of this message shone through from the Hungarian premier's conversation with Carlson. \"This is our country, this is our population,\" Orbán tells the Fox News host. \"This is our history; this is our language. . . . You can't say simply [say,] 'It's a nice country, and I would like to come and live here because it's a nicer life.' [There] is not a human right to come here, because it's our land. It's a nation. It's a community. Family. History. Tradition. Language.\"\n\n\"Oooh . . . they're so triggered by that!\" replies Carlson. \"'Family. History. Tradition. Language.' They hate it when you say that. But why? Those are all good things!\"\n\nSince taking power in 2010, Orbán and the Fidesz party have overseen Hungary's slide into kleptocracy and authoritarianism. This \" hybrid regime \" has the trappings of representative government - a parliament, elections, some form of media - but in practice, it has been entrenched into a centralized, top-down power structure dominated by Orbán's close associates.\n\nAfter Fidesz won 68 percent of seats in parliament in 2010, granting it a so-called supermajority, Orbán was able to replace Hungary's constitution with an \"alaptörény\" - a set of \"fundamental laws.\" In 2014, he declared Hungary an \"illiberal democracy,\" arguing that liberal values today represent \" corruption, sex, and violence .\" Today, the electoral watchdog Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) deems Hungary's elections free but not fair , making Hungary a \" ballot box autocracy \" in which authoritarians design and use manipulative practices such as widespread gerrymandering and a controlled media environment to ensure their continued power.\n\nCarlson is eager to introduce his viewers to Orbán because he is so easily compared to Trump. And the Hungarian premier is only too keen to return the favor. \"Donald Trump was a great friend of Hungary,\" the prime minister tells Carlson. \"He was very supportive of us. Not just personally but politically also. . . . 'America First' is a very positive message in Central Europe. Because it means if, for Donald Trump, 'America First,' it means that, for us, Hungary could be first as well.\"\n\nAs well as describing the European Parliament as a group of \" useful idiots ,\" Orbán has especially criticized EU migration policy. In 2015, when refugees from Africa and the Middle East came to Hungary's border via what is sometimes called the Balkan route , Orbán began to demonize them as well, building a fence along the border with Serbia, where asylum-seekers faced severe human rights abuses . During his time in Budapest, Carlson visited this same fence in person and was clearly impressed - calling the border \"peaceful\" with \"no suffering mass of humanity.\" For him, it showed that Hungary has \"no desire to destroy itself\" and \"no desire to encourage crime and misery and unemployment in its cities.\"\n\nIn Carlson's portrayal, Hungary is an \"obvious success.\" \"There's an option to the chaos and crime and filth growing all around us,\" Carlson tells his viewers. \"We don't have to live like that anymore; actually, we could have a functioning country [like Hungary]. All we'd have to do is uphold our own laws. . . . Other smaller countries, far less privileged places, have figured this out.\"\n\nTo emphasize his point, Carlson airs footage of downtown Budapest taken by his film crew.\n\n\"There are not tent cities of drug addicts living in the parks here,\" he says. \"There isn't garbage and human waste littering the sidewalks. People don't get beheaded at intersections. BLM is not allowed to torch entire neighborhoods in Budapest. That's how Americans used to live before our leaders decided they no longer care about you. The Hungarian government protects its border because it wants to protect its citizens.\"\n\nIt speaks volumes about Carlson's lack of professional integrity that he makes no mention of the areas where he and Orbán hold wildly divergent views. For instance, while Carlson calls China a threat to the West, Orbán has an excellent relationship with the Chinese Communist Party and is determined to allow Fudan University to open a campus in Budapest. Tellingly, when Carlson did voice criticism of Xi Jinping, not only did Orbán avoid responding, but the Hungarian government simply censored this comment from the state copy of the interview transcript. Orbán's administration similarly tried to block a recent EU statement critical of China's actions in Hong Kong.\n\nCarlson - who frequently cries censorship and claims that voices like his are silenced by \"Joe Biden's allies within Silicon Valley\" - has not responded to this omission. This is yet another indication of how Carlson is using Hungary to project internal US politics - it doesn't truly matter to him if he disagrees with the reality of Orbán's government.\n\nThis is also apparent on the question of COVID-19 vaccines and whether people should be compelled to take them. While Carlson did cast scientifically unfounded doubts about the efficacy of vaccines and considers vaccine passes a violation of freedom, Orbán was one of the first leaders in Europe to introduce such a pass, without which people cannot access a number of indoor venues.\n\nThere are other gaping holes in Carlson's account. It is true that, compared to the United States , Hungary has relatively low levels of violent crime . This is likely due to several factors, including significantly lower levels of gun ownership . Indeed, Carlson conveniently fails to recognize the fact that other EU countries, including those that embrace multiculturalism, also have significantly lower rates of violent crime than the United States. As for homelessness, Carlson does not mention that, up until 2018, Hungary had one of the largest per capita populations of people living on the streets in the EU. What changed that year was that Orbán's Fidesz party used its power to amend Hungary's \"fundamental laws\" to make homelessness illegal . Thirty thousand unhoused people across Hungary, many of them in Budapest, were forced to either find housing or face imprisonment, where they are required to labor for the state (indeed, incarcerated labor was used to build the border fence that Carlson so admired) .\n\nCarlson nonetheless claims to be speaking truth to power. Addressing the MCC Festival, Carlson told the crowd that, as a cable news show, \"We have no real power other than to talk unimpeded, which is an increasingly rare luxury in the United States.\" Carlson frequently bemoans the state of press freedom in the United States - claiming that all media is beholden to what the \"liberal establishment\" (the Biden administration, at the moment) tells it to do. It is indeed true that US media is increasingly beholden to corporate monopolies. But as Carlson sees it, Fox News is the only accurate, unbiased media source willing to defy the journalistic establishment. And he compares American  media consolidation with that of Hungary, where hundreds of formerly private news outlets were simultaneously \" donated \" by their owners to a central company run by Orbán's close personal friends - all in a single day in 2018.\n\nBut for the Fox News host, the Hungarian press is, if anything, far freer than its US counterpart.  He continues his MCC speech, reading a tweet from Atlantic staff writer Anne Applebaum from his phone . \"In Orbán's Hungary, 90 percent of the media is controlled by the ruling party. Businesses are repeatedly harassed if they don't toe the party line. Elections are manipulated. Party leaders are mysteriously rich.\" A ripple of laughter passes through the crowd. \"And I said to myself,\" Carlson continues, \"'Wait a minute! I live in that country!'\"\n\nOrbán's regime clearly sought to use the visit by a famous international personality for domestic propaganda purposes - and Carlson did him a great favor in casting him as the defender of a \"normalcy\" America has lost. Orbán shared multiple posts about his meeting with Carlson on his social media platform, and the Fidesz-aligned new network Hír TV broadcast Carlson's entire MCC lecture.\n\nBut not everyone in Hungary was impressed. One of the country's few remaining independent news websites, 444.hu , described it as \"one of those rare events that take place in Hungary yet attract greater attention in America than in Hungary.\" There was, nonetheless, strong criticism. When Carlson asked Orbán about how he feels about Joe Biden calling him a totalitarian thug, Orbán claimed that such statements are an insult to the Hungarian people. Responding to this, Budapest's green mayor, Gergely Karácsony, said that the real insult is not what Biden said but the fact that the prime minister of Hungary is indeed a totalitarian thug.\n\nIt is important to note that, while Orbán and his Fidesz government are kleptocratic authoritarians, Hungary is still far from a totalitarian system enacting total control over citizens' everyday lives. Yet through policies like encouraging white, Hungarian, Christian families to have more children to combat the supposed decline of the white population, the prime minister does push a harsh identitarianism, in explicit counterposition to Western liberal democracy. Orbán told Carlson that Hungary is the alternative of choice for the \"millions and millions of people who disagree with the direction of the policy taken at this moment,\" policy that is \"against protecting the families\" and \"based on migration,\" that is \"welfare-oriented,\" and that is more \"Open Society\" - a reference to George Soros's nonprofit organization promoting civil society.\n\nOrbán has been pushing to transform Hungary into this alternative - with a particular emphasis on fostering right-wing culture and academia. Mathias Corvinus Collegium, the school hosting the event that Carlson spoke at this past weekend along with leaders within the international conservative community like Dennis Prager of PragerU , is a centerpiece of this agenda. The school, which was originally founded in 1996 to train Hungary's elite in a post-Soviet world, has become one of the thirty-two conservative, government-affiliated organizations in Hungary. This network includes foundations, think tanks, parks, concert halls, a cinema, and even a boarding school. These organizations receive billions of dollars annually in public funding - despite being privately owned and run. Orban allocated $1.7 billion USD to MCC at the height of the COVID-19 crisis, about 1 percent of the country's GDP .\n\nThis comes on the heels of Orbán's attempt to dismantle both higher education and any kind of dissident academic thinking. Orbán has banned gender studies in Hungary, forced the expulsion of the Central European University, an international school cofounded by George Soros, and seized control of Hungary's five largest public universities .\n\nOrbán envisions Hungary as a right-wing paradise - as he tells Carlson, a central hub within a more extensive international network of \"conservative and Christian Democrat thinkers.\" That is why, Orbán says, \"Ordinary citizens are moving to Central European countries,\" like Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. Even as Hungary closes its borders to asylum-seekers, it is opening its arms to the \"many Christian families and conservative families who think that Western Europe is not secure enough, [that] the future is unstable.\"\n\n\"There will be a new migration,\" the prime minister tells Carlson, by \"the Christians and the Conservatives trying to find a better home.\"\n\nFor the Fox News star who claims to love America, the hope is to make his home a bit more like Hungary.\n\nRosa Schwartzburg was a Fulbright Scholar to the Netherlands in 2018 and received her MA from the Central European University in Budapest. She is currently at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.\n\nImre Szijarto is a Hungarian activist, writer, and MA student at the Central European University.

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nThe line between the far right and \"mainstream\" conservatism is rapidly crumbling. But the two were never very far apart in the first place.\n\nCongressman Steve King of Iowa speaking at the 2013 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland. Gage Skidmore / Flickr.\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIf you go by most of what you see in the media, you would think politics is governed by some strange version of Newtonian physics. \"Both sides\" are perennially to blame, and if there's ever dangerous excesses on one end of the political spectrum, then they must of course be evened out by the existence of equally dangerous excesses on the other end.\n\nIt's why, after George Soros was mailed a bomb, Chuck Schumer felt the need to announce that \"despicable acts of violence and harassment are being carried out by radicals across the political spectrum.\" And why the New York Times , after more explosives were sent to individuals hated by the Trump-loving Right, decided the explosives were adding \"to [a] climate of overheated partisan rancor.\"\n\nYet we're now at a moment when it's indisputable that only one of these \"sides\" has actually become a vehicle for dangerous, violent extremism.\n\nI'm speaking about the quickly fading line between the far Right and \"mainstream\" conservatism. This isn't really a new phenomenon. The dividing line between US conservatism and fringe bigots of various kinds has always been pretty flimsy; the old, \"respectable\" conservatism represented by William F. Buckley and pined for by today's centrist pundits was also a deeply racist one. It's not a mystery why the Klan endorsed Ronald Reagan for president twice.\n\nBut just consider some of the events of the past few weeks. The \"theory\" that the bombs sent by Trump superfan Cesar Sayoc were a \"false flag\" orchestrated by the Left quickly moved from far right internet message boards to being broadcast by \"mainstream\" conservatives , including Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, Lou Dobbs, Michael Savage, various Fox News guests, and even a Republican lawmaker, Matt Gaetz. Gaetz, along with \"mainstream\" conservatives like Newt Gingrich, also floated the idea that the thousands of Central American migrants traveling to Mexico and the US-Mexican border were being funded by some mysterious agent of chaos. One of these conservatives was pundit and prolific conspiracy theorist Erick Erickson , who for some reason was invited this past Sunday onto Meet the Press where he play-acted as a sober moderate and lectured conservatives to drop the crazy talk.\n\nIt called to mind the recent episode in which conservative legal thinker Ed Whelan invented an alternative \"explanation\" for Brett Kavanaugh's alleged assault of Christine Blasey Ford that involved a Kavanaugh doppelgänger, defaming an innocent man in the process. It also calls to mind that, even now, a majority of Republicans believe Obama was born in Kenya.\n\nThis is far from the only recent instance of crossover between the far and \"mainstream\" Right. British far-right figure Stephen Yaxley-Lennon (a.k.a. \"Tommy Robinson\") was invited by Republican congressman Paul Gosar to speak to the Conservative Opportunity Society, a group of right-wing House Republicans founded by Steve King. This is only a few months after Gosar traveled to London and spoke in support of Yaxley-Lennon at a protest peopled with other far-right figures, where he called Muslim men a \"scourge.\" The Arizona GOP said nothing .\n\nSpeaking of Steve King - the Republican congressman who, whoopsie daisy, just happens to somehow constantly retweet , meet with , and sound exactly like neo-Nazis - his \"mainstream\" colleagues seem to have a hard time condemning him. Here's a parade of local GOP officials defending King and whitewashing his various racist comments (\"he's a godly, upright man\"; \"I think that he says what he means\";\"maybe it's crude, maybe a little mean, but it gets the point across\"). One GOP county chair, when asked if King's statement that \"we can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies\" was racist, responded: \"I think it's a reality.\" (The head of the Republican Congressional fundraising arm did finally criticize King on Tuesday.)\n\nKing has helpfully made clear an obvious truth that would be considered too \"partisan\" if uttered by anyone in the media. Referring to the Freedom Party of Austria, a far-right party of actual Nazis , King said: \"If they were in America pushing the platform that they push, they would be Republicans.\" And he's not wrong: this November features a gaggle of real-life, no-kidding neo-Nazis and white supremacists running as GOP nominees.\n\nMeanwhile, the Proud Boys, a ridiculous but nonetheless violent fascist gang led by Vice founder Gavin McInnes, have been welcomed into the Republican Party fold, with McInnes invited by the Metropolitan Republican Club of New York City - traditionally a hub for the GOP's establishment elite - to give a lecture. The talk involved McInnes re-enacting the 1960 assassination of Japanese Socialist Party leader Inejiro Asanuma, complete with caricatured Asian eyes, and concluding, \"Never let evil take root,\" a line reportedly met with hooting and cheering by the Republican audience. The Proud Boys also acted as \"security\" for Joe Gibson, a far-right activist who was briefly a Republican Senate candidate from Washington, and a recent protest by the gang was organized by a local GOP official in Florida.\n\nWe can also see this shift in Fox News, the most popular and powerful media arm of the conservative movement. Fox has long been a bastion of racist dog-whistling, as Megyn Kelly's tenure at the network can attest, but it's recently opted to swap the dog whistle for a bullhorn. Tucker Carlson runs shows about the dangers of Roma immigration and supposed anti-white discrimination in South Africa, while Laura Ingraham told viewers that \"massive demographic changes have been foisted upon the American people\" through both illegal and legal immigration, and that \"the America that we know and love doesn't exist anymore\" in parts of the country. Earlier this week, Fox & Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade suggested that the migrants headed toward the US are carrying unnamed \"diseases,\" which Toronto Star reporter Daniel Dale accurately called \"a staple of racist and anti-semitic incitement for hundreds of years.\"\n\nBut the fact that Fox has never been far from these more alarmingly explicit appeals to racism is key, because the same goes for \"mainstream\" conservatism. As the Left has been at pains to point out for the past three years, other than on trade and some aspects of foreign policy, there is very little real substantive difference between Trump and \"mainstream\" conservatives, which is why Republicans, including his fiercest \"opponents\" , vote almost exactly in line with Trump's policy positions most of the time. It's also why Trump's approval ratings are sky-high among Republicans and why \"mainstream\" conservatives have walked back their previous disapproval of Trump and now declare they're \"thrilled\" with him. As one pollster has said , the \"Never-Trump\" Republicans that tend to appear on TV and in op-ed pages don't really exist in real life.\n\nTake a look at the recent midterms, which have seen the entire GOP heavily stoking racism in advance of voting day. The Congressional Leadership Fund super PAC, affiliated with House speaker Paul Ryan and the GOP leadership, has been running some breathtakingly racist ads . But the GOP's \"moderate\" elements have been flirting with extremism for a while now.\n\nHatred of refugees, which motivated the latest far-right terrorist attack, was stoked by the \"mainstream\" Right in 2015, when 31 governors (all but one of them Republican) refused to resettle any Syrian refugees in their states. Hapless \"moderate\" Jeb Bush suggested letting in only the Christian ones. The following year, Ted Cruz, then another \"moderate\" alternative to Donald Trump, ran a campaign ad that was essentially Willie Horton for immigrant communities.\n\nThe Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), the annual confluence of \"mainstream\" conservatism's brightest lights, has for many years been a cesspool of far-right talking points, ideas, and figures. Figures like Pamela Geller and Frank Gaffney were fixtures for years (Gaffney, a conspiratorial, anti-Muslim hate-monger, was also an adviser to Ted Cruz in 2016, and other GOP hopefuls that year lined up to be associated with him). Geert Wilders, the far-right Dutch politician, turned up once at CPAC to a forty-second standing ovation. This was the same year Wilders had been invited to the Capitol by Jon Kyl, the extremely conservative Republican former congressman who was considered a \"pragmatic\" choice to fill John McCain's seat in Arizona.\n\n\"Mainstream\" conservatism's connections to the far right go further than this, however. It's the family of conservative magnate Richard Mellon Scaife - considered \"mainstream\" enough for Bill Clinton to eulogize in 2014 - who became the single biggest funders of the anti-immigration movement. Likewise, it's a constellation of the largest \"mainstream\" conservative donors who bankroll the country's most virulent purveyors of Islamophobia, some of whom make up today's \"alt-Right.\"\n\nIn fact, Islamophobia - something of a gateway drug to outright white supremacy - has for a good while been a tolerated, if not accepted , part of \"mainstream\" conservative politics. The racist hysteria over the so-called \"Ground Zero Mosque\" in 2010, was fanned by \"mainstream\" conservatives like Newt Gingrich, Sarah Palin, currently outgoing Florida governor Rick Scott , then-gubernatorial candidate Rick Lazio , and many more . Peter King was a solidly \"mainstream\" Republican when he embarked on his series of congressional hearings into American Muslims, which were defended by conservatives like Joe Lieberman. Republican congresspeople in 2012 attended anti-Muslim rallies and demanded an investigation into what they believed was Muslim Brotherhood \"infiltration\" of the State Department. This hunch was based on the fact that Huma Abedin, who is of Indian and Pakistani heritage, worked there.\n\nSo when we see headlines these days about Republicans palling around with Islamophobic extremists or warning about sinister Muslim infiltration, it's alarming - but it's also where the party's been heading for a long time.\n\nOr take the president's latest extremist policy: his pledge to end birthright citizenship. The \"mainstream\" Right beat Trump to the punch on this issue a while ago. \"Mainstream\" conservatives were fretting about \"anchor babies\" more than a decade ago, and it was in 2010 that Lindsey Graham first proposed changing the Fourteenth Amendment to stop what he called a tactic of \"drop and leave\" by migrants. In fact, Republican legislators have been pushing to end birthright citizenship for decades, introducing bills to undo it in every single Congress since 1991. They've been cheered along in these efforts by \"mainstream\" conservative intellectuals like the Heritage Foundation and George Will .\n\nThere's so much more one could point to, including the fact that that the current right-wing conspiracy theories about George Soros were pushed for years by \"mainstream\" conservatives. The point is, their recent, more explicit alignment with the far right is not due to some hostile \"takeover\" by Trump. All he's done is opportunistically jump on tendencies that were alive and well in \"mainstream\" conservatism for years. Jeff Sessions, after all, isn't some racist imp conjured out of some dark, racist portal; he was an Alabama senator for two decades.\n\nIn fact, the \"mainstream\" Right quite openly told us who they were. The Department of Homeland Security sharply drew down its investigation into far right extremism at the start of Obama's presidency because of furious objections from \"mainstream\" conservatives, after a report on the subject was produced in 2009. John Boehner, the Republican House minority leader at the time, said the DHS was targeting \"American citizens who disagree with the direction Washington Democrats are taking our nation.\" Rush Limbaugh said the report was singling out \"ordinary, everyday conservatives.\" Michelle Malkin complained it \"demonizes the very Americans who will be protesting in the thousands on Wednesday for the nationwide Tax Day Tea Party.\"\n\nIn other words, \"mainstream\" conservatives angrily went to bat for far right extremists, explicitly aligning themselves and their own supporters with those of far right movements, and quashing investigative work into terrorist networks that have only gotten more dangerous since then.\n\nIt's all led to this point, where the barrier (if it ever really existed) between the far right and \"mainstream\" conservatism is rapidly crumbling. Centrists can talk about both sides, but socialists - besides being in the habit of calling for free healthcare instead of ethnic cleansing - have nowhere near the presence, ideological influence, or general sway in the Democratic Party as the far right does in the GOP. Whatever polarization is happening, it's mostly happening on the side sprinting full-tilt toward out-and-out fascism.\n\nCentrists and liberal technocrats pride themselves on their adherence to evidence-based analysis and objectivity. They also maintain a fastidious aversion to anything that might seem partisan or divisive. But these two things are incompatible. The Republican Party is a far-right party, and it's only going to become more extreme. Will establishment politicians and media finally start acknowledging this reality? Or will they continue to soft-pedal the truth for the sake of political decorum?\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .

      "text": "Paul Gosar Is Why Censure Exists\n\nTom Williams/CQ Roll Call via ZUMA\n\nOn Wednesday, the House of Representatives voted to censure Arizona Republican Rep. Paul Gosar and strip him of his committee assignments. First elected in 2012 after a long and not especially scandalous career as a dentist, Gosar has emerged from back-bencher anonymity in recent years as perhaps the chamber's least subtle white supremacist.\n\nGosar has proposed a new caucus devoted to protecting \"Anglo-Saxon political traditions\" and promoted the racist \"replacement\" theory, which contends that an \" invasion \" of non-white immigrants will destroy America's foundations. Gosar has been a superspreader of false election conspiracies and reportedly worked with the organizers of the January 6 rally on the National Mall that served as a launching pad for the insurrection. He has shared memes popular among Neo-Nazis, and after the Washington Post reported in February that Gosar had spoke at a white nationalist conference, he justified his attendance by saying they were \"a group of young people that are becoming part of the election process, and becoming a bigger force.\" In June, the same group announced that Gosar would be doing a fundraiser for them.\n\nGosar has said and done a lot of bad stuff, but Congress as a rule is a place where a lot of people are elected to say and do bad stuff. What prompted the push for censure was more personal: In early November, Gosar tweeted an anime meme depicting Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, his Democratic colleague from New York, being murdered...by Paul Gosar. There is not really a normal time to do something like that, but this episode comes at a time when lawmakers are being inundated with death threats, and in the aftermath of a historic assault on Congress by members of Gosar's political movement. Ocasio-Cortez, a frequent target of right-wing misogynists and recipient of death threats, has spoken about how terrified she was of what would have happened if Gosar's fellow travelers had found her on January 6. That's all pretty fucked up, even for a dentist.\n\nRepublicans have been down this path before in recent years with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia (who was stripped of her committees this spring, in part for endorsing violence against Democrats in old social media posts), and ex-Rep. Steve King (who similarly aligned himself with white nationalists). Although several Republicans voted for the motion on Wednesday, the overwhelming majority of his caucus had Gosar's back. He appeared to calm Republicans' nerves at an internal caucus meeting this week. They are not looking for justice, after all; they are simply looking for assurances that one of their own can get his story straight so they don't have to keep talking about it. In this case, Gosar has said variously that he didn't actually watch the full clip he sent, and also that it was a \"a symbolic cartoon\" that was \"in no way intended to be a targeted attack against Representative Cortez or Mr Biden.\" Ideally, a reassurance that you were not threatening harm to a colleague would at least get that colleague's last name right, but with Gosar, evidently, you grade on a curve.\n\nThis is only the 24th time a member of Congress has ever been censured. But episodes like this are exactly what the process is designed for. In another context, Gosar's antagonism to his colleagues would simply get him fired, but the people who actually have that power-the voters of northern Arizona-aren't the ones who have to work with him. Congress is \"the people's House,\" as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reminded her colleagues on Wednesday, but it is also an office. And Gosar, like Taylor Greene, has helped make the Capitol an increasingly hostile workplace-one in which lawmakers menacingly pack heat, coddle insurrectionists, and taunt colleagues still traumatized by the attack. The Capitol has traditionally been a sanctuary of sorts for over-performed collegiality-fraught in its own way-but the Trump years opened the door to a baser kind of politics, relishing in its impunity and unconstrained by anything resembling personal boundaries. You could make a good case Gosar is even getting off easy; after January 6, there were calls for the members who had egged on Trump's coup attempt to be expelled-and few did as much to cheerlead that attempt as Gosar.\n\nGosar was not censured because of his views, as noxious as they are, but because of his inability to share an office with others. It was about \"workplace harassment and violence against women,\" Pelosi told her colleagues-a rebuke for crossing a line no one should have any trouble staying on the right side of. Her Republican counterpart, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, invoked purported instances of Democratic misbehavior. Such whataboutism is a preferred tactic in cases like this, because it makes simple solutions seem intractable. But it doesn't have to be that complicated. In singling Gosar out, Democrats were simply sending a message that if a 62-year-old man wants to conduct himself like a 15-year-old 8chan Nazi, then maybe he ought to be treated like one.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Why GOP Leaders Can't Keep Paul Gosar in Line\n\nGosar in the Capitol on the day of his censure, November 17 AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite\n\nFor decades, if members of Congress got carried away-if their rhetoric or votes started straying too far from the party line-they were usually quick to retreat under pressure. While there were always party factions or caucuses pursuing their own interests, party leadership expected members to cooperate. Unnecessary controversy and self-serving provocations weren't in the playbook-go along, to get along, new members were told. A key motivator was campaign finance-it didn't pay to cause trouble, literally. To secure reelection, members almost always needed help from party leaders who hold the purse strings in the House: those at the helm of the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC).\n\nThe present scandal featuring Rep. Paul Gosar, however, shows how the old methods of financial control no longer work. Gosar, who was censured by House Democrats on Wednesday over a cartoon video recently posted on his Twitter feed depicting the murder of Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, just doesn't need the money that party leaders used to leverage to keep wayward members in line.\n\nSheila Krumholz, the executive director of money-in-politics watchdog OpenSecrets, says that shift traces back to the Supreme Court decision in Citizens United , which allowed unlimited amounts of money to flow to outside spending groups, such as the super-PACs that can upend a race without notice so long as they are not coordinating with a candidate. If a member of Congress is after the big money that can help them overwhelm a competitor, Krumholz says, it's not necessarily the party leaders they're looking to for help anymore.\n\n\"Putting aside the fact that the party line that members are supposed to toe has shifted radically in recent years, it is true that both parties have less leverage now,\" Krumholz says. \"The money they used to give to favored candidates and spend on their own is now worth much less than it was before Citizens United.\"\n\nMeanwhile, efforts that GOP leaders have put into creating \"safe districts\" through gerrymandering has resulted in more and more candidates who, after winning a primary, no longer need to outspend an opponent to an overwhelming degree. Gosar, who was first elected in 2010, is case in point: During an 11-year stretch when the cost of winning a competitive race has ballooned, his campaign always raised far less than the average congressional campaign, an approach he could afford in a deep red gerrymandered district in Arizona. For the 2020 election, when the average House campaign raised $2.6 million, Gosar raised just $622,000. He won in a race that wasn't even remotely close .\n\nKrumholz says that party leaders might try and use their own affiliated super-PACs for more leverage, such as the Congressional Leadership Fund super-PAC, which has close ties to Republican House leadership. Yet, if it comes to a fight with leadership, Gosar and others who have aligned themselves closely with former president Donald Trump know they have little to fear from the traditional GOP leadership, and in particular the members that control the GOP's party committees and its donations.\n\n\"Gosar also knows that his supporters, fueled by Trump's attacks on and derision for GOP leadership, will take his side,\" Krumholz says. \"And if he needs money, he can quickly raise it via small donors from across the country, without party support.\"\n\nGosar's biggest financial backers during his political career have had no connection with the GOP establishment. Two of his top four sources of funding have been Arizona-based investment businesses: the PACs and executives of the Services Group of America, an Arizona-based investment company, and of Pinnacle West, a utility holding company. Combined, these entities and individuals have contributed more than $145,000 to Gosar's campaigns. His other two biggest funders have been trade associations affiliated with the dental industry (Gosar is a former dentist), which have contributed more than $136,000.\n\nGosar's fifth biggest funder-the closest he gets to relying on his Washington colleagues for financial support-is the House Freedom Fund, a PAC set up by Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, to support candidates who back his more fiery brand of conservative politics. The House Freedom Fund often backs GOP members who find themselves in direct opposition to the wishes of GOP leadership. The Freedom Fund has given Gosar's campaigns $30,000 and helped funnel another $26,000 to them from individual donors.\n\nAltogether, the local donors and Jordan's group have contributed significantly to Gosar's campaign finances. But ultimately Gosar may not need money to keep his prominent role in the GOP so much as another valuable currency these days: controversial attention .\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "GOP Congressman Skipped the Stimulus Vote to Appear at a White Nationalist Event\n\nBill Clark/CNP via ZUMA\n\nRep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz) skipped key votes in the House of Representatives, citing the \"ongoing public health emergency,\" to instead attend a conference hosted by white supremacists in Orlando, Florida on Friday.\n\nGosar, whose six siblings memorably endorsed his congressional opponent in a 2018 ad, has a long flirtation with far-right extremism. He appeared Friday at a white supremacist gathering in Orlando, America First Political Action Conference (AFPAC) organized by Nick Fuentes, a white nationalist figurehead and instigator of the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nGosar has fanned the flames of the Jan. 6 insurrection himself by calling the Democrats' win an attempted \"coup\" and then President-elect Joe Biden an \"illegitimate usurper.\" After the election, he wrote in an op-ed promoting the \"Stop the Steal\" rallies: \"Be ready to defend the Constitution and the White House.\" His past ties to the right-wing militia group Oath Keepers are already under scrutiny. In 2017, he dismissed right-wing violence in the deadly Charlottesville Unite the Right rally as the doing of George Soros, lying about how the billionaire known for backing progressive causes was actually behind the violence. \"Who is he?,\" Gosar said. \"I think he's from Hungary. I think he was Jewish. And I think he turned in his own people to the Nazis.\"\n\nJust after Gosar spoke on Friday, Fuentes took the mic to call the Capitol riot \"awesome\" and mocked Gosar's colleague, Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.), who uses a wheelchair.\n\nHere's another bit from the Nick Fuentes speech at AFPAC, delivered right after Rep. Paul Gosar got off the stage. Gosar's speaking at CPAC in a couple hours. Fuentes joked that he'd get a call from his lawyer afterward. pic.twitter.com/N0nX0maXrZ\n\n- Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) February 27, 2021\n\nThe keynote by Nick Fuentes at AFPAC also included jokes about @CawthornforNC , Gosar's colleague, who uses a wheelchair. Fuentes mocked how often Cawthorn says he'll \"take a stand.\"\n\n\"'I'm gonna take a stand?' How? How are you gonna do that?\"\n\n- Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) February 27, 2021\n\nOn Saturday, Gosar, at CPAC , half-heartedly tried to distance himself from the association with white supremacists, saying, \"I denounce when we talk about white racism.\"\n\nPaul Gosar kicked off his CPAC panel with a muddled attempt to distance himself from the white nationalist event last night. \"Before I get to that, I want to tell you - I denounce when we talk about white racism. That's not appropriate.\"\n\n- Will Sommer (@willsommer) February 27, 2021\n\nGosar wasn't the only member of Congress to skip Friday's House session. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fl), like Gosar, enlisted colleagues to vote by proxy, signing letters saying, \"I am unable to physically attend proceedings in the House Chamber due to the ongoing public health emergency.\" Instead, Gaetz spoke at the in-person CPAC on Friday, where the event's thousands of attendees loosely followed policies on wearing masks.\n\nThe Republicans skipped a slate of important votes, including a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus package and a public lands measure to protect 1.5 million acres of new wilderness and to protect 1,200 miles of waterways. The Republicans had their proxies oppose the bills.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "GOP Congressman Wants to Round Up \"Illegal Aliens\" at State of the Union\n\nBill Clark/ZUMA\n\nWith dozens of Democratic lawmakers planning to bring DACA recipients as guests to President Donald Trump's first State of the Union address, one Republican congressman appears hellbent on giving the Dreamers a rough welcome.\n\nJust hours before Trump's remarks Monday evening, Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), cast an ominous backdrop to the event by calling on authorities to perform identification checks and round up any undocumented immigrants attempting to attend the speech. Gosar's office said that the congressman had been in contact with Capitol Police and the Justice Department about his proposal:\n\nToday, Congressman Paul Gosar contacted the U.S. Capitol Police, as well as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, asking they consider checking identification of all attending the State of the Union address and arresting any illegal aliens in attendance.\n\n- Rep. Paul Gosar, DDS (@RepGosar) January 30, 2018\n\nAdditionally, Congressman Gosar asked that they arrest those using fraudulent social security numbers and identification to pass through security.\n\n- Rep. Paul Gosar, DDS (@RepGosar) January 30, 2018\n\n\"Of all the places where the Rule of Law needs to be enforced, it should be in the hallowed halls of Congress. Any illegal aliens attempting to go through security, under any pretext of invitation or otherwise, should be arrested and deported,\" said Congressman Gosar.\n\n- Rep. Paul Gosar, DDS (@RepGosar) January 30, 2018\n\nIt's unlikely any such checks will occur, but Gosar's suggestion echoes a recent editorial from Fox News columnist Todd Starnes that urged Trump to have Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials at the ready during the State of Union address.\n\n\"Imagine the message he could send to the world if he directed ICE agents to arrest every illegal alien in the House chamber-live on national television,\" Starnes wrote.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "How Trump Spread Incitement of Violence Throughout the GOP\n\nMark Follman NOVEMBER+DECEMBER 2022 ISSUE\n\nDaniel Zender\n\nDaniel Zender\n\nJust hours after federal agents entered Mar-a-Lago on August 8 to seize highly classified national security documents, Rep. Paul Gosar urged a fight to the finish. \"The FBI raid on Trump's home tells us one thing,\" the far-right Arizona congressman tweeted . \"Failure is not an option. We must destroy the FBI.\"\n\nThree days later, an Ohio man named Ricky Shiffer donned tactical gear, armed himself with an AR-15, and went to the FBI field office in Cincinnati. After failing to breach the facility, he fled and later died in a shootout with law enforcement. Shiffer was a frequent user of Trump's Truth Social site, where the ex-president has kept up steady attacks on political opponents and the Justice Department and FBI. Shiffer had posted about imminent violence, telling fellow Trump supporters to be ready \"to jump into civil war.\"\n\n\"People, this is it,\" Shiffer wrote shortly after the Mar-a-Lago news broke. A Navy veteran who claimed he was also at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, he called for stocking up at gun stores with \"whatever you need to be ready for combat.\" He also said \"patriots are heading to Palm Beach\" and should kill any federal agents who try to stop them.\n\nWas Shiffer spurred to attack the FBI by the statements from Trump and Gosar? It's hard to know, and that's no accident. Shiffer's actions point to a rhetorical method experts call \" stochastic terrorism ,\" whereby a leader vilifies a person or group in ways likely to instigate random supporters to attack those targets, while the instigator maintains a veneer of plausible deniability. Trump made this form of incitement a hallmark of his presidency, galvanizing extremists by railing against and dehumanizing his \"enemies.\" The country saw the devastating consequences when his supporters stormed Congress to obstruct certification of the presidential election. And now a growing number of Republicans are emulating Trump's technique.\n\n\"While these attacks may defy specific predictability,\" threat assessment experts Molly Amman and Reid Meloy wrote in a 2021 study in the journal Perspectives on Terrorism , \"their likelihood is greatly increased by the public demon­ization process.\" Repetition and saturation through social media and news coverage further amplifies the effect, they observed.\n\nViolent threats have surged since Trump and his allies blasted the court-approved Mar-a-Lago search as a partisan conspiracy. The Justice Department filed charges against a Pennsylvania man who had allegedly posted threats online , including, \"I sincerely believe that if you work for the FBI, then you deserve to DIE.\" A Republican candidate for the Florida House announced he had a plan for federal agents to be shot \"on sight.\" Even the previously low-profile National Archives and Rec­ords Administration became a target .\n\nIn August, I attended a threat-assessment conference where several of the field's leaders told me they were deeply alarmed about the volatile national atmosphere. While far-left rhetoric has stirred some violent protests and threats, they said, plots and attacks fueled by Trump's incitement and MAGA extremism are by far the driving concern.\n\nForensic psychiatrist Philip Saragoza told me political extremism factors into a growing range of threat investigations. \"People are just at a fever pitch,\" he said. \"The intensity of partisan hostility in general has continued to rise.\"\n\nAfter Mar-a-Lago, Trump allies claimed that the feds were coming for the MAGA base next. If the FBI can do this to him, they inveighed on social media and Fox News, just imagine what they could do to you. Ditto with their response to new funding boosting the ranks of the dilapidated IRS. This represents a stark reversal for the GOP: Whereas President George H.W. Bush once renounced the National Rifle Association for disparaging federal agents as \"jack-booted thugs,\" Republican senators now wield such rhetoric. \"Stop Biden's shadow army of 87,000 IRS agents,\" Ted Cruz warned . Chuck Grassley insinuated that an IRS \"strike force\" could show up with assault weapons \"ready to shoot some small business person in Iowa.\"\n\nDemagoguery of this kind can be a powerful accelerant, Saragoza says. \"Most everyday people are likely to see these claims as absurd. But for some who identify with extreme partisanship, they very much see it as an existential threat.\"\n\nAs details emerged from the Mar-a-Lago investigation, Sen. Lindsey Graham conjured a specter of civil unrest. \"If there's a prosecution of Donald Trump for mishandling classified information,\" the South Carolina Republican said on Fox , \"there'll be riots in the street.\" Trump posted Graham's segment on Truth Social soon after. The next day Graham said he rejected violence-while continuing to predict \"a lot of upset people\" if Trump is charged. This also reflects the rhetorical technique modeled by the ex-president: inoculating oneself against responsibility by offering equivocal denials, claims to have been \" joking, \" or generalized statements of support for law and order. Such backpedaling never draws much attention, nor does it un-ring the bell for extremist followers.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis is mimicking Trump's playbook as he eyes a White House run. In a late-August speech, DeSantis evoked violence against a figure despised by the right: Anthony Fauci . \"I'm just sick of seeing him,\" DeSantis told a roaring crowd. \"Someone needs to grab that little elf and chuck him across the Potomac.\"\n\nBeyond merely stoking political anger, DeSantis and various Republican agitators have adopted an alarming feature of Trump's tirades: insults that appeal to visceral contempt and revulsion. Trump routinely demonized adversaries as \"sick,\" \"creepy,\" \"nasty,\" and \"disgusting.\" GOP lawmakers, including Lauren Boebert and Matt Gaetz , have followed suit. That's especially concerning-research led by psychologist David Matsumoto shows that anger combined with contempt and disgust produces a potent hatred that increases the likelihood of violence .\n\nTrump has ratcheted up the incitement in pace with his growing legal predicaments. \"Never in our Country's history has there been a time where law enforcement has been so viciously and violently involved in the life and times of politics,\" he posted on Truth Social after the Mar-a-Lago search. \"They are destroying our Country!\"\n\nHe floated baseless claims that the FBI \"planted\" evidence and he targeted the federal judge who approved the search warrant: \"Judge Bruce Reinhart should NEVER have allowed the Break-In of my home,\" he wrote, adding that Reinhart-who was already facing violent threats -was driven by \"animosity and hatred.\" Trump also shared extremist posts, including an image showing Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden, and Kamala Harris with their faces covered over by the words \"Your enemy is not in Russia.\"\n\nAt a rally in Pennsylvania on September 3, Trump escalated even further, calling the FBI and Justice Department \"vicious monsters\" and President Biden an \"enemy of the state.\" That outburst came after Biden had begun speaking more explicitly about the dangers posed by Trump. \"History tells us that blind loyalty to a single leader and a willingness to engage in political violence is fatal to democracy,\" Biden said in a primetime speech, openly rebuking Trump and \"MAGA Republicans,\" whom he framed as a minority of the GOP.\n\nBut barely any Republican leaders have called out the threat, and so long as Trump remains a political force and voters stay hunkered in partisan media silos, risk will loom for further bloodshed at the hands of extremists. Mass shooters in Pittsburgh in 2018 and El Paso, Texas, in 2019 espoused racist claims about an immigrant \"invasion\" that echoed rhetoric Trump frequently used . In the run-up to the January 6 attack, the far-right Proud Boys were emboldened by Trump's infamous directive to \"stand back and stand by\"; leaders of the group instigated street brawls in the nation's capital and played a major role in the insurrection . Recent polling suggests that some Republican voters may now see political violence as acceptable. And Trump keeps floating the possibility of pardoning and apologizing to January 6 rioters , many of whom have since pleaded guilty or been convicted of crimes that included brutal assaults on police officers.\n\nNational security expert Juliette Kayyem-who for years has warned of Trump's role as the de facto leader of a domestic terrorism movement-sees the work of the House January 6 committee as helpful. \"I am not looking for a single 'blow' to end MAGA incitement,\" she remarked recently. \"Violent movements either grow or weaken. There are significant metrics suggesting that post-January 6 efforts have taken their toll.\" She sees a telling sign of weakness in Trump's escalating rhetoric. Yet in the short term that may make him even more dangerous.\n\nIn Saragoza's view, leaders in both parties face a moral imperative to confront incitement more honestly. \"Our elected officials know by now that this is a serious problem,\" he says. He and other experts have seen how anti-violence messaging can be effective, yet few public figures are trying to change the discourse. \"More of them should be looking at the situation and be able to say, 'This has really gotten out of hand.'\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Lawmakers Spoke Up For an Indicted Chinese Mogul. Campaign Cash Followed.\n\nMother Jones illustration; NFSC; Don Emmert/AFP/Getty; Kent Nishimura/Los Angeles Times; Getty\n\nThe New Federal State of China , a conspiracy theory-promoting group launched in 2020 by Steve Bannon and exiled Chinese mogul Guo Wengui, who the Justice Department has indicted for running a massive fraud scheme, held its gala third-anniversary event in June. Among the mostly Chinese emigres at the event were some notable House Republicans.\n\nFabulist and alleged fraudster George Santos was a headliner. Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar-a 2020 election truther censured by the House in 2021 after he spoke at a white supremacist event and posted a meme in which he murdered a colleague-was also a featured speaker. Rep. Andy Ogles, a hard-right freshman from Tennessee, who like Santos was found after his election to have fibbed about his resume, spoke as well. Several other GOP congressional candidates also offered remarks. They included Burt Thakur, a former Jeopardy champion seeking a House seat in Texas. Emceeing the event was none other than Bannon, the former Trump adviser who has worked for Guo in recent years, and who was famously arrested on Guo's yacht in 2020.\n\nAll the speakers praised Guo or his organization for their purported campaign to \"take down\" the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nThese appearances seem to have paid off. After the three House members and Thakur demonstrated their support for the imprisoned mogul and his organization, Guo backers steered thousands of dollars to their campaigns. Many of those donations appear to have resulted from a coordinated effort by leaders of Guo's movement to reward lawmakers who defend him. Guo backers claim he is being prosecuted because of his vocal criticism of the Chinese Communist Party. That is, they allege the Chinese government is manipulating American courts to silence Guo.\n\nThe lawmakers and candidates at the NFSC event endorsed, or at least have tacitly entertained, that conspiracy theory.\n\nIt is perfectly legal for Guo's fans to contribute to lawmakers based on their public support for him or the politicians' opposition to the Chinese Communist Party. But these donations are notable, given the sweeping fraud case Guo faces.\n\nGuo is a reputed billionaire who fled China in 2014 ahead of criminal charges that included fraud and rape . In the US, he built a reputation as a flamboyant critic of the Chinese Communist Party and launched a series of companies and nonprofits that have pumped out right-wing conspiracy theories about Covid and the 2020 election. In late 2020, he helped fund Trump's \"stop-the-steal\" efforts.\n\nIn March, federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged Guo with stealing more than $1 billion from his own supporters through a series of investment scams. They allege he misappropriated investment money from his network to pay for homes, cars, multiple $36,000 mattresses , yacht maintenance, and even the Mahwah, New Jersey, mansion where the NFSC event was held. He has pleaded not guilty. Denied bail, he remains jailed in New York.\n\nHis organization, the New Federal State of China, sells itself as a government-in-waiting prepared to take over following what Guo and Bannon insist is the imminent collapse of the Chinese Communist Party. But federal prosecutors have suggested that this claim, and all of Guo's anti-CCP rhetoric, is a ruse he used to win over supporters he then defrauded. DOJ's indictment against Guo alleged that he exploited nonprofits underwriting the NFSC \"to amass followers who were aligned with his purported campaign against the Chinese Communist Party and who were also inclined to believe [Guo's] statements regarding investment and moneymaking opportunities.\"\n\nGuo has also been accused in lawsuits by Chinese dissidents and people with whom he worked of being an agent for the Chinese government, an allegation that he denies.\n\nAs Mother Jones and others have reported , Santos, starting in May, received a deluge of donations from apparent Guo backers totaling approximately $130,000 after he publicly defended him. Santos echoed his support during the June 4 event, saying that Guo \"is a prisoner of the CCP in the United States.\" He has repeatedly vowed to use his office to \"free\" Guo and has even introduced a bill called the \" GUO Act \"-short for \"Government Unanimous Oversight\"-as part of his effort to court Guo's adherents.\n\nThe infusion of cash following Santos' embrace of Guo came as contributions from residents of his district almost completely dried up, Santos' recent campaign filing shows. That shortage followed reporting on Santos' extensive lies about his biography and his May indictment for fraud and money laundering. He pleaded not guilty. But Santos' embrace of Guo has helped earn him a new constituency far outside the boundaries of his Long Island district. In reviewing campaign finance reports, Guo fans now appear to be the main source of funding for Santos' uphill reelection effort.\n\nThose donations stem from what appears to be an organized effort by Guos' followers to show that backing their cause will result in campaign cash.\n\nSenior members of Guo's network distributed a Google form to thousands of Guo supporters in which they could register donations to Santos with the higher-ups in the network, Mother Jones found . \"This form is for comrades who have donated to Santos to register their donation information,\" the document says, in Chinese. Former Guo backers said his organization uses similar forms to allow members to log various activities they carry out to support Guo.\n\nScreenshots of messages posted by users on a private Discord group used by Guo backers in Oxford in the United Kingdom, which Mother Jones obtained from a person with access to the server, also suggest that the group urged donations to Santos as a public show of support. \"He [Santos] has stood with the New Federal State of China,\" a user wrote, in a message that has been translated from Chinese. \"We cannot let him down. This will also encourage other people like him to stand by us. His vote is crucial to the small majority of the Republican Party.\" In a follow-up message, the user wrote that only US citizens and green card holders could legally contribute.\n\nThese posts reference a solicitation Santos made on May 10. \"I asked questions about #MilesGuo & the DOJ indicts me 5 days later!\" Santos wrote on Gettr, a social media site that prosecutors have said Guo controls. \"The fight is real & I'm OVER the target, I need your support to keep me fighting for freedom.\"\n\nReps. Gosar and Ogles appeared at the NFSC event about a month after Santos took up Guo's cause, and their remarks were comparatively restrained, mostly generic compliments and denunciations of supposed CCP influence. Ogles told attendees: \"For those that fight for freedom and liberty around the world...your cause is my cause.\" Gosar accused China of using TikTok to promote \"hedonism\" and \"mindless dancing.\"\n\nRep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) after concluding his June 4 remarks at the New Federal State of China's third-anniversary event.\n\nNFSCTV/Gettr\n\nCampaign finance filings for both lawmakers show that each received roughly $20,000 from outside their respective districts around the time of the June 4 event. These donations could not all be directly linked to Guo backers. But Mother Jones identified multiple contributors to each Republican who are followers of both Guo and the New Federal State of China.\n\nOne was Li Rong Pang of Kissimmee, Florida. In a phone interview, Pang, described herself as a Guo backer and said she gave $3,300, the maximum allowed, to Gosar on June 4-although she did not recall his name-because he appeared at the NFSC event and embraced the group's cause. \"If they [say] 'take down the CCP, \" Pang said, \"I will support all the Congress.\" There is no record that Pang, who described herself as retired, has previously donated to any federal candidate.\n\nGosar collected another $3,300 from Yuliang Yan, a Seattle-area mortgage broker on June 4. Pictures from the June 4 NFSC event show a man who appears to be Yan, based on an online photo of him, in the crowd. Yan did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nRep. Ogles also received generous contributions from Guo Ming-not related to Guo Wengui-who has been identified in live-streamed NFSC online programs as a technical producer. He's from Cupertino, California, and leads a group of NFSC supporters based in San Francisco, according to two people who previously worked for Guo. Guo Ming, who donated $3,300 to Ogles in early June, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nJason Gao and a woman who shares his address in Chino, California, also maxed out to Ogles. Gao is active in the pro-Guo group in San Francisco, according to a source formerly involved in Guo's organization. Gao has also appeared in pictures of Guo backers posted online. Reached by phone, Gao declined to comment.\n\nRep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) speaking at the June 4 NFSC event.\n\nNFSCTV/Gettr\n\nThakur, the congressional candidate from Texas, baselessly asserted during the NFSC event that th e CCP \"worked with members of our own government to imprison Miles Guo. \" Thakur on June 9 received a $1,000 donation from Chong Zhang. Zhang listed a home address hours away in a different Texas district. She said her employer is OSC Orbit Service Company-a Connecticut-based firm that provides customer service for multiple Guo-linked companies including Gettr and G|Clubs, which DOJ alleged was one of several mostly fraudulent ventures that Guo used to mislead investors. Zhang did not respond to inquiries from Mother Jones .\n\nCampaign offices for Ogles and Thakur did not respond to questions about their receipt of donations from Guo backers. Santos has not replied to repeated queries about his links to Guo.\n\nA Gosar campaign spokesperson said: \"Mr. Guo has been a vocal opponent of the Communist regime in China and a supporter of those in the US who share his concerns about the CCP.  Congressman Gosar has been speaking out about the risks of dependence on China for critical minerals, food, and manufactured goods for some time. Mr. Guo's prosecution in the US is presumptively political and abusive. The DOJ has lost any credibility at this point. Mr. Guo is presumptively innocent under our Constitution.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Kevin McCarthy Is Cutting Deals With the Big Lie's Worst Offenders\n\nKevin McCarthy won support Friday from Rep. Ralph Norman, who on Jan. 17, 2021, urged Trump to invoke \"Marshall Law.\" Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nHouse Republicans are celebrating the anniversary of the January 6 attack by making it clear that they are not, in actual practice, against it.\n\nWould-be House Speaker Kevin McCarthy spent Friday morning and preceding days hurling concessions at some of the same far-right members of Congress who helped Donald Trump incite the riot and tried to overturn a democratic election. After a dozen ballots, McCarthy's genuflecting finally won him support from House Freedom Caucus chair Scott Perry (R-Pa.). Perry, as my colleague David Corn points out , is known for his central role in a scheme to have the Justice Department falsely claim to have found evidence supporting Trump's election fraud lies. That effort is the subject of an especially robust part of the sprawling DOJ criminal investigation that includes FBI agents searching Perry's phone. The scandal does not seem to have affected Perry's position as a power broker in the House GOP. Exactly what concessions McCarthy offered to win over Perry and his allies remains to be detailed. But an agreement by the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC linked to McCarthy, to refrain from opposing hard-right candidates in open GOP primaries may have smoothed the path to Perry's reversal.\n\nMcCarthy on Friday also won over Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), who-along with Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), former Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) and Stop the Steal maestro Ali Alexander-\" schemed up ,\" in Alexander's words, a plan to put \"maximum pressure on Congress while they were voting\" on certifications of the presidential election on January 6. McCarthy had already agreed to restore to Gosar committee seats he lost in 2021 after participating in a white nationalist conference and posting an animated video that showed him killing Democratic Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez. McCarthy likewise had vowed to restore the committee postings of QAnon-friendly Rep. Majorie Taylor Greene. Greene had previously been booted from her committees over outlandish rhetoric, like saying Jewish space lasers cause wildfires. Unlike Perry and Gosar, Greene has been a vocal McCarthy backer since the midterm elections.\n\nAnother holdout who joined McCarthy's camp Friday was Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.). Following the January 6 attack, Norman urged Trump to impose \"Marshall law\" to stop Joe Biden from taking office. Also supporting McCarthy on all the votes this week: Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who is expected to become House Judiciary Committee chairman. Jordan, who received 20 votes for speaker from McCarthy foes on Tuesday, helped Trump plot his self-coup attempt and has never explained phone calls he exchanged with Trump on January 6.\n\nMcCarthy's litany of concessions to his party's far-right includes a vow to gut the House Ethics Committee. Last month, the House January 6 committee asked the Ethics Committee to investigate Jordan, Perry, Biggs, and McCarthy himself for refusing to comply with subpoenas from the panel.\n\nRegardless of their stance on McCarthy, the GOP members who sought to overturn the 2020 election remain largely unrepentant. Few have acknowledged that Trump attempted a coup, or that supporting his effort was a mistake. They face little pressure to do so. The coercion runs the other way.\n\nMcCarthy himself joined in voting to throw out the Electoral College results, even after the insurrection. He said , days after the attack, that Trump \"bears responsibility for [the] attack on Congress by mob rioters.\" But he quickly retreated from that clarity to appease his party's right flank. He similarly backed the idea of a bipartisan commission to investigate January 6, but he then reversed course and worked to undermine the committee that then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi eventually established. He helped oust former Rep. Liz Cheney from GOP leadership-and eventually from the House itself-as retribution for her insistence on holding Trump accountable for January 6.\n\nThe Republican meltdown this week follows years of GOP dysfunction caused by relying on the votes of radical members opposed to governing. But the party's failure to coherently oppose January 6 and Trump's coup attempt is no a mere continuation of a trend. It is a new nadir.\n\nThe fact that this failure has continued into 2023 is especially notable because it is clearly against Republicans' collective self-interest. GOP devotion to the Big Lie is one reason the Republican majority is so narrow. And the narrowness of that majority is, in turn, the reason why the party's most vocal Big Lie proponents have been able to hold their party leadership hostage this week. The insurrectionist wing is exploiting a problem it helped cause. McCarthy probably knows this better than anyone, but he is appeasing them anyway.\n\nMcCarthy clearly calculated that his personal ambition required him to cleave to Trump, despite the ex-president's recent call for the \"termination\" of constitutional provisions preventing him from being illegally re-installed as president. This is the prevailing position of members of the House GOP caucus. The majority surely know that the party has been hurt politically by its loyalty to Trump and the Big Lie lost-causers. But many of their districts and short-term interests give them cause to avoid getting out ahead of any effort to quit the crazies. They can score points by opposing it. Republicans have a world-historic collective action problem.\n\nThat requires leadership to overcome-leadership they aren't getting.\n\nOn Friday morning, as House members gathered to mark the two-year anniversary of January 6, only one GOP member, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (Pa.), was there. The rest were on a conference call regarding the speaker fight. Read into that what you will. But the symbolism matters less than actual repudiation. Supporting American democracy means choosing to back its rules when you lose. Republicans, two years after January 6, remain beholden to the Big Lie and its tellers. Priorities are revealed in actions. By such standards, House Republicans are still siding with the people who stormed the Capitol and with the former president who incited them. The call is coming from inside the House.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) condemning the congressman in scathing terms to endorse Gosar's Democratic challenger, Dr. David Brill.\n\nThe siblings-Grace, David, Jennifer, Joan, Tim, and Gaston-speak candidly about the heartbreaking task of speaking out against their brother and his positions on a range of issues including healthcare, immigration, and the economy.\n\nBut with their decisions made, don't expect the Gosar family to mince words either.\n\n\"Paul's absolutely not working for his district,\" David Gosar says in one of the videos. \"I think my brother has traded a lot of the values we had at our kitchen table,\" Joan Gosar says in another. Tim Gosar describes the election as \"intervention time\" to vote his brother out of office.\n\nThe ads conclude with each of the Gosar siblings stating their full names and proclaiming their official support for Brill's bid to unseat their brother. Together, the forceful denunciations created what is being widely called one of the most scathing campaign ads in recent memory.\n\nIn a series of tweets Saturday, the congressman dismissed his six siblings as \"disgruntled Hillary supporters\" related only by blood. \"Stalin would be proud,\" he claimed.\n\nNot one of my siblings lives in Arizona and my opponent's policies are out of sync with what Arizona wants and the country needs.

      "text": "Election Deniers Just Scored a Major Win in Arizona's Biggest County\n\nMother Jones; Michael Brochstein/Zuma; Unsplash\n\nEarlier this month, Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, a Republican who oversees mail-in voting, voter registration, and property records in America's fourth-largest county, reached out to Elon Musk with an invitation.\n\n\"Can I please give you a tour of our election facility and mail voting process,\" he wrote on Musk's social-media platform, X, after the red-pilled billionaire declared that \"electronic voting machines\" and \"anything mailed in\" were \"too risky\" to use in elections.\n\n\"You can go into all the rooms,\" Richer continued. \"You can examine all the equipment. You can ask any question you want. We'd love to show you the security steps already in place, which I think are very sound.\"\n\nFor three-and-a-half years, Richer has been asking skeptical Republicans just to hear him out about how elections really work in the most closely contested county in the nation's most closely contested state. First elected in 2020 amid right-wing fears about George Soros, Richer, a Federalist Society lawyer, emerged as one of the nation's most outspoken voices against the myth of stolen outcomes. He held the line against election deniers such as Kari Lake (who Richer is currently suing for defamation) while attempting to make the election process as transparent as possible. Richer opened the doors to the county's Tabulation and Election Center for more than 150 tours, turned the security cameras on 24/7 for people to watch at home, and tirelessly fielded questions on Musk's platform-all while facing a stream of violent threats and criticism.\n\nBut it turned out that good cheer and transparency could only accomplish so much. Musk, for one, did not take Richer up on the offer. And on Tuesday, Richer finally ran out of time to change his fellow Republicans' minds: He lost his primary to state Rep. Justin Heap, a member of legislature's Freedom Caucus, who was backed by many of the state's most prominent election deniers. The single-digit margin only tells a part of the story; with another Richer critic running a strong third, just 36 percent of Republican voters backed the incumbent.\n\nHeap managed to never say whether he thought the 2020 or 2022 elections were stolen during his campaign. But he didn't really have to. To understand what he represented and why he was running, you only had to look at the endorsements he racked up from many of the biggest names in what Richer has called Arizona's \"cottage industry\" of election denial.\n\nChief among those backers was Lake, who ran for governor in 2022 while calling for her Democratic opponent to be imprisoned for the 2020 presidential election to be \"decertified,\" and is still- still! -attempting to get a court to declare her the winner of a race she lost by 17,000 votes. Lake-who in her memoir described a lengthy dream sequence she had about being kidnapped by Richer, taken to the desert, and nearly murdered-is now the Republican nominee for US Senate.\n\nAnother prominent supporter was Tyler Bowyer, the chief operating officer for Turning Point Action, who was indicted in April for his role in the 2020 fake elector scheme. Heap had the support of Arizona Reps. Paul Gosar (who coordinated with \"Stop the Steal\" leaders on January 6th), and Andy Biggs (who tried to round up support for the state's fake electors in the run-up to the Electoral College certification). As the Arizona Mirror reported in April, one of the people who nudged Heap into running was his colleague in the statehouse, state Rep. Jake Hoffman-another fake elector.\n\nThe vitriol Richer faced from current party leaders was intense. Earlier this year, Shelby Busch, the vice chair of the Maricopa County Republican party told an audience that if it was up to her, she \" would lynch \" Richer. Busch, who later said that she was joking, went on to lead the state party's delegation to the Republican National Convention.\n\nBecause of the way elections are run in the county, a new recorder can't just rewrite the rules on his own terms. The Board of Supervisors is responsible for tabulation and election-day voting, for instance, and the state's vote-by-mail system and use of electronic voting machines are set by statute. But notably, Heap has voted to get rid of both of those things, while also voting to mandate hand-counts. (At the same time, Heap is running to be Recorder on the promise of speeding up the counting of votes, which a hand count is not likely to accomplish.)\n\nWith support from independents and hard-earned respect from some Democrats, Richer was in a decent position to win a second term if he managed to survive the primary. One Indivisible activist from Scottsdale, who took an election-facility tour with Richer, told me that Richer was going to be the first Republican she ever voted for. But Heap's victory is far from guaranteed in a county where Democrats have won a succession of key races by appealing to independents and moderate Republicans. On Tuesday, Democrats nominated Tim Stringham, an Army and Navy veteran who previously served as a JAG attorney.\n\nWhen we spoke in June, Stringham told me that he had entered the race reluctantly, after being nudged by the county Democratic party. But he cited Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 election as a pivotal moment in his decision to become more involved in politics.\n\n\"And as a veteran, somebody who's gone 10,000 miles and risked being blown up to defend democracy, you start feeling a little bit silly. My wife is back in Arizona, what the hell am I doing?\"\n\n\"Watching on TV, and being like, holy cow, the President of the United States is really trying to overthrow the republic here,\" Stringham said. \"And I always tell people that it's like, you know, if there's just a riot, there's just a riot, those things happen. But somebody actually handed fake electoral votes to Mike Pence and said we want you to read these votes. They no-shit tried to overthrow the Constitution. And as a veteran, somebody who's gone 10,000 miles and risked being blown up to defend democracy, you start feeling a little bit silly.\"\n\n\"'My wife is back in Arizona, what the hell am I doing?,'\" he said, recalling his thought process at the time. \"'I'm clearly not in the right place to actually protect American democracy.'\"\n\nStringham did not believe there was a \"huge philosophical difference\" between he and Richer on how the recorder's office was run, but he was adamant about wanting to preserve the availability of ballot drop-boxes and protect vote-by-mail from Republican legislators' attempts to end it.\n\nThe incumbent's defeat is a setback for election officials who have faced threats and tried to clarify the process amid a deluge of misinformation. Scores of election workers across the country, and particularly in Arizona, are leaving their jobs in part due to the added strain of dealing with sometimes-armed conspiracy theorists and endless lawsuits. In Maricopa, Republican county supervisor Bill Gates, who joined Richer in defending the election process in 2022, chose not to run for re-election this year and has talked publicly about suffering from PTSD. Another Republican supervisor who has been a target of election deniers, Jack Sellers, lost his primary on Tuesday too. It's tough to see how things might have played out differently in recent years if the people screaming about stopping the steal also had allies in some of the most important election administration positions in the land. But it probably wouldn't have been great.\n\nRicher's loss won't, at least, have much of an effect on how the 2024 election is conducted. The recorder's term won't end until January-meaning that the lame-duck Republican will still be around to do one last job this November.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "House Speaker Fight Shows Election Deniers Who Tried to Overthrow Democracy Still Control GOP\n\nScott Perry (R-Pa.) confers with  Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during Donald Trump's first impeachment. Susan Walsh/AP\n\nOn the first day of the new Congress, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) delivered one of the nominating speeches for Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who was seeking the House speakership. Jordan bemoaned a \"government that has been weaponized\" against the American people and called for greater accountability. The next day, during a second round of failed votes for McCarthy, Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.), the leader of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, voiced a similar sentiment but in opposing McCarthy: \"Washington is broken... We have an administration that has contempt for the American people.\" Though the two men were on different sides in this battle royal, they were united in hypocrisy, for each of these decriers of abusive power had been collaborators in Donald Trump's public crusade to promote the lies about the 2020 election that led to the January 6 insurrectionist attack on the Capitol and in Trump's devious plotting to overturn the election and upend American democracy.\n\nTheir roles in the House GOP's crapshow illustrated a profound fact largely overlooked in this hullabaloo: The political chaos that brought the House of Representatives to a standstill was being perpetuated by a party that two years earlier had tried to sabotage the republic and had championed falsehoods and conspiracy theories that led to seditious violence in the very chamber where the speakership fight was now occurring. Of the 222 Republicans currently in the House GOP caucus, 119 had on January 6, 2021 , after the Trump-incited riot, affirmed the false charge of a stolen election by voting to block certification of Joe Biden's victory. This group included most of the anti-McCarthy bloc, among them Reps. Andy Biggs, Paul Gosar, Lauren Boebert, Matt Gaetz, and Ralph Norman, who in January 2021 texted then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows that Trump should consider \"Marshall Law\" to remain in office. And this group included McCarthy.\n\nThe GOP civil war in the House was being fought over whether to elevate an election denier who had helped spread the Big Lie that spurred violence to a position that is second in the line of presidential succession. Yet McCarthy's participation in that assault on democracy was not an issue. For Republicans, it was a prerequisite.\n\nThough most Republicans elected to the new Congress share culpability for January 6 and the failed effort to blow up the 2020 election, Perry and Jordan stand out for their significant participation in Trump's anti-constitutional and arguably criminal caper.\n\nThe House January 6 committee's report details Perry as a key conspirator in one of Trump's plots to reverse the election. After the 2020 election was called, Perry was a prominent cheerleader of Trump's fraudulent claim the election had been stolen from him. He was one of 27 Republican House members who signed a letter requesting that Trump \"direct Attorney General Barr to appoint a Special Counsel to investigate irregularities in the 2020 election.\" He attended a December 21 Oval Office meeting with at least 10 other congressional Republicans to discuss a strategy for objecting to the electoral college votes on January 6. And with 125 other House Republicans, he supported Texas' lawsuit that called for throwing out the votes of Pennsylvania and three other states.\n\nBut Perry outdid other GOP election deniers with his behind-the-scenes scheming to corrupt the Justice Department.\n\nIn late December 2020, after Barr resigned (having told Trump privately and stated publicly there was no evidence of any significant electoral fraud), Trump relentlessly leaned on the Justice Department-mainly, Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and his deputy, Richard Donoghue-to affirm his baseless assertion that the election had been rigged. They resisted and repeatedly told Trump the allegations of fraud were untrue. Trump was not getting what he wanted from the department.\n\nThis is where Perry came in. He found a Justice Department official named Jeffrey Clark who was running the Environment and Natural Resources Division. Clark had nothing to do with investigating the allegations of election fraud, but he was willing to echo and legitimize Trump's false charges. Perry introduced Clark to Trump, arranging a meeting between the two in the Oval Office on December 22. As the January 6 committee noted, \"Clark's contact with President Trump violated both Justice Department and White House policies designed to prevent political pressure on the Department.\"\n\nPerry also sent numerous text messages to Meadows urging that Clark be promoted within the department, presumably to a position in which he could compel the Justice Department to assist Trump's bid to retain power. In one message, Perry referred to the upcoming certification of the electoral vote and declared, \"11 days to 1/6... We gotta get going!\"\n\nThough Rosen and Donoghue ordered Clark to have no further contact with Trump, Clark continued to meet with Trump and Perry. Perry also directly confronted the Justice Department about its refusal to back up Trump's false allegations. He called Donoghue on December 27 and assailed the FBI and the department for not finding evidence of election fraud. He added that \"Clark would do something about this.\"\n\nThat night, Perry emailed Donoghue material alleging that election authorities in Pennsylvania had counted 200,000 or so more votes than had been cast-a claim that he and Trump raised publicly. No such thing had happened. Perry was spreading disinformation in an attempt to disenfranchise the voters of his own state.\n\nMeanwhile, Clark-Perry's man at the Justice Department-was pushing an underhanded plan to keep Trump in power. This included proposing to send a letter to the state legislature of Georgia-and those of other swing states-that falsely declared that the Justice Department had \"identified significant concerns that may have impacted the outcome of the election in multiple States, including the State of Georgia.\" The letter recommended that the state legislature call a special session to evaluate potential election fraud. The draft of this letter referred to the fake electors that Trump and his campaign had organized.\n\nWhen Rosen and Donoghue refused to sign this letter, Trump moved to boot Rosen and replace him with Clark. At a combative Oval Office meeting on January 3, Rosen, Donoghue, White House counsel Pat Cipollone and others strenuously opposed Clark's appointment and told Trump it would lead to massive resignations at the department. Only then did Trump retreat on appointing Clark acting attorney general. This attempt to enlist the Justice Department for a coup was over.\n\nThe Trump-Clark scheme, in which Perry was a major plotter, was cited by the House January 6 committee in its final report as one basis for its criminal referral of Trump and others. And apparently Perry had some concerns for his own legal safety. According to the committee, after January 6, he reached out to White House staff and asked to receive a presidential pardon. (He did not receive one.)\n\nIn August, the FBI seized Perry's cell phone, presumably as part of its investigation of the Trump-Clark operation. Perry claimed he was told he was not the subject of an investigation. The January 6 committee subpoenaed Perry, but he refused to show up for a deposition, and the committee subsequently referred him to the House Ethics Committee for sanction for failing to comply with the subpoena.\n\nAs for Jim Jordan, the January 6 committee declared he was \"a significant player in President Trump's efforts.\" It noted:\n\nHe participated in numerous post-election meetings in which senior White House officials, Rudolph Giuliani, and others, discussed strategies for challenging the election, chief among them claims that the election had been tainted by fraud. On January 2, 2021, Representative Jordan led a conference call in which he, President Trump, and other Members of Congress discussed strategies for delaying the January 6th joint session. During that call, the group also discussed issuing social media posts encouraging President Trump's supporters to \"march to the Capitol\" on the 6th.\n\nThe committee's report points out that Jordan was in touch with Meadows and Trump in the days before the January 6 riot. On January 5, he texted Meadows that Vice President Mike Pence should \"call out all the electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all.\" That is, Jordan was urging an unconstitutional action to achieve a Trump power-grab that would thwart the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nOn January 6, Jordan spoke with Trump at least twice, and, according to the committee, \"he has provided inconsistent public statements about how many times they spoke and what they discussed.\" He also spoke to Rudy Giuliani at least twice in the hours after the riot, as Giuliani continued to encourage members of Congress to block the certification of the election. In the following days, the committee noted, Jordan discussed with White House staffers the prospect of presidential pardons for members of Congress.\n\nLike Perry, Jordan was subpoenaed by the January 6 committee and refused to cooperate, earning a referral to the House Ethics Committee-as did McCarthy. The committee wanted information from McCarthy regarding his conversations with Trump and Pence on and about January 6. He, too, would not cooperate.\n\nAs the McCarthy drama has played out, critical participants have been election deniers who not long ago sought to undermine democracy and whose actions led to the domestic terrorism of January 6. McCarthy's foes, his defenders, and McCarthy himself all were part of the efforts to subvert the Constitution following Biden's victory. Moreover, whatever happens with McCarthy, these enemies of democracy will end up with important positions in the House. Jordan is expected to become chair of the Judiciary Committee. Perry will likely remain chair of the House Freedom Caucus, which will continue as a band of extremists and plague whichever Republican becomes speaker. This absurd speakership fight is a reminder that Republicans who tried to annihilate the constitutional order and who bolstered conspiracy theories and lies that ignited violence have attained power and influence.

Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., about Israel being a \" racist state ,\" a characterization she made while trying to quiet a group holding Palestinian flags at a conference for the progressive Netroots Nation. Characteristic of the way politicians often conflate criticism of Israel - the country - with broad criticism of Jews, Democrats and Republicans alike condemned Jayapal's statement as antisemitic.\n\nThe outrage was dubious at best given that Israel's government \"has been cutting away at the fundamental rights of the Palestinians who live within territory controlled by Israel\" for years, writer David Rothkopf told Joy on Monday's episode of \"The ReidOut.\"\n\nSounds pretty racist to me. And to many human rights activists , too.\n\nNonetheless, Jayapal issued a statement to \"clarify\" her remarks after facing backlash. And the House overwhelmingly passed its resolution condemning antisemitism and xenophobia. All good, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nRep. Paul Gosar has entered the chat.\n\nWho could have guessed that the Arizona Republican, one of America's most bigoted lawmakers, would expose the House resolution as a sham?\n\nI'm going to say everyone.\n\nMedia Matters reported Monday that Gosar had - yet again - promoted a website known for spreading antisemitism, such as Hitler praise and Holocaust denial.\n\nFrom the media watchdog's report :\n\nRep. Paul Gosar yesterday used his House.gov newsletter to promote USSA News, a fringe site that has posted content calling the Holocaust 'the Holohoax' and telling readers to 'stand up for Hitler.' Gosar's promotion of the antisemitic outlet comes just months after he sent followers to a different site that has also denied the Holocaust and praised Adolf Hitler.\n\nGosar was embroiled in a nearly identical controversy in April after using his weekly House.gov newsletter to provide a link to a different antisemitic website.\n\nAs the Arizona Mirror noted back then , it wasn ' t the first time Gosar had engaged with antisemitism:\n\nIn 2021, Gosar promoted the work of known white nationalist Vincent James Foxx, who became the unofficial propagandist for a neo-Nazi fight club. Gosar spoke at the same white nationalist conference as Foxx a few years earlier, alongside Holocaust-denier and antisemite Nick Fuentes, the first sitting politician to do so.\n\nA month later, Talking Points Memo reported that Gosar has even employed a staffer with close ties to Fuentes.\n\nMedia Matters found several recent examples of USSA News pieces defending Hitler and denying the Holocaust. In Sunday's newsletter in which he linked to a USSA News story , Gosar even included a s tatement he issued announcing his support for last week's antisemitism resolution - and denouncing Jayapal.\n\n\"There is zero room in our society for these vile, hateful and bigoted comments in the Halls of Congress,\" the newsletter reads.\n\nKeep in mind, Gosar also voted to expel Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., from the House Foreign Affairs Committee over purported antisemitism .\n\nConsider the upside-down world we're now experiencing. A woman of color criticizes a demonstrably racist Israeli government, and a there's a wave of bipartisan backlash.\n\nA bigoted white dude repeatedly promotes platforms whose writers celebrate Hitler and deny the Holocaust, but he gets to condemn her for antisemitism.\n\nI'd say \"Only in America,\" but, you know, we're not the only racist state in the world .\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger.

      "text": "GOP Reps. Gosar and Biggs reportedly receive subpoenas in Arizona\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nBy Steve Benen\n\nThe criminal cases related to Donald Trump's post-defeat plots understandably receive a lot of attention, but it's worth remembering that there are still some ongoing related investigations unfolding at the state level.\n\nIn Michigan, for example, state Attorney General Dana Nessel filed charges against a group of fake electors from the 2020 election last summer. Months later, there were related developments in Nevada . Around the same time, Kris Mayes, Arizona's Democratic state attorney general, told CNN that her office was still overseeing a \"robust\" investigation related to related alleged crimes.\n\nEvidently, she wasn't kidding. Politico reported :\n\nArizona investigators probing Republicans' efforts to overturn the state's 2020 election results have subpoenaed two members of Congress who were among Donald Trump's closest Capitol Hill allies in the scheme. The subpoenas to Reps. Andy Biggs and Paul Gosar, which have not previously been reported, ordered the two Arizona Republicans to testify before a grand jury.\n\nAccording to the reporting , which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, there's nothing to suggest state prosecutors are weighing possible charges against either of the far-right congressmen, though the subpoenas suggest that Mayes \"has cast a far wider net in her probe than previously understood.\"\n\nIt will also be of interest to see how Biggs and Gosar respond to the subpoenas. When the bipartisan House select committee investigating Jan. 6 subpoenaed Biggs nearly two years ago , the GOP lawmaker ignored the summons . Blowing off the state attorney general's office would create a new set of difficulties for the congressman.\n\nAs for why, exactly, Mayes and her office would be interested in these specific House members, there can be little doubt that the two have insights that could shed light on the broader scandal.\n\nFor example, the Jan. 6 committee concluded that Biggs attended an infamous White House strategy session on Dec. 21, 2020, where Donald Trump and his allies discussed the plot to overturn the then-president's election defeat.\n\nWhat's more, as Politico's report added , \"According to text messages obtained by the Jan. 6 committee, Biggs quickly contacted Trump's White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, after Election Day 2020 to push for state legislatures to overrule the results in multiple states Biden won. Biggs also told Meadows that Trump should not concede the election and reportedly worked with other Arizona Republicans to advance the fake elector effort.\"\n\nAs for Gosar, the details are just as rich. The highly controversial Arizonan, who has described President Joe Biden as a \" fraudulent usurper \" and praised Jan. 6 rioters as \" peaceful patriots ,\" at one point claimed to have a secret CIA source who told him about hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes, pointing to an intelligence office that didn't appear to exist .\n\nWhat's more, The New York Times reported in 2021 on the \"band of loyalists\" who worked closely with Trump in the aftermath of his defeat, taking on \"an outsize role in pressuring the Justice Department, amplifying conspiracy theories and flooding the courts in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, Gosar was a member of this inner circle, and the article noted that he played a direct role in lobbying then-Gov. Doug Ducey, pressing him to investigate voting equipment made by Dominion Voting Systems.\n\nIs it any wonder why investigators examining post-election efforts in Arizona want to hear from the congressmen?\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor. He's also the bestselling author of \"Ministry of Truth: Democracy, Reality, and the Republicans' War on the Recent Past.\"\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Paul Gosar has found himself at the center of a controversy involving white nationalists again.\n\nLast week, the far-right Republican promoted on Instagram his upcoming appearance as a \"featured guest\" at an event hosted by the white nationalist American Populist Union in Tempe, Arizona. The scheduled date, April 20, is often celebrated by white nationalists and neo-Nazis because it's Hitler's birthday.\n\nThe Arizona Mirror was the first to report on Gosar's scheduled appearance. Hours after the article was published, a Gosar campaign consultant said Gosar would not be attending the event and was instead planning to participate in a \"farm tour\" that day. The consultant said the APU had never contacted Gosar or his campaign.\n\nOf course, that defies logic considering Gosar advertised the speech on his own Instagram account .\n\nIf you know Gosar at all, you most likely know this is unsurprising for him. He has a history of openly associating with white nationalist groups and dismissing those ties with implausible excuses. In February, he made an appearance via video at another white nationalist event - the America First Political Action Conference - organized by prominent white nationalist Nick Fuentes.\n\n(Followers of Fuentes, who call themselves \"groypers,\" are closely aligned with the American Populist Union .)\n\nAs my colleague Steve Benen reported for the Maddowblog on Monday, Gosar hadn't commented on his appearance at the February white nationalist event until late last week, offering the absurd excuse that his staff was to blame for sending his video address to the wrong group.\n\nWhoops! Don't you hate it when you accidentally send messages to white nationalist groups that perfectly align with their viewpoints, and are perfectly timed to be shown at their signature events?\n\nHis excuses for palling around with white nationalists are all the more unbelievable when you consider Gosar has a history of spreading extremist views. He attended the \"Stop the Steal\" rally that preceded the Jan. 6 attack, where he shared a threatening tweet demanding Joe Biden concede the 2020 election.\n\nMonths later, he posted a video depicting a cartoon version of himself attacking Biden and Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Gosar was censured by the Democrat-led House for sharing that video, but he's avoided punishment from GOP leadership over his appearances alongside white nationalists - effectively guaranteeing that his extremist antics won't subside.\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger.

In the abstract, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene seemed like the sort of member who'd be among his opponents. The Georgia Republican is, after all, among the most radical extremists to serve on Capitol Hill in recent memory.\n\nBut as the fight dragged on, McCarthy enjoyed Greene's steadfast support. The right-wing Georgian was, by all accounts, among the speaker's most ardent champions.\n\nThis was not the result of a longstanding alliance between the two GOP lawmakers. On the contrary, it was a marriage of convenience: McCarthy needed Greene's backing to advance his ambitions, and Greene needed McCarthy's support to advance her ambitions.\n\nThe speaker got his gavel. Yesterday, as NBC News reported , Greene received the reward.\n\nHouse Republicans have reinstated far-right Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Paul Gosar of Arizona on committees again after Democrats stripped them of that privilege in 2021, multiple GOP sources said. The GOP Steering Committee, which doles out committee gavels and seats, voted to give Greene and Gosar spots on the Oversight and Accountability Committee, which plans to launch numerous investigations into President Joe Biden and his administration.\n\nThe slot on the House Oversight Committee wasn't the congresswoman's only prize: Republicans also handed Greene a seat on the powerful Homeland Security Committee, where the radical member will, among other things, deal with domestic security threats.\n\nNone of this comes as too big of a surprise. A year before the midterm elections, McCarthy insisted that if voters put the GOP in the majority, he'd make sure that members like Greene were rewarded. The Georgian boasted at the time that she'd \"had conversations\" and received \"guarantees\" about her future.\n\nBut the fact that this was predictable doesn't make it any easier to defend.\n\nCircling back to our earlier coverage , just a month into her congressional career, an avalanche of damaging revelations come to the fore: In late January, the public learned of Greene's record of dismissing 9/11 and school massacres as hoaxes. And harassing at least one survivor of a school shooting. And expressing support for the QAnon delusion. And targeting religious minorities. And peddling bizarre claims about fire-causing space lasers.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, in 2018 and 2019, the Georgia Republican expressed support for violence against Democratic elected officials. This included an instance in which she liked a social-media comment about removing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi from office by way of \"a bullet to the head.\"\n\nThe revelations were so jarring that McCarthy - the minority leader at the time - reportedly proposed removing the extremist from one of her committee assignments . For Democrats, this wasn't nearly good enough: They voted to remove Greene from both.\n\nIt was not an entirely partisan vote: When Democrats stripped her of her committee assignments, 11 House Republicans voted with the majority.\n\nThe congresswoman could've taken the opportunity to improve her credibility and stature. Instead, a year later, Greene spoke at a white nationalist event - a move McCarthy soon after condemned as \" appalling \" and \" unacceptable .\"\n\nEleven months later, House Republicans thought it'd be a good idea to put Greene on the Homeland Security Committee.\n\nAs for Gosar, the right-wing Arizonan was stripped of his committee assignments after he released an animated video that depicted him killing one of his Democratic colleagues and attacking President Joe Biden. When Democrats acted against the congressman, two Republicans - Wyoming's Liz Cheney and Illinois' Adam Kinzinger - voted with the Democratic majority. (Cheney later lost in a GOP primary, while Kinzinger didn't seek re-election.)\n\nYesterday, Gosar, whose controversial record also includes appearances at a white nationalist event, learned that he'll serve on both the House Oversight Committee and the Natural Resources Committee, giving him renewed relevance and influence, too.\n\nThis may not have been what voters had in mind last fall, but it's the result of electing a new GOP majority.\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

NBC News reported :\n\nThe House on Wednesday voted to censure Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., after he posted an animated video that depicted him killing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and attacking President Joe Biden.\n\nThe final tally was The House voted 223 to 207.\n\nFor those who may need a refresher , it was 10 days ago when Gosar thought it'd be a good idea to release a new online video. In the edited anime clip, the Arizonan is depicted as a character who kills Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacks President Joe Biden.\n\nTwitter added a warning label to the Republican's tweet, describing it as \"hateful content.\" The congressman's office acknowledged that it was responsible for the creation of the video, though Gosar's office took it down two days after the clip created a national controversy. The congressman did not, however, issue anything resembling contrition or an apology.\n\nAnd so, the controversy continued.\n\nThere was considerable interest in whether Republicans would vote for today's censure resolution, just as most Democrats voted against Charlie Rangel a decade ago. That's not what happened: The GOP minority, after ignoring the controversy last week, and presenting a nonsensical defense this week, was nearly unanimous in its opposition to the censure resolution.\n\nThe exceptions were Wyoming's Liz Cheney and Illinois' Adam Kinzinger, both of whom voted with the Democratic majority. (Republican Rep. David Joyce of Ohio voted \"present.\")\n\nThe practical implications of the censure are rather limited: As we've discussed , these resolutions are about a formal expression of disapproval. The censure doesn't do anything specific, though it adds a permanent scar to Gosar's record.\n\nThe fact that the resolution also stripped the far-right lawmaker of his committee assignments, however, is going to have a bigger impact. Gosar's presence on Capitol Hill is poised to become largely meaningless: He'll still be able to vote on legislation on the floor, and he'll presumably still be involved with constituent services, but without committee assignments, the congressman's day-to-day responsibilities as a federal legislator have been dramatically curtailed.\n\nNote, when House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy stripped then-Rep. Steve King of his committee assignments a couple of years ago, the Iowa Republican was rendered largely irrelevant, and his congressional career evaporated soon after.\n\nBut as the dust settles on today's debate and vote, it's worth appreciating the extent to which this fight was about more than Gosar's indefensible video. It was also about overdue accountability for an odious public figure.\n\nWhen the Arizona Republican publicly associated with white nationalists , nothing happened. When Gosar praised insurrectionist rioters , nothing happened. When he tried to undermine public confidence in our electoral system and told voters that President Joe Biden is a \" fraudulent usurper ,\" nothing happened.\n\nBut when Gosar released a video in which he was depicted as a character who kills one of his colleagues, something finally happened.\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

He's effectively declared war on progressive politics of any kind - except when he can use their benefits to earn kudos.\n\nIn a press release Monday, Gosar took credit for airport improvements his district received as a result of the American Rescue Plan, a bill he whined about all the way through its enactment in March.\n\nGosar is just a two-faced politician whose self-serving hypocrisy explains, in part, why his own siblings revile him.\n\n\"I am pleased to announce that the City of Kingman will receive this critical funding for economic relief related to operational costs for cleaning and sanitizing the Kingman Airport to combat the spread of COVID-19,\" Gosar said in his press release. \"This funding is essential to maintaining safe and reliable air service to the community.\"\n\nBut Gosar voted against the relief plan - twice.

Paul Gosar , R-Ariz., seems to have a soft spot in his heart for white nationalists - particularly Nick Fuentes , who was recently subpoenaed by the House Jan. 6 committee over his potential involvement in the Capitol riot .\n\nOn Tuesday, The Arizona Republic brought to light a post Gosar shared last week on Gab - a social media platform popular among right-wing extremists - in which he complained about investigators looking into Fuentes' actions after the 2020 election.\n\nAs I wrote last month , the Jan. 6 committee is investigating what role Fuentes may have played in the Capitol riot. In the weeks leading up to the attack, Fuentes spoke at and organized rallies meant to spread former President Donald Trump's lie that the 2020 election was rigged against him.\n\nThe committee is also looking into a large Bitcoin payment Feuntes allegedly received from a French national ahead of the Jan. 6 attack and whether the payment was part of a coordinated effort to sow doubt in President Joe Biden's election victory.\n\nBut on Gab, Gosar painted Fuentes as a victim.\n\n\"The phony January 6th Committee's partisan witch-hunt continues as they have now set their sites on young conservative Christians like Nick Fuentes,\" he wrote. \"This is pure political persecution and it has to stop.\"\n\nFuentes reportedly replied, \"Thank you Congressman!\"\n\nThat friendly exchange between the two men wasn't the first time they'd crossed paths. Fuentes is well known in conservative and white nationalist circles, as a leader of the \"America First'' extremist movement.

Paul Gosar, of Arizona, signed onto the \" motion to vacate \" authored by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, of Georgia, both Republicans said Friday. If brought to the floor as a privileged resolution, it would force a vote within two legislative days on whether to oust Johnson as speaker. A simple majority vote would be needed to succeed.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie, of Kentucky, joined the motion to vacate earlier this week but has said he doesn't want to force a vote on it, instead pushing for Johnson to resign. The three Republicans and other hard-right members of the conference are furious at the speaker for bringing up votes to provide aid for Ukraine, particularly without U.S. border security provisions attached.\n\n\"We need a Speaker who puts America first rather than bending to the reckless demands of the warmongers, neo-cons and the military industrial complex making billions from a costly and endless war half a world away,\" Gosar said in a statement Friday.\n\nIf brought to the floor, those three Republican votes would be enough to remove Johnson as speaker if all Democrats vote against him. Some Democrats have indicated they would step in to save Johnson , but Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Friday that \"the pre-requisite to the conversation\" about saving Johnson is that the foreign aid bills pass \"in totality.\"\n\nThe addition of a third Republican on the motion to vacate is a huge blow to Johnson, raising the likelihood that he is either ousted from power or that he's saved by Democrats, which could further undermine him within the conference.\n\n\"Johnson is done,\" said one Republican who supports the speaker. \"It's sad.\"\n\nGreene \"has the votes,\" said another Republican. The member said they believe Democrats will vote to save Johnson - especially after the way the aid packages were structured, which drew the ire of some conservatives.\n\nMassie said the intention isn't to force a vote to oust Johnson but instead to show their numbers and get the speaker to resign on his own. That would avoid weeks of chaos on the floor, where the House must hold consecutive votes to install a speaker, and instead allow Republicans to meet behind closed doors and choose a new leader before Johnson voluntarily vacates the chair, Massie told reporters.\n\n\"The strategy all along has been to ask the speaker to resign in a fashion like John Boehner resigned, where John Boehner cleaned the barn and said, 'I'm leaving and you've got plenty of time to replace me,'\" Massie said. \"So, in that circumstance, we didn't end up with the speaker-less House. ... Just like when you leave a job, you give two weeks' notice, we're looking for Mike's notice.\"\n\nMassie suggested that a vote to oust Johnson could result in Republicans ending up in the minority; the balance of power is so close in the House that it wouldn't take much movement to elect Jeffries as speaker. Voting to remove Johnson would lead the House to hold vote after vote \"sometimes two times, three times a day,\" Massie noted. Thus voting for Jeffries just to end the chaos might start to look appealing to a handful of Republicans.\n\n\"If Johnson would do it in the manner that John Boehner did it, there's no chance to go into the minority because it's not fought out on the floor. ...  Jeffries is not on the ballot when we do this in conference,\" Massie stressed. \"And so that's the goal.\"\n\nHe added that he had 12 people in mind who could do a better job than Johnson.\n\nGreene has not indicated if or when she'll try to force a vote on the motion to vacate.\n\nGosar announced that he had joined the effort to oust Johnson just after the House voted to advance the package of four foreign aid bills - one for Ukraine, one for Israel, another for Taiwan and a fourth that attempts to counter China by providing a pathway to ban TikTok in the U.S. as well as other national security priorities.\n\nJohnson called the House package of foreign aid bills \"the best possible product that we can get under these circumstances,\" noting that Democrats control the Senate and the White House.\n\nHe said that a discharge petition from Democrats to force the House to take up a Senate-passed foreign aid package would have \"happened imminently\" if the House had not acted.\n\n\"The reality here is that if the House did not do this ... we would have had to eat the Senate supplemental bill,\" he told reporters.\n\nKyle Stewart is a field producer covering Congress for NBC News.\n\nJulie Tsirkin is a correspondent covering Capitol Hill.\n\nAli Vitali is a Capitol Hill correspondent for NBC News, based in Washington.

Common decency - and common sense - suggests Republican elected officials would want nothing to do with AFPAC and its organizers.\n\nAnd yet , Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia spoke at the radical gathering, and Republican Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona participated in the event by way of a pre-recorded video message. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said his members' role at the extremist assembly was \" appalling \" and \" unacceptable ,\" before ultimately deciding to do effectively nothing .\n\nLate last week, Politico reported that Gosar finally commented on the matter.\n\nRep. Paul Gosar is blaming his video appearance last month at a white nationalist-organized conference on his staff. The Arizona Republican also says he's done with event organizer Nick Fuentes, a far-right fringe figure who's trafficked in racist and anti-Semitic rhetoric.\n\n\"It wasn't supposed to go to Nick's group,\" Gosar told Politico, noting that a staffer \"misconstrued\" directions from his chief of staff. According to the far-right congressman, the tape was intended to go to other conservative gatherings as a general \"welcome video.\"\n\nThe Arizonan went on to say that the video \"just basically said, 'Welcome to the Miami area. Have a great conference. The United States is at a crisis point.'\" Gosar added that some groups had been \"authorized\" to receive the video, but due to a \"miscommunication,\" it was inadvertently sent to AFPAC organizers.\n\nIn other words, the congressman appeared via video at the white nationalist event, but we're now supposed to believe he did so accidentally.\n\nTo be sure, it's helpful that Gosar commented at all about the controversy, but I have a couple of follow-up questions.\n\nFirst, if there was a simple \"miscommunication,\" why exactly did it take the Republican lawmaker five weeks to explain what happened?\n\nSecond, if Gosar doesn't want to be associated with the America First Political Action Conference or its white nationalist organizer, why did he deliver the keynote address at last year's AFPAC event?\n\nAs for the Arizonan's role on Capitol Hill, McCarthy told reporters that he'd have a private chat with Gosar about his appearance. Asked whether he'd spoken to the minority leader about this, Gosar told Politico he hadn't.\n\n\"Why would I?\" he said, adding that he sent McCarthy a copy of the video. \"So there is nothing there,\" Gosar concluded.\n\nRelated:\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

Monahan, acting chief of the US National Park Police, during the House Natural Resources Committee hearing on unanswered questions about the Park Police's June 1 attack on peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square. (Photo by Bill Clark-Pool / Getty Images)\n\nUPDATE: The House of Representatives voted Wednesday, November 17, mostly along party lines, to censure Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar and remove him from the Natural Resources and Oversight committees. While Gosar did not express regret for his actions, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was clear that the threats she has received in recent months are very real. \"I believe this is a part of a concerted strategy and I think it's very important for us to draw a strict line a strong line for material consequence,\" she said. A rizona Republican Representative Paul Gosar's posting of an altered anime video that depicted him killing a colleague, New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, should be the last straw for the most dangerously delusional member of the US House of Representatives. As Representative Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) said, after Gosar shared the video and then mocked those who criticized him for doing so, \"This man should not serve in Congress.\" Omar is right. So is California Democrat Ted Lieu , who noted, \"In any workplace in America, if a coworker made an anime video killing another coworker, that person would be fired.\" Even House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , the California Democrat who weighs her words carefully when it comes to sanctioning members of the chamber, said, \"Threats of violence against Members of Congress and the President of the United States must not be tolerated.\" Pelosi has asked House minority leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) to join her \"in condemning this horrific video and [in calling] on the Ethics Committee and law enforcement to investigate.\" McCarthy has remained silent. Ocasio-Cortez predicts Gosar will \" face no consequences\" because McCarthy \"cheers him on with excuses\"-and because institutions fail to protect women of color. More From John Nichols The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" April 25, 2025 The Pope Who Decried the Savage Inequalities of Billionaire-Class Capitalism April 21, 2025 A Pope Who Prays for Palestine April 20, 2025 That's not a cynical interpretation of the problem with Republican extremism in the House. That's realism. Under McCarthy, the House Republican Caucus has become a breeding ground for hatred and violent threats. The caucus-which kicked Wyoming Representative Liz Cheney out of a leadership post after she dared to defend democratic norms following the deadly January 6 attack on the US Capitol by white supremacist supporters of defeated former President Donald Trump-tolerates members who are far more extreme, and dangerous, than Trump. While Republicans like Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene and Florida Representative Matt Gaetz get the most attention, they have plenty of company in the cadre of members whose behaviors were aptly described by Ocasio-Cortez when she used the word \"creepy.\" Gosar, who voted to overturn the 2020 presidential election results immediately after the violent insurrection rocked the Capitol, is arguably the most combative conservative in the chamber. He has defended January 6 rioters more vociferously than any of his colleagues. He claims that Ashli Babbitt, a QAnon follower who was killed by Capitol Police as she and a crowd of rioters smashed glass and tried to enter the Speaker's Lobby of the Capitol, was \" executed \" by authorities. Babbitt, he says, was a \"veteran wrapped in an American flag.\" Her death, he claims, was a homicide. Gosar even voted against awarding congressional gold medals to Capitol Police officers who protected members of the House and Senate-and assured that presidential election results could be certified-on January 6. Lately, Gosar has been attacking Department of Justice inquiries into what happened on January 6, claiming , \"The DOJ is harassing peaceful patriots across the country.\" He says reports on the violence that day are false-arguing that \"outright propaganda and lies are being used to unleash the national security state against law-abiding U.S. citizens, especially Trump voters.\" Despite repeated complaints from the Arizonan's colleagues and constituents, as Congressional Progressive Caucus chair Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) 0bserves , \"Representative Gosar has not released any statement across his public platforms denouncing the rioters or apologizing for his previous statements or role in inciting violence.\" Gosar is no newcomer to extremism. He has a history of consorting with white supremacists, white nationalists, and neo-Nazis , as the Arizona media has detailed. When the congressman unleashed a bizarre social-media attack on a Jewish reporter, an Arizona Republic columnist characterized the congressman's vitriolic statement as \"an ugly, unhinged and ultimately anti-Semitic rant.\" Gosar is so off-the-rails that members of his own family have called for his expulsion from the House . His brother, Dave, a Wyoming attorney, said in June, \" I consider him a traitor to this country .\" Another brother, Tim Gosar of Fort Collins, Colo., explained, \"He's set a dangerous sort of precedent along the 10 years he's been in office. When you talk about what happened the other day, you're talking about treason. You're talking about overthrowing the government. That's what this is.

(Photo by Bill O'Leary / The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nUnited States Representative Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) posted an anime-style video earlier this month that depicted him stabbing a fellow House member to death. The target of the congressman's online murder fantasy, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), called out her \"creepy\" colleague for his inexcusable action. Gosar's response? He claimed that he amplified this snuff film in order to \"reach out to the newer generation that likes these anime, these cartoons fabricated in Japanese likeness to actually tell them what is harmful in this bill [Biden's Build Back Better plan] that they're missing.\" The notion that a 62-year-old dentist turned politician thought he could make a connection with young voters by portraying a knife attack on a 32-year-old colleague tells us everything we need to know about Gosar's fragile state of mind. But the worst part of the controversy that gripped the Congress this week was the reaction from the vast majority of Republicans in the House. Given a chance to hold Gosar to account, 99 percent of them rejected the move to censure the Arizonan for posting \"a manipulated video on his social media accounts depicting himself killing Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking President Joseph Biden.\" In total, 207 Republicans voted against the censure resolution , which was approved mostly along party lines. Just two Republicans-the most ostracized and politically marginalized members of their party's House caucus-voted with House Democrats to hold Gosar to account: Wyoming Representative Liz Cheney, who has been excommunicated by her home-state party for supporting former President Donald Trump's impeachment, and Illinois Representative Adam Kinzinger, another Trump impeacher who has seen the writing on the wall and decided not to seek another term. The vote marks the latest instance of the Republican Party's degenerating into a crude cabal that threatens not only order in the House but even the basic underpinnings of US democracy. Rebuking Gosar should not have been difficult. As Ocasio-Cortez asked when she addressed her colleagues Wednesday, \"What is so hard? What is so hard about saying that this is wrong? This is not about me. This is not about Representative Gosar. But this is about what we are willing to accept.\" An answer came before the vote, when Liz Cheney recognized that House minority leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), whom she had once worked closely with as a member of the leadership team, would defend rather than admonish Gosar. \"It's a real symbol of his lack of strength, the lack of leadership in our conference right now,\" she said, \"and the extent to which he and other leaders seem to have lost their moral compass.\" More From John Nichols The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" April 25, 2025 The Pope Who Decried the Savage Inequalities of Billionaire-Class Capitalism April 21, 2025 A Pope Who Prays for Palestine April 20, 2025 Cheney was right, except they haven't \"lost\" their compass. It's been deliberately and permanently broken. Republicans in Congress have determined that the GOP is the party of impunity. They will reject any form of accountability for themselves and their associates. That was first made clear not on Wednesday but months earlier, on the evening of January 6, after Donald Trump incited his insurrectionist followers to storm the Capitol of the United States in an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election that he lost by 7 million votes. On that night, after the deadly violence and chaos had been brought under control, the majority of House Republicans joined Gosar in endorsing the goal of the insurrectionists. The group that voted to block certification of results from states won by Democrat Joe Biden included McCarthy. In June, the Republican leader joined Gosar and every House Republican, except Cheney and Kinzinger, in opposing the vote to create a select committee to investigate the January 6 attack. That came after Senate Republicans blocked a move to create a National Commission to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the United States Capitol Complex. At every turn, the Republicans of the 117th Congress have embraced the impunity of Paul Gosar. On January 13, only 10 House Republicans voted to impeach Trump for his role in inciting the insurrection, while Gosar and 196 opposed holding the former president to account. On February 13, only seven Senate Republicans voted to convict Trump , while 43 opposed accountability. On February 4, only 11 House Republicans voted to strip Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of her committee assignments for \"trafficking in racism, anti-Semitism and baseless conspiracy theories , along with her support for online comments encouraging violence against Democratic officials prior to taking office.\" Opposing accountability were Paul Gosar and 198 other Republicans, including McCarthy. This week, Greene revealed that McCarthy had promised that her committee assignments would be restored if Republicans win control of the chamber in the 2022 midterm elections. The same day, Time magazine speculated that an \" unmasked , unvaccinated and uncivil\" and \"wholly unaccountable\" Greene might be the future of the Republican Party. In fact, the future is here. On Wednesday, Republicans made it clear that the GOP is no longer the Grand Old Party of Abe Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, or Dwight Eisenhower-or even the dismal party of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. It is Gosar's Own Party . Or, after the pair stood together Wednesday and laughed off the censure vote, perhaps Gosar and Greene's Own Party . The Republican Party absolutely and unequivocally rejects accountability for Trump, for Greene, and now for Gosar. Their smashing of the moral compass does not stop in the House. The impunity displayed in Washington is being reflected in statehouses across the country. And, as a bogus assault on \"critical race theory\" gains traction as a political issue, in the meeting rooms where school boards gather . \"This nihilism runs deep,\" Ocasio-Cortez told the House on Wednesday . The representative from New York continued with a chilling reminder of why censuring Gosar was necessary, even if Republicans failed to take his actions-or their duty-seriously. \"As leaders in this country, when we incite violence with depictions against our colleagues that trickles down into violence in this country, and that is where we must draw the line independent of party, identity, or belief. It is about a core recognition of human dignity and value and worth. So when we talk about, as mentioned in the resolution, that these depictions are part of a larger trend of misogyny, racial misogyny, racist misogyny, in this has results in dampening the participation,\" said the brave and clear-eyed congresswoman. \"So this vote is not as complex as perhaps the Republican leader would like to make folks believe. It's pretty cut and dry,\" she added. \"Does anyone in this chamber find this behavior acceptable? Would you allow depictions of violence against women, against colleagues, would you allow that in your home? Do you think this should happen on a school board? In a city council? In a church? And if it's not acceptable there, why should it be accepted here?\"\n\nThe notion that a 62-year-old dentist turned politician thought he could make a connection with young voters by portraying a knife attack on a 32-year-old colleague tells us everything we need to know about Gosar's fragile state of mind.

That was first made clear not on Wednesday but months earlier, on the evening of January 6, after Donald Trump incited his insurrectionist followers to storm the Capitol of the United States in an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election that he lost by 7 million votes. On that night, after the deadly violence and chaos had been brought under control, the majority of House Republicans joined Gosar in endorsing the goal of the insurrectionists. The group that voted to block certification of results from states won by Democrat Joe Biden included McCarthy. In June, the Republican leader joined Gosar and every House Republican, except Cheney and Kinzinger, in opposing the vote to create a select committee to investigate the January 6 attack. That came after Senate Republicans blocked a move to create a National Commission to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the United States Capitol Complex. At every turn, the Republicans of the 117th Congress have embraced the impunity of Paul Gosar. On January 13, only 10 House Republicans voted to impeach Trump for his role in inciting the insurrection, while Gosar and 196 opposed holding the former president to account. On February 13, only seven Senate Republicans voted to convict Trump , while 43 opposed accountability. On February 4, only 11 House Republicans voted to strip Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of her committee assignments for \"trafficking in racism, anti-Semitism and baseless conspiracy theories , along with her support for online comments encouraging violence against Democratic officials prior to taking office.\" Opposing accountability were Paul Gosar and 198 other Republicans, including McCarthy. This week, Greene revealed that McCarthy had promised that her committee assignments would be restored if Republicans win control of the chamber in the 2022 midterm elections. The same day, Time magazine speculated that an \" unmasked , unvaccinated and uncivil\" and \"wholly unaccountable\" Greene might be the future of the Republican Party. In fact, the future is here. On Wednesday, Republicans made it clear that the GOP is no longer the Grand Old Party of Abe Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, or Dwight Eisenhower-or even the dismal party of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. It is Gosar's Own Party . Or, after the pair stood together Wednesday and laughed off the censure vote, perhaps Gosar and Greene's Own Party . The Republican Party absolutely and unequivocally rejects accountability for Trump, for Greene, and now for Gosar. Their smashing of the moral compass does not stop in the House. The impunity displayed in Washington is being reflected in statehouses across the country. And, as a bogus assault on \"critical race theory\" gains traction as a political issue, in the meeting rooms where school boards gather . \"This nihilism runs deep,\" Ocasio-Cortez told the House on Wednesday . The representative from New York continued with a chilling reminder of why censuring Gosar was necessary, even if Republicans failed to take his actions-or their duty-seriously. \"As leaders in this country, when we incite violence with depictions against our colleagues that trickles down into violence in this country, and that is where we must draw the line independent of party, identity, or belief. It is about a core recognition of human dignity and value and worth. So when we talk about, as mentioned in the resolution, that these depictions are part of a larger trend of misogyny, racial misogyny, racist misogyny, in this has results in dampening the participation,\" said the brave and clear-eyed congresswoman. \"So this vote is not as complex as perhaps the Republican leader would like to make folks believe. It's pretty cut and dry,\" she added. \"Does anyone in this chamber find this behavior acceptable? Would you allow depictions of violence against women, against colleagues, would you allow that in your home? Do you think this should happen on a school board? In a city council? In a church? And if it's not acceptable there, why should it be accepted here?\"\n\nBut the worst part of the controversy that gripped the Congress this week was the reaction from the vast majority of Republicans in the House. Given a chance to hold Gosar to account, 99 percent of them rejected the move to censure the Arizonan for posting \"a manipulated video on his social media accounts depicting himself killing Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking President Joseph Biden.\" In total, 207 Republicans voted against the censure resolution , which was approved mostly along party lines. Just two Republicans-the most ostracized and politically marginalized members of their party's House caucus-voted with House Democrats to hold Gosar to account: Wyoming Representative Liz Cheney, who has been excommunicated by her home-state party for supporting former President Donald Trump's impeachment, and Illinois Representative Adam Kinzinger, another Trump impeacher who has seen the writing on the wall and decided not to seek another term. The vote marks the latest instance of the Republican Party's degenerating into a crude cabal that threatens not only order in the House but even the basic underpinnings of US democracy. Rebuking Gosar should not have been difficult. As Ocasio-Cortez asked when she addressed her colleagues Wednesday, \"What is so hard? What is so hard about saying that this is wrong? This is not about me. This is not about Representative Gosar. But this is about what we are willing to accept.\" An answer came before the vote, when Liz Cheney recognized that House minority leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), whom she had once worked closely with as a member of the leadership team, would defend rather than admonish Gosar. \"It's a real symbol of his lack of strength, the lack of leadership in our conference right now,\" she said, \"and the extent to which he and other leaders seem to have lost their moral compass.\" More From John Nichols The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" April 25, 2025 The Pope Who Decried the Savage Inequalities of Billionaire-Class Capitalism April 21, 2025 A Pope Who Prays for Palestine April 20, 2025 Cheney was right, except they haven't \"lost\" their compass.

The Arizona Senate voted Tuesday, March 1, 2022, to censure Republican Wendy Rogers, whose embrace of white nationalism and calls for violence drew bipartisan condemnation. (Ross D. Franklin / AP Photo)\n\nIt's Wednesday evening as I write this, and the bloody, pointless, and potentially globe-wrecking war in Ukraine has now gone on for a week. In that week, Vladimir Putin has shown the world exactly who he is: a fanatical Russian nationalist, with a mystic vision of a greater Russia, the intellectual justifications for which seem to be on a par with Hitler's vision of a German Reich with Lebensraum carved out of his unfortunate neighbors' lands. Putin has sent thousands of young Russians to slaughter and be slaughtered against a neighboring state that he claims to believe is populated by Russia's brothers and sisters. To modify an old adage: \"With a brother like this, who needs enemies?\" The Russian leader has launched massive missile and artillery attacks against civilian neighborhoods. He has repeatedly threatened with an annihilatory nuclear response those who oppose him and his methods. He has made his own country a global pariah and ensured that his people will, even in a best-case scenario, live in deprivation for years to come, as Western sanctions gradually corrode the Russian economy. This is a moment when people of good conscience the world over ought to be rallying to demand peace, to demand an end to the increasingly vicious, and globally destabilizing, actions of the Russian autocrat. It is a moment when, after years of far-right drift, the GOP ought to publicly recommit to the principles of democracy and tolerance that make possible an open society. Instead, in this moment, Arizona GOP state Senator Wendy Rogers chose to speak at the white nationalist America First Political Action Conference in Orlando, Fla., where she announced that she fantasized about hanging her political opponents, so as to \"make an example of these traitors,\" and told the assembled white nationalists in her audience that they were \"patriots.\" Arizona voted for Joe Biden in 2020, and now has two Democratic senators-although one of them, Kyrsten Sinema, is doing a damn good impersonation of a Republican these days-but that doesn't mean its politics are reliably blue. It still has a GOP-controlled legislature, which has spent much of the past year debating ever more ludicrous and offensive ways to overturn the 2020 presidential election result, and it still has a GOP governor, Doug Ducey , who ran on a right-wing platform. Ducey has unapologetically embraced Rogers, despite her membership in the Oath Keepers, her identification with white nationalists, and her support for political violence. Days after Rogers's sickening antics, the Arizona Senate finally got around to censuring her, with most Republicans joining the Democrats in the 24-3 vote . But that's a far cry from removing her from office or actually kicking her out of the GOP.

Books & the Arts / Brett Christophers The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas Books & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins Current Issue View our current issue Rogers is joined by fellow gargoyles on the national stage. Two GOP members of the US Congress -Paul Gosar of Arizona and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia-also attended and spoke at the AFPAC event. So too did Idaho Lieutenant Governor Janet McGeachin . This was not some mildly provocative gathering; rather, it was a celebration of the most rabidly racist, fascist-worshipping fringe of American politics. That any elected politician would think it even remotely a good idea to attend such an event shows just how debased one wing of American politics has become. The Southern Poverty Law Center and other organizations that track hate groups and fascist leaders have documented AFPAC's leader Nick Fuentes 's repeated use of the N-word, his belief that America should be a \"White Christian\" nation, his Holocaust denialism, his fascination with Hitler, and his support for Vladimir Putin. Fuentes, a young provocateur who now runs a far-right podcast, attended both the neo-Nazi \"unite the right\" rally in Charlottesville in 2017 and the January 6 insurrection in D.C. in 2021. At the AFPAC event, Fuentes got the crowd to chant \"Putin! Putin!\" and compared him to another of his idols, Adolf Hitler. To this, the fascists in the audience whooped back, \"Let's go! Let's go!\" This was on February 25, two days after Putin had ordered his troops into Ukraine. Mitt Romney called the Republican lawmakers who attended this fascist hate-fest \" morons .\" That's a start. But why, doesn't in this moment of vast international peril, doesn't the GOP use this as an opportunity to clean house? Trump spent his four years as president cozying up to Putin. Now, in his wake, a significant part of the GOP has become essentially Putinesque. Some, like Greene, are happy to explicitly worship him; others simply seek to emulate his strongman assault on democratic institutions. This sort of politics ought to have no place in a major US political party. Calling a legislator a \"moron\" or slapping them on the wrist with a censure vote is easy; actually kicking them out of the party takes a bit more guts. But if they aren't kicked out of the party, the cancer nurtured and unleashed by Trump will continue to grow within America's body politic. In 2022, the democratic, pluralist, world is standing largely united in its abhorrence of Russia's actions. But will that response hold firm come November if the GOP-at least some of whose members, some of its base, and some of its media cheerleaders continue to flirt with Putinism-returns to power in Congress? Will that response hold firm if Trump emerges as the GOP presidential hopeful come 2024? Far better to nip this cancer in the bud now, and to expel members such as Greene, Gosar, and Rogers from the GOP before they do more damage. It's not enough for Romney and the \"grown-up\" Republicans to cluck their tongues in distaste and call their colleagues morons. It's time, once and for all, to force a break with this American authoritarianism, this dictatorial, supremacist impulse let loose by Trumpism. Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Arizona govenor Doug Ducey is running for re-election. He has reached his term limit and therefore cannot run for re-election.\n\nPutin has sent thousands of young Russians to slaughter and be slaughtered against a neighboring state that he claims to believe is populated by Russia's brothers and sisters.

That any elected politician would think it even remotely a good idea to attend such an event shows just how debased one wing of American politics has become. The Southern Poverty Law Center and other organizations that track hate groups and fascist leaders have documented AFPAC's leader Nick Fuentes 's repeated use of the N-word, his belief that America should be a \"White Christian\" nation, his Holocaust denialism, his fascination with Hitler, and his support for Vladimir Putin. Fuentes, a young provocateur who now runs a far-right podcast, attended both the neo-Nazi \"unite the right\" rally in Charlottesville in 2017 and the January 6 insurrection in D.C. in 2021. At the AFPAC event, Fuentes got the crowd to chant \"Putin! Putin!\" and compared him to another of his idols, Adolf Hitler. To this, the fascists in the audience whooped back, \"Let's go! Let's go!\" This was on February 25, two days after Putin had ordered his troops into Ukraine. Mitt Romney called the Republican lawmakers who attended this fascist hate-fest \" morons .\" That's a start. But why, doesn't in this moment of vast international peril, doesn't the GOP use this as an opportunity to clean house? Trump spent his four years as president cozying up to Putin. Now, in his wake, a significant part of the GOP has become essentially Putinesque. Some, like Greene, are happy to explicitly worship him; others simply seek to emulate his strongman assault on democratic institutions. This sort of politics ought to have no place in a major US political party. Calling a legislator a \"moron\" or slapping them on the wrist with a censure vote is easy; actually kicking them out of the party takes a bit more guts. But if they aren't kicked out of the party, the cancer nurtured and unleashed by Trump will continue to grow within America's body politic. In 2022, the democratic, pluralist, world is standing largely united in its abhorrence of Russia's actions. But will that response hold firm come November if the GOP-at least some of whose members, some of its base, and some of its media cheerleaders continue to flirt with Putinism-returns to power in Congress? Will that response hold firm if Trump emerges as the GOP presidential hopeful come 2024? Far better to nip this cancer in the bud now, and to expel members such as Greene, Gosar, and Rogers from the GOP before they do more damage. It's not enough for Romney and the \"grown-up\" Republicans to cluck their tongues in distaste and call their colleagues morons. It's time, once and for all, to force a break with this American authoritarianism, this dictatorial, supremacist impulse let loose by Trumpism. Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Arizona govenor Doug Ducey is running for re-election. He has reached his term limit and therefore cannot run for re-election.\n\nThe Russian leader has launched massive missile and artillery attacks against civilian neighborhoods. He has repeatedly threatened with an annihilatory nuclear response those who oppose him and his methods. He has made his own country a global pariah and ensured that his people will, even in a best-case scenario, live in deprivation for years to come, as Western sanctions gradually corrode the Russian economy. This is a moment when people of good conscience the world over ought to be rallying to demand peace, to demand an end to the increasingly vicious, and globally destabilizing, actions of the Russian autocrat. It is a moment when, after years of far-right drift, the GOP ought to publicly recommit to the principles of democracy and tolerance that make possible an open society. Instead, in this moment, Arizona GOP state Senator Wendy Rogers chose to speak at the white nationalist America First Political Action Conference in Orlando, Fla., where she announced that she fantasized about hanging her political opponents, so as to \"make an example of these traitors,\" and told the assembled white nationalists in her audience that they were \"patriots.\" Arizona voted for Joe Biden in 2020, and now has two Democratic senators-although one of them, Kyrsten Sinema, is doing a damn good impersonation of a Republican these days-but that doesn't mean its politics are reliably blue. It still has a GOP-controlled legislature, which has spent much of the past year debating ever more ludicrous and offensive ways to overturn the 2020 presidential election result, and it still has a GOP governor, Doug Ducey , who ran on a right-wing platform. Ducey has unapologetically embraced Rogers, despite her membership in the Oath Keepers, her identification with white nationalists, and her support for political violence. Days after Rogers's sickening antics, the Arizona Senate finally got around to censuring her, with most Republicans joining the Democrats in the 24-3 vote . But that's a far cry from removing her from office or actually kicking her out of the GOP.

He has reached his term limit and therefore cannot run for re-election.\n\nThis was not some mildly provocative gathering; rather, it was a celebration of the most rabidly racist, fascist-worshipping fringe of American politics. That any elected politician would think it even remotely a good idea to attend such an event shows just how debased one wing of American politics has become. The Southern Poverty Law Center and other organizations that track hate groups and fascist leaders have documented AFPAC's leader Nick Fuentes 's repeated use of the N-word, his belief that America should be a \"White Christian\" nation, his Holocaust denialism, his fascination with Hitler, and his support for Vladimir Putin. Fuentes, a young provocateur who now runs a far-right podcast, attended both the neo-Nazi \"unite the right\" rally in Charlottesville in 2017 and the January 6 insurrection in D.C. in 2021. At the AFPAC event, Fuentes got the crowd to chant \"Putin! Putin!\" and compared him to another of his idols, Adolf Hitler. To this, the fascists in the audience whooped back, \"Let's go! Let's go!\" This was on February 25, two days after Putin had ordered his troops into Ukraine. Mitt Romney called the Republican lawmakers who attended this fascist hate-fest \" morons .\" That's a start. But why, doesn't in this moment of vast international peril, doesn't the GOP use this as an opportunity to clean house? Trump spent his four years as president cozying up to Putin. Now, in his wake, a significant part of the GOP has become essentially Putinesque. Some, like Greene, are happy to explicitly worship him; others simply seek to emulate his strongman assault on democratic institutions. This sort of politics ought to have no place in a major US political party. Calling a legislator a \"moron\" or slapping them on the wrist with a censure vote is easy; actually kicking them out of the party takes a bit more guts. But if they aren't kicked out of the party, the cancer nurtured and unleashed by Trump will continue to grow within America's body politic. In 2022, the democratic, pluralist, world is standing largely united in its abhorrence of Russia's actions. But will that response hold firm come November if the GOP-at least some of whose members, some of its base, and some of its media cheerleaders continue to flirt with Putinism-returns to power in Congress? Will that response hold firm if Trump emerges as the GOP presidential hopeful come 2024? Far better to nip this cancer in the bud now, and to expel members such as Greene, Gosar, and Rogers from the GOP before they do more damage. It's not enough for Romney and the \"grown-up\" Republicans to cluck their tongues in distaste and call their colleagues morons. It's time, once and for all, to force a break with this American authoritarianism, this dictatorial, supremacist impulse let loose by Trumpism.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

That is the constitutionally appropriate and practically necessary response to a coup attempt that now appears to have involved not just violent right-wing extremists from across the country but also Republican representatives who swore an oath to \"support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.\" The identification process has been jump-started with Rolling Stone 's exclusive report, published Monday, revealing that congressional investigators had met with two planners of the January 6 \" Stop the Steal \" rally, at which former President Donald Trump incited insurrectionists to storm the Capitol. Those planners disclosed to the committee that they had meetings with House members or staffers as they planned rallies protesting the results of the 2020 election. Related Article The Department of Justice Is Letting the Coup Plotters Get Away Elie Mystal \"This is the first report that the committee is hearing major new allegations from potential cooperating witnesses,\" explained Rolling Stone , in its report on interviews with two of the January 6 protest planners. \"While there have been prior indications that members of Congress were involved, this is also the first account detailing their purported role and its scope.\" The planners identified Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene as one of the members they plotted with, along with Republican representatives and staffers from the offices of close to a dozen other members. Other House Republicans who engaged in the plotting, personally or via assigned staffers, reportedly included Republican Representatives Paul Gosar of Arizona, Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Mo Brooks of Alabama, Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina, Andy Biggs of Arizona, and Louie Gohmert of Texas. \"The two sources also claim they interacted with members of Trump's team, including former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, who they describe as having had an opportunity to prevent the violence,\" according to the report. This is more than enough information to compel the January 6 committee and the House Ethics Committee to immediately open investigations into the accusations against these members, with an eye toward confirming their involvement with the planning of the insurrection. If evidence of seditious activity is obtained, then the members should be expelled from the House in accordance with Section 3 or the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution .

But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability. Current Issue View our current issue Written in the aftermath of the Civil War to disqualify supporters of the Confederate rebellion against the United States, this section of the Constitution can be read as barring insurrectionists and their allies from seeking seats in the House and Senate. But it can also serve as a basis for expulsion of seditious members of the House, as Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) proposed Monday . \"Any member of Congress who helped plot a terrorist attack on our nation's capitol must be expelled,\" explained Ocasio-Cortez. \"This was a terror attack. 138 injured, almost 10 dead. Those responsible remain a danger to our democracy, our country, and human life in the vicinity of our Capitol and beyond.\" The vehicle for expulsion already exists, thanks to Representative Cori Bush (D-Mo.), who in January sponsored legislation to hold to account any House Republican who supported what she described at the time as a \"white supremacist coup.\" Bush did not get the support of Democratic leaders in the House. But she was speaking the truth about the motivations of the coup plotters; now, even President Biden echoes her language, saying, \"The violent, deadly insurrection on the Capitol nine months ago, it was about white supremacy, in my opinion.\" And she was outlining the only appropriate response to their congressional accomplices.

It directs \"the Committee on Ethics to investigate, and issue a report on, whether any and all actions taken by Members of the 117th Congress who sought to overturn the 2020 Presidential election violated their oath of office to uphold the Constitution or the Rules of the House of Representatives, and should face sanction, including removal from the House of Representatives.\" Bush's resolution, which has attracted 54 cosponsors , can be approved with a simple majority vote. That can jump-start the Ethics Committee inquiry. It can also signal to election officials in states across the country that members who have engaged in insurrection must be barred from ballots in 2022. The group Free Speech for People has contacted secretaries of state and other election officials to inform them that Section 3 of the 14th Amendment disqualifies \"elected officials who gave aid or comfort to the insurrectionists.\" The hope, according to constitutional lawyer John Bonifaz, the group's president, is that the state officials will bar seditionists from ballots in 2022 and 2024. Congressional support for Cori Bush's resolution serves a two-fold purpose. It can and should lead to expulsions of any and all members who aided the insurrection. It also formally identifies seditionists who should be barred from ballots. This is no time for forgive-and-forget politics. Members of Congress, Democrats, and responsible Republicans, have to have the courage to confront colleagues who invited deadly violence into the Capitol of the United States of America.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Like a Dickensian orphan, McCarthy has undergone humiliation after humiliation, repeatedly abasing himself before the likes of Donald Trump and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene in a desperate quest to be crowned head of the House. For his troubles, McCarthy finds himself rejected time and again. McCarthy's ordeal might be worthy of pity-if he himself weren't such a reprehensibly oily enabler of the far right. McCarthy's difficulty in securing the speakership isn't just a personal ordeal but evidence of the Republican Party's inability to govern. House Republicans have a knife-slim majority of 222 seats in a body of 435 representatives. The Democrats have 212 seats. McCarthy-or any other candidate-needs 218 votes to secure the speakership. The Democrats are united but fall short of that number. The Republicans have the votes, but remain divided in how they cast them. The party's slender majority has ensured that Republican leaders are caught in a bidding war between two competing factions of MAGA extremists: those like Greene who have already cut a deal with McCarthy and those like Matt Gaetz and Paul Gosar who want even more concessions from GOP leadership. Some of the demands of the holdouts are truly frightening. As Ryan Grim of The Intercept reports , North Carolina Republican Ralph Norman is demanding that McCarthy \"shut down the government rather than raise the debt ceiling.\" More From Jeet Heer A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump April 25, 2025 This President Has Many Puppet Masters April 21, 2025 Shawn Fain for President! April 18, 2025 Given this mess, it's not surprising that some centrists are offering an unorthodox and implausible scenario: that the Democrats step in and save the GOP by coalescing behind an alternative candidate, a moderate Republican. Writing in The New York Times , William S. Cohen and Alton Frye, both long-serving apparatchiks in the national security establishment, argue that the Democrats could \"offer motions to open the possibility of selecting a speaker capable of working across the aisle. Nominating an experienced, respected Republican from outside the House could trigger a contested ballot leading to a speaker in the mold of the original constitutional conception.\" Among the possible candidates that Cohen and Frye suggest are former Ohio governor John Kasich, outgoing Michigan Representative Fred Upton and outgoing Maryland Governor Larry Hogan. Steven Benen, a producer at MSNBC, made a similar pitch for Upton as a potential speaker.

Kasich and company are all either retired or on the way out precisely because their more-moderate faction of the GOP is near extinction. There is a reason the current House Republican spectrum runs from opportunistic allies of the hard right (like McCarthy) to the nihilist right (like Gosar and Gaetz). So it's hard to imagine that there's a sufficient number of currently serving Republicans who would join with the Democrats to create Speaker Kasich, Speaker Upton, or Speaker Hogan. More to the point, why should the Democrats join in a bargain to save the GOP, a rival party self-destructing in an entertaining civil war? It's not the job of Democrats to help the Republicans to govern-or to present a more moderate, but false, face to the world. Democrats' success in recent elections has hinged precisely on making it clear to voters that the GOP is an extremist party incapable of governing-an argument dramatically vindicated by the ongoing farce in the House. To be sure, Democrats might still be wise to make a deal with Republicans-if it were politically advantageous. There's some evidence that the Democrats are amenable to horse-trading. Speaking on MSNBC on Tuesday, Representative Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez noted , \"McCarthy's team may have to come to the Democratic Party. And if that's the case, then what would that even look like? It's rather unprecedented. Could it result in a potential coalition government? Could we get Democratic chairs of committees as a result?

Washington Post columnist Greg Sargent has fleshed out what Democratic Party demands in negotiations should be. \"So McCarthy wants Dem support?\" Sargent tweeted. \"Dems should make this the condition for *starting* talks: *permanent disabling of debt limit *no Holman Rule defunding investigations of Trump *no BS hearings designed to fake-discredit 1/6 findings *support for Tillis/Sinema-type border plan.\" As Sargent goes on to note, \"I don't actually think McCarthy can be trusted to honor any such deal, and there's no way he'd accept this anyway.\" In other words, any deal that Democrats could reasonably accept would be rejected by any likely coalition of existing House Republicans. Far more likely is a scenario where either McCarthy or some other House Republican does get the GOP holdouts to coalesce around a GOP consensus speaker, but at a cost of binding the party to a full extremist agenda: a game of chicken with the debt ceiling, the impeachment of Joe Biden, and two more years of chaotic governance. Even in that scenario, it makes sense for Democrats to push for a deal on their terms as a way of highlighting the differences between the two parties. There are 18 congressional Republicans in districts where Joe Biden won the presidential vote in 2020. The Democratic path to reconquering the House in 2024 goes straight through those districts. By offering a deal along the lines Ocasio-Cortez and Sargent suggest, Democrats could highlight the differences between the two parties: one committed to governance, and the other using politics as a theater of expressive rage. The next two years are likely to be chaotic, so Democrats need to keep reminding voters that the GOP is the party of chaos.\n\nFor his troubles, McCarthy finds himself rejected time and again.

Far more likely is a scenario where either McCarthy or some other House Republican does get the GOP holdouts to coalesce around a GOP consensus speaker, but at a cost of binding the party to a full extremist agenda: a game of chicken with the debt ceiling, the impeachment of Joe Biden, and two more years of chaotic governance. Even in that scenario, it makes sense for Democrats to push for a deal on their terms as a way of highlighting the differences between the two parties.

Kasich and company are all either retired or on the way out precisely because their more-moderate faction of the GOP is near extinction. There is a reason the current House Republican spectrum runs from opportunistic allies of the hard right (like McCarthy) to the nihilist right (like Gosar and Gaetz). So it's hard to imagine that there's a sufficient number of currently serving Republicans who would join with the Democrats to create Speaker Kasich, Speaker Upton, or Speaker Hogan. More to the point, why should the Democrats join in a bargain to save the GOP, a rival party self-destructing in an entertaining civil war? It's not the job of Democrats to help the Republicans to govern-or to present a more moderate, but false, face to the world. Democrats' success in recent elections has hinged precisely on making it clear to voters that the GOP is an extremist party incapable of governing-an argument dramatically vindicated by the ongoing farce in the House.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Responding to a question about the Capitol rioters who'd chanted \"Hang Mike Pence,\" Trump said those words were just \"common sense,\" given the fraudulence of the 2020 election. Two days later, Wyoming Republican Senator John Barrasso, who ran as a moderate but has since swung to the right, was asked by ABC's George Stephanopoulos about Trump's comment. Despite repeated prodding, Barrasso kept dodging the issue, emphasizing the need to move on and suggesting that there had been voting irregularities in the 2020 election that merited further investigation. Barrasso's dismal performance was even more ominous than Trump's initial comments. Trump is Trump, a known quantity. But Barrasso's cowardly inability to condemn him shows, once again, how thoroughly the Republican Party has been conquered by Trump, whose promotion of political violence now has the tacit approval of almost the entire party apparatus (with the few exceptions, like Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, increasingly pushed to the margins-if not driven out of public office completely). Trump occupies a curious position as an ex-president. Thanks to his social media blackout, he's barely visible as a public figure-but he remains a magnetic force that tugs the party toward him. His reckless incitement ensures that he continues to be banned from the major social media outlets and the mainstream media. But Trump's fans can easily follow his messages on Fox News and on fringe outlets like Newsmax and One America News. The mainstream media's blackout of Trump has done nothing to stop the circulation of his ideas or their ability to reshape the GOP. And these include the increasingly normalized threats of violence. When Republican Representative Paul Gosar tweeted an anime video showing him killing his Democratic colleague Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and swinging at President Joe Biden with two swords, there was hardly an elected Republican to be found to object or say that Gosar had crossed the line into indecency. Gosar's claim that he was just joking has become, through complicit silence, his party's line.

April 18, 2025 The normalization of threats of political violence has been an intensifying trend in 2021. At its core is the simple fact that Republican leaders like Barrasso have decided the party can't afford to lose Trump-or even Gosar. The GOP has become an alliance between the brutal and the craven. Surveying the rise of threats of violence in public life, The New York Times reported on November 12 that \" threats against members of Congress have jumped by 107 percent compared with the same period in 2020, according to the Capitol Police .\" Remarkably, the situation is so bad that the paper, habitually given to framing all political disputes as the fault of both parties, was frank about the role of the GOP. The Times report noted, \"From congressional offices to community meeting rooms, threats of violence are becoming commonplace among a significant segment of the Republican Party. Ten months after rioters attacked the United States Capitol on Jan. 6, and after four years of a president who often spoke in violent terms about his adversaries, right-wing Republicans are talking more openly and frequently about the use of force as justifiable in opposition to those who dislodged him from power.\" This analysis echoed a Reuters report on November 9.

And none have been charged with a crime by the law enforcement agencies alerted to their threats.\" The last point is crucial. Like Gosar's violent anime, many of the acts of intimidation that are becoming more common don't lend themselves to a law enforcement solution.

And these include the increasingly normalized threats of violence. When Republican Representative Paul Gosar tweeted an anime video showing him killing his Democratic colleague Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and swinging at President Joe Biden with two swords, there was hardly an elected Republican to be found to object or say that Gosar had crossed the line into indecency. Gosar's claim that he was just joking has become, through complicit silence, his party's line.

April 18, 2025 The normalization of threats of political violence has been an intensifying trend in 2021. At its core is the simple fact that Republican leaders like Barrasso have decided the party can't afford to lose Trump-or even Gosar. The GOP has become an alliance between the brutal and the craven. Surveying the rise of threats of violence in public life, The New York Times reported on November 12 that \" threats against members of Congress have jumped by 107 percent compared with the same period in 2020, according to the Capitol Police .\" Remarkably, the situation is so bad that the paper, habitually given to framing all political disputes as the fault of both parties, was frank about the role of the GOP. The Times report noted, \"From congressional offices to community meeting rooms, threats of violence are becoming commonplace among a significant segment of the Republican Party. Ten months after rioters attacked the United States Capitol on Jan. 6, and after four years of a president who often spoke in violent terms about his adversaries, right-wing Republicans are talking more openly and frequently about the use of force as justifiable in opposition to those who dislodged him from power.\" This analysis echoed a Reuters report on November 9. Current Issue View our current issue Profiling three individuals who'd made threats against elected officials, Reuters found some commonalities, including the fact that \"all described themselves as patriots fighting a conspiracy that robbed Donald Trump of the 2020 election. They are regular consumers of far-right websites that embrace Trump's stolen-election falsehoods. And none have been charged with a crime by the law enforcement agencies alerted to their threats.\" The last point is crucial. Like Gosar's violent anime, many of the acts of intimidation that are becoming more common don't lend themselves to a law enforcement solution. The threatening words and images are often vague enough that they fall under the legal definition of protected political speech.

(Photo by Brent Stirton / Getty Images)\n\nOne year after the January 6 insurrection that left at least five dead and briefly threatened to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the most blatant coup attempt in American history, every major participant in the plot remains politically active. Many of them occupy positions of power in the very US Capitol that was attacked by Donald Trump's minions. Instead of holding to account those who gave aid and comfort to insurrection, the Democrats who control the White House and both chambers of the Congress have diverted their scant energies on a bureaucratic path of least resistance. Their failure to respond is sinking the country deeper into crisis. Americans recognize the danger: A CBS News/YouGov poll finds that 66 percent of respondents believe that US democracy today is threatened, while 62 percent anticipate violence from the losing side in the next presidential election. Yet President Joe Biden and Democratic congressional leaders continue to avoid taking decisive action to address threats that become more potent, and widespread, with each passing day. Democrats with the power to demand accountability appear to be waiting for Republicans to come to their senses. But that's not going to happen. The former party of Lincoln has become the party of Trump, an authoritarian cult that seeks to dismantle democracy in order to reimpose the minority rule of a disgraced former president and his white nationalist henchmen. That's a fact, and it's not going to change, no matter how ardently Democrats repeat Wyoming Representative Liz Cheney's warning to her fellow Republicans: \"Our party has to choose. We can either be loyal to Donald Trump or we can be loyal to the Constitution, but we cannot be both.\" The Republican Party has chosen. Cheney's been booted from her position as a leader in the House Republican Caucus, and her home-state party has disowned her. Related Article The Best Way to Commemorate January 6 Is to Pass a Voting Rights Law Joan Walsh The best hope for protecting democracy is an action agenda to hold coup plotters and supporters to account. That does not absolve Democrats of their responsibility to act to avert gerrymandering, voter suppression, and any attempt by Republicans to rewrite election rules, intervene in election certification processes, or overturn results. But, without a clear focus on accountability, the Democrats are allowing Republican insurrectionists to believe they can do anything to subvert democracy without suffering consequences for their actions. What do we expect will play out on January 6, 2025, if the wrongdoing of insurrectionist legislators on or before January 6, 2021, goes unpunished? The efforts of the House Committee that has been investigating the insurrection, as plodding as the inquiry has been, can and should continue. Yet it is unclear whether the committee's efforts will amount to anything more than an information-gathering endeavor. Ultimately, we can hope that it will establish a permanent record of January 6 plotting and wrongdoing, and that the Department of Justice might take action based on that record. But there is no need to wait the months, perhaps even years, that it will take for the record to be complete. There are immediate steps that Democrats can and should take. US Representative Cori Bush has the best idea. The Missouri Democrat, who has led the push for accountability in the House, argues , \"We should commemorate the 1-year-anniversary of January 6th by passing my H.Res 25 to investigate and expel the members of Congress who helped incite the violent insurrection at our Capitol.\" Last January, in the immediate aftermath of the insurrection, Bush sponsored legislation to hold to account any House Republican who supported what she aptly described as a \"white supremacist coup.\" \"The actions of the Republican lawmakers who tried to overturn the valid results of the 2020 elections must not only be condemned in the strongest possible terms, but I believe the members who attempted to disenfranchise voters and incited this violence must be removed from Congress,\" Bush said of her resolution. Specifically, the legislation calls on \"the Committee on Ethics to investigate, and issue a report on, whether any and all actions taken by Members of the 117th Congress who sought to overturn the 2020 Presidential election violated their oath of office to uphold the Constitution or the Rules of the House of Representatives, and should face sanction, including removal from the House of Representatives.\" Bush has secured 54 cosponsors among House Democrats for her resolution, which can be approved with a simple majority vote of the House. The move Bush proposes is not merely permitted by the US Constitution. Constitutional lawyers such as John Bonifaz with the group Free Speech for People argue that it is mandated by that document, which declares in Section 3 of the 14th Amendment : No Person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States...to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability. The language of the amendment, along with the language Bush has employed in outlining her push for accountability, is instructive. It covers two types of offenders: those who actively engaged in plotting with insurrectionists and those who gave aid or comfort to the project. In the first category are a number of House members identified by planners of the January 6 \" Stop the Steal \" rally as having collaborated with them. Those Republican representatives who the planners allege personally engaged with them directly, or did so via assigned staffers, include Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Paul Gosar of Arizona, Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Mo Brooks of Alabama, Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina, Andy Biggs of Arizona, and Louie Gohmert of Texas.

But it should not be the end of that pursuit. Ethics Committee members in the House and the Senate should also consider appropriate actions that might be taken with regard to the eight senators and 139 representatives who, after the January 6 rioters left the Capitol, voted to sustain one or both of the objections to the election results that were under consideration when the Trump supporters attacked. Did they not give aid and comfort to the coup attempt by supporting the program of the insurrectionists? Should they not be held to account? In the Senate, Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown argued last year that two of his Republican colleagues, Missourian Josh Hawley and Texan Ted Cruz, had \"betrayed their oaths of office and abetted a violent insurrection on our democracy.\" He called for their resignations, saying, \"If they do not resign, the Senate must expel them.\" Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island said the Senate Ethics Committee \"must consider expulsion, or censure and punishment, of Senators Cruz, Hawley, and perhaps others.\" That was the necessary response in January of 2021. It remains the necessary response in January of 2022.\n\nInstead of holding to account those who gave aid and comfort to insurrection, the Democrats who control the White House and both chambers of the Congress have diverted their scant energies on a bureaucratic path of least resistance.

It remains the necessary response in January of 2022.\n\nAmericans recognize the danger: A CBS News/YouGov poll finds that 66 percent of respondents believe that US democracy today is threatened, while 62 percent anticipate violence from the losing side in the next presidential election. Yet President Joe Biden and Democratic congressional leaders continue to avoid taking decisive action to address threats that become more potent, and widespread, with each passing day. Democrats with the power to demand accountability appear to be waiting for Republicans to come to their senses. But that's not going to happen. The former party of Lincoln has become the party of Trump, an authoritarian cult that seeks to dismantle democracy in order to reimpose the minority rule of a disgraced former president and his white nationalist henchmen. That's a fact, and it's not going to change, no matter how ardently Democrats repeat Wyoming Representative Liz Cheney's warning to her fellow Republicans: \"Our party has to choose. We can either be loyal to Donald Trump or we can be loyal to the Constitution, but we cannot be both.\" The Republican Party has chosen. Cheney's been booted from her position as a leader in the House Republican Caucus, and her home-state party has disowned her.

That does not absolve Democrats of their responsibility to act to avert gerrymandering, voter suppression, and any attempt by Republicans to rewrite election rules, intervene in election certification processes, or overturn results. But, without a clear focus on accountability, the Democrats are allowing Republican insurrectionists to believe they can do anything to subvert democracy without suffering consequences for their actions. What do we expect will play out on January 6, 2025, if the wrongdoing of insurrectionist legislators on or before January 6, 2021, goes unpunished? The efforts of the House Committee that has been investigating the insurrection, as plodding as the inquiry has been, can and should continue. Yet it is unclear whether the committee's efforts will amount to anything more than an information-gathering endeavor. Ultimately, we can hope that it will establish a permanent record of January 6 plotting and wrongdoing, and that the Department of Justice might take action based on that record. But there is no need to wait the months, perhaps even years, that it will take for the record to be complete. There are immediate steps that Democrats can and should take. US Representative Cori Bush has the best idea. The Missouri Democrat, who has led the push for accountability in the House, argues , \"We should commemorate the 1-year-anniversary of January 6th by passing my H.Res 25 to investigate and expel the members of Congress who helped incite the violent insurrection at our Capitol.\" Last January, in the immediate aftermath of the insurrection, Bush sponsored legislation to hold to account any House Republican who supported what she aptly described as a \"white supremacist coup.\" \"The actions of the Republican lawmakers who tried to overturn the valid results of the 2020 elections must not only be condemned in the strongest possible terms, but I believe the members who attempted to disenfranchise voters and incited this violence must be removed from Congress,\" Bush said of her resolution. Specifically, the legislation calls on \"the Committee on Ethics to investigate, and issue a report on, whether any and all actions taken by Members of the 117th Congress who sought to overturn the 2020 Presidential election violated their oath of office to uphold the Constitution or the Rules of the House of Representatives, and should face sanction, including removal from the House of Representatives.\" Bush has secured 54 cosponsors among House Democrats for her resolution, which can be approved with a simple majority vote of the House. The move Bush proposes is not merely permitted by the US Constitution. Constitutional lawyers such as John Bonifaz with the group Free Speech for People argue that it is mandated by that document, which declares in Section 3 of the 14th Amendment : No Person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States...to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.

In the Senate, Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown argued last year that two of his Republican colleagues, Missourian Josh Hawley and Texan Ted Cruz, had \"betrayed their oaths of office and abetted a violent insurrection on our democracy.\" He called for their resignations, saying, \"If they do not resign, the Senate must expel them.\" Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island said the Senate Ethics Committee \"must consider expulsion, or censure and punishment, of Senators Cruz, Hawley, and perhaps others.\" That was the necessary response in January of 2021. It remains the necessary response in January of 2022.\n\nThere are immediate steps that Democrats can and should take. US Representative Cori Bush has the best idea. The Missouri Democrat, who has led the push for accountability in the House, argues , \"We should commemorate the 1-year-anniversary of January 6th by passing my H.Res 25 to investigate and expel the members of Congress who helped incite the violent insurrection at our Capitol.\" Last January, in the immediate aftermath of the insurrection, Bush sponsored legislation to hold to account any House Republican who supported what she aptly described as a \"white supremacist coup.\" \"The actions of the Republican lawmakers who tried to overturn the valid results of the 2020 elections must not only be condemned in the strongest possible terms, but I believe the members who attempted to disenfranchise voters and incited this violence must be removed from Congress,\" Bush said of her resolution. Specifically, the legislation calls on \"the Committee on Ethics to investigate, and issue a report on, whether any and all actions taken by Members of the 117th Congress who sought to overturn the 2020 Presidential election violated their oath of office to uphold the Constitution or the Rules of the House of Representatives, and should face sanction, including removal from the House of Representatives.\" Bush has secured 54 cosponsors among House Democrats for her resolution, which can be approved with a simple majority vote of the House. The move Bush proposes is not merely permitted by the US Constitution. Constitutional lawyers such as John Bonifaz with the group Free Speech for People argue that it is mandated by that document, which declares in Section 3 of the 14th Amendment : No Person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States...to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability. The language of the amendment, along with the language Bush has employed in outlining her push for accountability, is instructive. It covers two types of offenders: those who actively engaged in plotting with insurrectionists and those who gave aid or comfort to the project. In the first category are a number of House members identified by planners of the January 6 \" Stop the Steal \" rally as having collaborated with them. Those Republican representatives who the planners allege personally engaged with them directly, or did so via assigned staffers, include Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Paul Gosar of Arizona, Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Mo Brooks of Alabama, Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina, Andy Biggs of Arizona, and Louie Gohmert of Texas.

But local races in California, Nevada, and Arizona may shift the political landscape.\n\nWhile most of the political oxygen this week has been taken up by New Hampshire, to my mind the more interesting political developments have been occurring out West, as important Senate races take shape in California, Nevada, and Arizona.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong. I'm as happy as anyone to watch Trump have a hissy fit because Haley refused to immediately kiss the ring after his underwhelming primary win in New Hampshire. And I'm certainly not above enjoying the sight of the Orange Man threatening permanent banishment from MAGA-world for any funder who continues to drip money into Haley's probably doomed, mildly anti-Trump campaign. But let's set that aside and take a look at three Senate races that count.\n\nIn California this week, the top four contenders to replace Laphonza Butler, who stepped in as a temporary senator after Diane Feinstein's death last year, took part in a televised debate. Polls show that Adam Schiff is the favorite; the big question is who, in California's open primary on March 5, will come second and face him in the general election. Barbara Lee and Katie Porter are vying for California's more progressive voters; meanwhile, former Los Angeles Dodger Steve Garvey is running as a sort of Schwarzenegger-styled Republican, talking about practical concerns such as homelessness and public safety while generally steering clear of the more polarizing culture-war issues of the day. Garvey doesn't have a political background, giving him very little political baggage-but he does have at least a modicum of name recognition from his glory days back in the 1980s. In a recent poll , he came in second, edging out both Lee and Porter.\n\nNot surprisingly, Porter spent much of the debate on the offensive against Garvey, who looks to be her most immediate threat to advancing into the general election. The low-hanging fruit, in a state where barely a third of voters supported Trump in 2020, was to tag Garvey as a Trumpite. Porter, along with the other two Democrats, pressed Garvey repeatedly on whether he would vote for Trump in 2024, and Garvey repeatedly ducked the question. In fact, Garvey's response was a case study in disingenuousness. He would have to look at what both presidential candidates had done, he said, before making up his mind on how to vote.\n\nWhat the candidates have done? Let's see... On the one hand: insurrection, tax fraud, sexual assault, use of openly fascist language on the campaign trail, misuse of government office to secure personal gain from overseas governments, support for family separation policies, Muslim travel bans, flirting with white nationalists and paramilitaries, calling for the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to be executed, and an expressed willingness to invoke the Insurrection Act in order to sic the military on domestic opponents. On the other hand: presided over three-plus years of job growth, one of the largest infrastructure bills in US history, large-scale investments in green energy, and made a few physical stumbles and verbal gaffes that FoxNews has twisted into being signs of senility. Close call.\n\nThe ex-first baseman isn't going to be California's next senator, but he could conceivably make it into the general election runoff, where he will likely lose handily to whichever Democrat he squares off against.\n\nLess predictable are the outcomes of the races in Nevada, where Jacky Rosen is up for reelection, and in Arizona, where Kyrsten Sinema isn't running for reelection as a Democrat but might yet try to reclaim her seat as an independent.\n\nAnalysts in Nevada say that if Rosen's GOP opponent is Sam Brown -a veteran who was severely wounded by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan in 2008, and who was recruited as a candidate by the National Republican Senate Committee in an effort to field more moderate, reasonable candidates who would have some appeal to independents-it will be a close race. But the GOP base in Nevada has been anything but predictable in recent years; in 2022, it chose the election-denying Adam Laxalt to run against Catherine Cortez-Masto, and, despite the GOP's high hopes in that election, he lost-along with a slew of other election-denying candidates in Nevada. Currently, the GOP state chair, Michael McDonald , is facing felony charges for his role in the fake-electors plot in 2020.\n\nGiven the mood of that Nevada base, and given that Brown is now being portrayed by his opponents as the \"establishment\" choice, it's entirely possible that a less palatable candidate than Brown will win in the June senate primary- a candidate such as Jim Marchant , an extreme election-denier who ran for, and lost, the race for secretary of state in 2022. If so, that would be a marvelous gift for Rosen, and would likely ensure her reelection by a large margin.\n\nWhich brings me to Arizona-and a far more delicious story than Trump's histrionics in New Hampshire. Sinema isn't running as a Democrat, which is a smart strategy because, given her miserable record in the Senate these past years, she wouldn't win that primary. If she decides to throw her hat into the ring as an independent, in all likelihood her Democratic opponent in the general election will be progressive Representative Ruben Gallego, who is all but certain to win his party's primary. And her Republican opponent seems fated to be failed gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake, who has fine-tuned her appeal as a Trump-of-the-West, feeding the outrage machine with a drip-drip of innuendo, conspiracy-thinking, and misinformation. Recent polling has shown Gallego and Lake basically tied in a head-to-head, with the Democrat assuming a narrow lead if Sinema is included as an independent candidate.\n\nThis week, however, Lake dropped a political bomb that exploded all over the state Republican Party. She released a tape of Arizona GOP chair Jeff DeWit offering her what seems to be a bribe , paid for by unnamed important people back East, if she would drop out of the race in favor of a candidate seen as being more electable. DeWit asked the candidate how much money she would need in order to accept a corporate job instead of running for the Senate.\n\nThis week, months after the conversation took place, Lake's team apparently gave the chair an ultimatum to resign or reckon with leaks of even more damning recordings of his conversations. Perhaps not unwisely, DeWit chose to resign.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJeet Heer\n\nBooks & the Arts / Brett Christophers\n\nBooks & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins\n\nLake clearly hopes that publicly humiliating DeWit will serve to shore up her control over Arizona's GOP base. In the same way as Trump has driven out all so-called RINOs from the national Republican Party, so Lake is now hoping to reshape the Arizona party entirely in her image. In that, she'll probably be pushing at an open door. The Arizona GOP has long been on the cutting edge of extremism, its state legislators at the far-right edge of anti-immigrant policies, its national congressional delegation pocked with extremists such as Paul Gosar.\n\nBut there's precious little evidence that Arizona's electorate as a whole is on board with Lake's vision. After all, the state has been trending purple-to-blue in recent election cycles. In 2022, Lake lost the governor's race despite an anemic campaign by her Democratic opponent, Katie Hobbs. In 2024, the more voters start paying attention to what's on the line, and the more the dysfunction of the state GOP is on display-bribery, secretly taped conversations-the less palatable Lake will be as a candidate. With independents not sold on Lake's candidacy, the numbers suggest that if Gallego runs a strong campaign, he should be able to edge out both Sinema and Lake. Now surely that's worth more political oxygen than Trump's latest temper tantrum?\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

The 90-second clip, created by Representative Paul Gosar, Republican of Arizona, was a doctored anime depicting Mr. Gosar (flying around like a superhero) slashing the throat of a character with the face of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York (and also attacking President Biden with swords).\n\nOn Nov. 17, the House voted to censure Mr. Gosar and strip him of committee assignments. In his defense, Mr. Gosar insisted that the cartoon was merely a \"symbolic portrayal of a fight over immigration policy.\" (The video also contained images of the U.S. southern border, migrants and Border Patrol officers.)\n\nMr. Gosar had borrowed an excerpt from \"Attack on Titan.\" The popular anime series, by Hajime Isayama, features a small community of humans being menaced by the Titans, a race of gigantic rampaging monsters.\n\nAs James Stone-Lunde, a historian of Japanese culture, told me, \"The story explores themes of genocide, militarism, the importance of bloodlines and the need for ethnic self-determination,\" which has led some readers to interpret the series as, \"ethnonationalist apologia.\" Mr. Isayama however has never endorsed or acknowledged any such political intent, and has apparently sought to distance himself from this interpretation.\n\nIn his tweeted version, Mr. Gosar replaced one of the Titan's heads with that of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, granting her the role of a naked monstrous alien. He put his own head on the body of the soldier who slays the evil creature. Mr. Gosar also doled out heroic cameos to Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, and Representative Lauren Boebert, Republican of Colorado.\n\nIn her remarks during the censure hearings, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez made the points that the cartoon constituted an implicit death threat, and that circulating such a threat against one's colleagues would be wrong in any setting, \"a school board, City Council or in a church,\" regardless of political differences.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Why Republican Leaders Ignored the January 6th Hearing\n\nAt the first House select-committee hearing on the January 6th insurrection , last week, four law-enforcement officers presented excruciating details of their efforts to protect the Capitol and the lawmakers inside it from the mob that sought to disrupt the certification of the Presidential election. Aquilino Gonell, a Capitol Police sergeant, recalled how rioters set upon him, doused him with chemical irritants, and flashed lasers into his eyes. Michael Fanone, of the D.C. Metropolitan Police, said that he was Tased and beaten unconscious, and suffered a heart attack. Harry Dunn told of being taunted with a racist epithet that \"no one had ever, ever called\" him while he was \"wearing the uniform of a Capitol Police officer.\" Daniel Hodges, the youthful Metropolitan Police officer who was recorded on video being crushed in a doorway, used a single word twenty-four times to describe the people who rampaged through Congress. He called them \"terrorists.\"\n\nShortly after the insurrection, R. P. Eddy, a former director of the National Security Council, suggested on NPR that the reason the Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I. had missed every glaring sign of what some members of the group that Donald Trump liked to call his \"army\" were planning for the sixth had to do with \"the invisible obvious.\" It was difficult for officials, Eddy explained, \"to realize that people who look just like them could want to commit this kind of unconstitutional violence.\" Representative Adam Kinzinger, of Illinois, one of two Republicans who joined the committee, against the wishes of the House Minority Leader, Kevin McCarthy, noted something similar in his opening statement. \"We never imagined,\" he said, \"that this could happen: an attack by our own people fostered and encouraged by those granted power through the very system they sought to overturn.\"\n\nWhen Officer Hodges used the word \"terrorist,\" he was demanding that the obvious be made visible. This is also the essential task of the committee: to assemble a comprehensive record of January 6th showing that those who entered the Capitol were not, as Trump said, \"a loving crowd\" but political extremists, incited by the President and abetted by Republican members of Congress and other government officials, whose deference to a seditious demagogue represents an ongoing threat to the country.\n\nThe insurrectionists, however, called themselves \"patriots,\" seeming to believe that bearing the American flag earned them that title. To most people, the flag symbolizes the freedoms enshrined in the Constitution. But at the Capitol it was brandished as a weapon-along with the Trump flag, the Confederate battle flag, and the thin-blue-line flag-in an attempt to undermine what the committee's chair, Representative Bennie Thompson, called \"the pillar of our democracy\": the peaceful transfer of power. The insurrectionists, in calling themselves patriots, had absorbed a fundamental lesson of the Trump Presidency-how to pervert language so that the things you say are the opposite of what they actually mean.\n\nThat lesson was on display on the morning of the hearing, when Representative Elise Stefanik, who was once a vocal critic of the former President but has since become his willing enabler, stepped up to a bank of microphones outside the Capitol, alongside McCarthy. \"The American people deserve to know the truth-that Nancy Pelosi bears responsibility, as Speaker of the House, for the tragedy that occurred on January 6th,\" Stefanik said, alleging that Pelosi had \"prioritized her partisan political optics\" over the safety of the police. The Speaker of the House is not, in fact, in charge of security. But at least, one could argue, the woman who is now the third-ranking Republican member of the House recognizes that the events of January 6th were tragic.\n\nStefanik ascended to the leadership position because Representative Liz Cheney was ousted from it by her fellow-Republicans, this spring, for challenging Trump's lies that the election had been stolen. \"No member of Congress should now attempt to defend the indefensible, obstruct this investigation, or whitewash what happened that day,\" Cheney, who joined Kinzinger as the only other Republican on the committee, said at the hearing. Or, as Sergeant Gonell put it, \"What do you think people considering becoming law-enforcement officers think when they see elected leaders downplaying this?\" Nevertheless, both McCarthy and Mitch McConnell, the Senate Minority Leader, said that they had been too busy to watch the officers' testimony.\n\nMeanwhile, members of the now defunct America First caucus-a small cadre of House Republicans led by Marjorie Taylor Greene , whose attempt to promote \"Anglo-Saxon political tradition\" proved too retrograde even for other Trump loyalists in Congress-gathered outside the Department of Justice. Before hecklers could chase them away, they championed the more than five hundred people who have been charged so far in connection with the assault. Paul Gosar called those still in jail awaiting trial \"political prisoners,\" following the lead of Louie Gohmert, who, in May, on the House floor, said that they were \"political prisoners held hostage by their own government.\" This theme has become a talking point on the far right. Trump, too, has embraced it. Recently, on Fox News, he questioned why such \"tremendous people\" had been incarcerated.\n\nThe House select committee will reconvene sometime in August. Before that, according to Thompson, it is likely to begin issuing subpoenas to people, including some in the government, who may have known about events leading up to and surrounding the insurrection. Now that the Justice Department has allowed former officials to provide \"unrestricted testimony,\" Trump's Attorney General William Barr and his acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen are likely to be called. So are members of Trump's inner circle, including Representative Jim Jordan, who spoke with him that day. (Jordan was one of two Republicans nominated to the committee by McCarthy and rejected by Pelosi, for having challenged the legitimacy of the election and for calling the committee \"impeachment round three,\" after which McCarthy pulled all five of his nominees.) It's unclear if officials will honor subpoenas or ignore them, as happened during Trump's two impeachments, potentially forcing a protracted legal battle.\n\nIf they choose to obstruct the committee, the obvious-an invitation to incite and carry out future acts of insurrection-will be visible for all to see. The pillar of American democracy may yet be the final casualty of January 6th. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

He has sighed, nodded sarcastically, and, at one point, asked a Republican congressman who questioned who might be funding Cohen's legal team if he would like to contribute to it. Cohen was perhaps least enamored with Representative Jim Jordan, of Ohio, who, as other Republicans have throughout the hearing, repeatedly impugned Cohen's honesty, citing his lies to Congress in 2017. At one point, Jordan claimed that Cohen disputed the illegality of his own actions. \"His remorse is nonexistent,\" Jordan yelled. \"He just debated a member of Congress, saying he really didn't do anything wrong with the false bank things I'm guilty of and going to prison for!\"\n\nIn fact, as Cohen then replied, he had acknowledged his guilt at multiple points during the hearing. \"You know that's not what I said. I pled guilty, and I take responsibility for my actions. Shame on you, Mr. Jordan. That's not what I said.\"\n\nRepresentative Mark Meadows, of North Carolina, one of Cohen's main Republican antagonists, took issue with Cohen's characterization of President Trump as a racist, offering the opinion of the former Eric Trump Foundation employee and current Housing and Urban Development official Lynne Patton, who is African-American, as counter-evidence, after summoning her to stand behind him silently, as a prop.\n\n\"You made some very demeaning comments about the President that Miss Patton doesn't agree with,\" Meadows said. \"In fact, it has to do with racism. She says that, as a daughter of a man born in Birmingham, Alabama, that there was no way that she would work for an individual who was racist.\"\n\n\"Do you have proof?\" Meadows asked Cohen, loudly.\n\n\"I do,\" Cohen replied.\n\n\"Yes or no,\" Meadows said.\n\n\"I do,\" Cohen replied again.\n\n\"Where's the proof?\" Meadows demanded.\n\n\"Ask Miss Patton,\" Cohen said, \"how many people who are black are executives at the Trump Organization.\"\n\nMeadows cut him off. \"Mr. Cohen, Mr. Cohen, we could go through this. I would ask unanimous consent that her entire statement be put in the record.\"\n\nAt one point, Republicans put up a poster featuring a blown-up image of Cohen's face which read \"Liar, liar, pants on fire,\" a sentence actually said by Representative Paul Gosar, of Arizona. Cohen referred to the poster in his answer to a question about why he turned against the President. \"There are several factors,\" Cohen said. \"Helsinki, Charlottesville, watching the daily destruction of our civility to one another, putting up silly things like this.\" At \"this,\" he pointed to the sign, which was promptly taken down and replaced with another. \"Really unbecoming of Congress.\"\n\nOne of the more dramatic moments for Republicans on the committee involved a document Cohen had filled out indicating that he hadn't been employed as a lobbyist for a foreign government in the past two years. When Cohen said that he had, in fact, worked for foreign entities, Meadows held up the document and claimed that Cohen had committed perjury by not disclosing those entities on the form.\n\n\"Why didn't you put them on the form?\" Meadows shouted. \"It says it's a criminal offense not to put them on this form! For the last two years-why didn't you do that?\"\n\nThere was some rustling in the background after Meadows' remarks, as he showed the document to an animated G.O.P. colleague, Representative Jordan. But Representative Katie Hill, a Democrat of California, deflated this line of attack.\n\n\"The question is, in fact, whether witnesses have any contracts or payments originating with a foreign government,\" Hill said. \"It does not cover all foreign entities, just foreign-government entities.\"\n\nWe've heard little about the document since. The day wears on.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "The Devastating New History of the January 6th Insurrection\n\nThe New Yorker is publishing the full report of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack, in partnership with Celadon Books. The edition contains a foreword by the magazine's editor, David Remnick, which you'll find below, and an epilogue by Representative Jamie Raskin, a member of the committee. Order the full report .\n\nIn the weeks while the House select committee to investigate the insurrection at the Capitol was finishing its report, Donald Trump, the focus of its inquiry, betrayed no sense of alarm or self-awareness. At his country-club exile in Palm Beach, Trump ignored the failures of his favored candidates in the midterm elections and announced that he was running again for President. He dined cheerfully and unapologetically with a spiralling Kanye West and a young neo-fascist named Nick Fuentes. He mocked the government's insistence that he turn over all the classified documents that he'd hoarded as personal property. Finally, he declared that he had a \"major announcement,\" only to unveil the latest in a lifetime of grifts. In the old days, it was Trump University, Trump Steaks, Trump Ice. This time, he was hawking \"limited edition\" digital trading cards at ninety-nine dollars apiece, illustrated portraits of himself as an astronaut, a sheriff, a superhero. The pitch began with the usual hokum: \"Hello everyone, this is Donald Trump, hopefully your favorite President of all time, better than Lincoln, better than Washington.\"\n\nIn his career as a New York real-estate shyster and tabloid denizen, then as the forty-fifth President of the United States, Trump has been the most transparent of public figures. He does little to conceal his most distinctive characteristics: his racism, misogyny, dishonesty, narcissism, incompetence, cruelty, instability, and corruption. And yet what has kept Trump afloat for so long, what has helped him evade ruin and prosecution, is perhaps his most salient quality: he is shameless. That is the never-apologize-never-explain core of him. Trump is hardly the first dishonest President, the first incurious President, the first liar. But he is the most shameless. His contrition is impossible to conceive. He is insensible to disgrace.\n\nOn December 19, 2022, the committee spelled out a devastating set of accusations against Trump: obstruction of an official proceeding; conspiracy to defraud the nation; conspiracy to make false statements; and, most grave of all, inciting, assisting, aiding, or comforting an insurrection. For the first time in the history of the United States, Congress referred a former President to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. The criminal referrals have no formal authority, though they could play some role in pushing Jack Smith, the special counsel appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland, to issue indictments. The report certainly adds immeasurably to the wealth of evidence describing Trump's actions and intentions. One telling example: The committee learned that Hope Hicks, the epitome of a loyal adviser, told Trump more than once in the days leading up to the protest to urge the demonstrators to keep things peaceful. \"I suggested it several times Monday and Tuesday and he refused,\" she wrote in a text to another adviser. When Hicks questioned Trump's behavior concerning the insurrection and the consequences for his legacy, he made his priorities clear: \"Nobody will care about my legacy if I lose. So, that won't matter. The only thing that matters is winning.\"\n\nTrump has been similarly dismissive of the committee's work, going on the radio to tell Dan Bongino, the host of \"The Dan Bongino Show,\" that he had been the victim of a \"kangaroo court.\" On Truth Social, his social-media platform, he appealed to the loyalty of his supporters: \"Republicans and Patriots all over the land must stand strong and united against the Thugs and Scoundrels of the Unselect Committee.... These folks don't get it that when they come after me, the people who love freedom rally around me. It strengthens me. What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.\"\n\nExperience makes it plain that Trump will just keep going on like this, deflecting, denying, lashing out at his accusers, even if it means that he will end his days howling in a bare and echoing room. It matters little that the report shows that even members of his innermost circle, from his Attorney General to his daughter, know the depths of his vainglorious delusions. He will not repent. He will not change. But the importance of the committee's report has far less to do with the spectacle of Trump's unravelling. Its importance resides in the establishment of a historical record, the depth of its evidence, the story it tells of a deliberate, coördinated assault on American democracy that could easily have ended with the kidnapping or assassination of senior elected officials, the emboldenment of extremist groups and militias, and, above all, a stolen election, a coup.\n\nThe committee was not alone in its investigation. Many journalists contributed to the steady accretion of facts. But, with the power of subpoena, the committee was able to uncover countless new illuminating details. One example: In mid-December, 2020, the Supreme Court threw out a lawsuit filed by the State of Texas that would have challenged the counting of millions of ballots. Trump, of course, supported the suit. He was furious when it, like dozens of similar suits, was dismissed. According to Cassidy Hutchinson, who worked directly for Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, Trump was \"raging\" about the decision: \"He had said something to the effect of, 'I don't want people to know we lost, Mark. This is embarrassing. Figure it out. We need to figure it out. I don't want people to know that we lost.'\"\n\nIn large measure, this report is the story of how Trump, humiliated by his loss to Joe Biden, conspired to obstruct Congress, defraud the country he was pledged to serve, and incite an insurrection to keep himself in power.\n\nThe origins of the committee and its work are plain: On January 6, 2021, thousands marched on the Capitol in support of Trump and his conspiratorial and wholly fabricated charge that the Presidential election the previous November had been stolen from him. Demonstrators breached police barricades, broke through windows and doors, and ran through the halls of Congress threatening to exact vengeance on the Vice-President, the Speaker of the House, and other officeholders. Seven people died as a result of the insurrection. About a hundred and fourteen law-enforcement officers were injured.\n\nHalf a year later, the House of Representatives voted to establish a panel charged with investigating every aspect of the insurrection-including the role of the former President. An earlier attempt in the Senate to convene an investigative panel had met with firm resistance from the Minority Leader, Mitch McConnell, who called it an \"extraneous\" project; despite support from six Republican senators, it failed to get the sixty votes required. It was left to the Democratic leadership in the House to form a committee. The vote, held on June 30, 2021, was largely along party lines, but the U.S. House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol officially came into existence.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi then asked the Republicans to name G.O.P. members to join the panel. The House Minority Leader, Kevin McCarthy, responded by proposing some of the most prominent election deniers in his caucus, including Jim Jordan, of Ohio, who had attended \"Stop the Steal\" demonstrations and was sure to behave as an ardent obstructionist. Pelosi, who had named Liz Cheney, of Wyoming, to the panel, rejected two of McCarthy's five recommendations, saying, \"The unprecedented nature of January 6th demands this unprecedented decision.\" After conferring with Trump, McCarthy refused to provide alternatives, and abruptly withdrew all of his proposals, gambling that doing so would derail or discredit the initiative. Pelosi, in turn, asked a second Republican who had, with Cheney, voted to impeach the President on a vote held on January 13th-Adam Kinzinger, of Illinois-to serve on the committee. Both Cheney and Kinzinger accepted.\n\nCheney, a firm conservative and the daughter of former Vice-President Dick Cheney, had made her judgment of Trump well known. \"The President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack,\" she said not long after the insurrection. \"Everything that followed was his doing.\" She knew that by opposing Trump and joining Kinzinger and the Democrats on the committee she was almost sure to lose her seat in Congress. She didn't care, she said later, declaring her work on the panel, on which she served as vice-chair, the \"most important\" of her career. The G.O.P. leadership was unimpressed with this declaration of principle. In February, 2022, the Republican National Committee censured both Cheney and Kinzinger.\n\nIn deciding how to proceed with its investigation, the committee's chairman, Bennie G. Thompson, of Mississippi, along with Liz Cheney and the seven other members, looked to a range of similarly high-profile investigative panels of the past, including the so-called Kefauver Committee, which investigated organized crime, in 1950-51; the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, known as the Warren Commission, in 1963-64; the Senate Watergate hearings, in 1973; the Iran-Contra hearings, in 1987; and, particularly, the 9/11 Commission, in 2002-04. The committee hired staff investigators who had worked in the Department of Justice and in law enforcement, and they conducted more than a thousand interviews. Teams were color-coded and tasked with making \"deep dives\" into various aspects of January 6th. The division of labor included a \"blue team,\" which examined the preparation for and the reaction to events by law enforcement; a \"green team,\" which examined the financial backing for the plot; a \"purple team,\" which conducted an analysis of the extremist groups involved in the storming of the Capitol; a \"red team,\" which studied the rally on the Ellipse and the Stop the Steal movement; and a \"gold team,\" which looked specifically at Trump's role in the insurrection.\n\nCommittee members also insisted on inquiring into whether Trump planned to use emergency powers to overturn the vote, call out the National Guard, and invoke the Insurrection Act. Was Trump's inaction during the rioting on Capitol Hill merely a matter of miserable leadership, or was it a deliberate strategy of fomenting chaos in order to stay in the White House? \"That dereliction of duty causes us real concern,\" Thompson said. In this way, an inquiry into a specific episode broadened to encompass a topic of still greater significance: Had the President sought to undermine and circumvent the American system of electoral democracy?\n\nThe political urgency of the committee's work was geared to the calendar. Members had initially hoped to complete and publish a report before the 2022 midterm elections. But that proved impossible, such was the volume of evidence. Still, the committee members knew they could not go on indefinitely. The Republicans were likely to win back a majority in the House, in November, and McCarthy, who was the most likely to succeed Nancy Pelosi as Speaker, would almost certainly choose not to reauthorize the committee, effectively shutting it down; it was also quite possible, they knew, that McCarthy and the Republicans might generate \"counter\" hearings as an act of retribution.\n\nAs the committee began its work, it was soon clear that the Republican leadership in the House had made a tactical error in refusing to appoint any members to the panel. Even Republicans less vociferous than Jordan would have had the power to slow down the investigations, debate points with Democratic members, and appoint less aggressive staff members. Instead, the committee, with its seven Democrats and two anti-Trump Republicans, worked in relative harmony, taking full advantage of a sense of common purpose and the capacities of a congressional committee.\n\nStill, they faced predictable obstacles. Not only did many Trump loyalists refuse to testify; much of the American public was, after so many previous investigations, impeachments, scandals, and news alerts, weary of hearing about the unending saga of Donald Trump. Who would pay attention? What more was there to learn? In a polarized America, who was left to be persuaded? Committee members such as Jamie Raskin, of Maryland, insisted that the real purpose of the investigation was to establish the truth. What prosecutors and the electorate make of those facts is beyond the committee's authority.\n\nThe committee members determined that they could not go about the hearings in the old way, with day after day of interminable questioning of witnesses. Instead, they needed to produce discrete, well-produced, briskly paced multimedia \"episodes\" designed to highlight various aspects of the insurrection: its origins, its funding, the behavior of the President, the level of involvement by white nationalists, militias, and other menacing groups. The members agreed that, in an age of peak TV, they needed to present a kind of series, one that was dramatic, accessible, accurate, evidence-rich, and convincing. Ideally, they would provide a narrative that did not merely preach to the converted but reached the millions of Americans who were indifferent to or confused by the unending stream of noise, indirection, hysteria, lying, and chaos that had characterized the hyperpolarized era. The committee also recognized that only a minority would watch the full hearings, much less read every word of a long narrative report months later. They needed to produce the hearings in a way that could also be transmitted effectively in bits on social media and go viral. They needed memorable moments and characters. In the words of one staffer, \"We needed to bring things to life.\"\n\nTo help with that effort, the committee hired an adviser, the British-born television producer James Goldston, who had been a foreign correspondent for the BBC in Northern Ireland and Kosovo. Goldston had also covered the impeachment of Bill Clinton. In 2004, he moved to New York and went to work at ABC, where he ran \"Good Morning America\" and \"Nightline\"; between 2014 and 2021, he served as president of ABC News. The committee decided to videotape its depositions, and Goldston was among those who helped to select brief and particularly vivid moments from those long interviews, the way a journalist uses quotations or scenes to enliven a piece of narrative prose. The committee's presentations also employed everything from surveillance video to police radio traffic to the e-mails and tweets of government officials, right-wing media personalities, militia leaders, and the insurrectionists on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"We live in an era where, no matter how important the subject, it's competing for attention,\" Goldston told a reporter for TheWrap. \"People are distracted, people have got a lot going on. And so, the hope was, by bringing these new techniques to this format, that we could engage people in a way that perhaps they wouldn't otherwise have been.\" The second prime-time hearing brought in nearly eighteen million viewers, an audience comparable to NBC's \"Sunday Night Football.\" The Republican House leadership was predictably unimpressed with the committee's commitment to narrative, prompting Kevin McCarthy to say that the Democrats had hired Goldston to \"choreograph their Jan. 6 political theater.\"\n\nThe committee's published report does not have a single authorial voice. Rather, it is a collaborative effort written mainly by a team of investigators and staffers, with input from members of the committee. And, while it lacks a mediating, consistent voice, it is a startlingly rich narrative, thick with details of malevolent intent, political conspiracy, sickening violence, and human folly. There is no question that historians will feast on these pages; what the Department of Justice does with this evidence remains to be seen.\n\nAt times, there's comedy embedded in this tragic narrative. A figure such as Eric Herschmann, a Trump adviser, holds the stage long enough to recount telling the Trump lawyer John Eastman that his plan to overturn the election is \"completely crazy\": \"Are you out of your effing mind?\" And: \"Get a great effing criminal defense lawyer. You're gonna need it.\" Viewers of Herschmann's deliciously profane taped testimony were transfixed by at least two artifacts on the wall behind him: a baseball bat with the word \"Justice\" written on it and a print of \"Wild Thing,\" Rob Pruitt's image of a panda, which also makes an appearance in the erotic thriller \"Fifty Shades of Grey.\"\n\nAnyone who watched the hearings and who now reads this report will dwell at times on the outsized figures who emerge, either in their own testimony or as described by others: the neo-fascistic campaign strategist and onetime White House aide Steve Bannon; the blandly ambitious Mark Meadows, the chief of staff in the final year of the Trump Administration; and, of course, the oft-inebriated Rudy Giuliani, the onetime New York City mayor and Trump's personal lawyer.\n\nTime and again, senior figures in the drama refused to testify, hiding behind claims of executive privilege. The report includes many comical instances of would-be witnesses claiming their Fifth Amendment rights and refusing to answer questions as benign as where they went to college. And so it was often the junior staffers in the Administration, with far less to spend on legal fees and with their futures at risk, who stepped forward to describe what they had seen and heard. The most memorable such episode came on June 28th, when Cassidy Hutchinson, the earnest young aide to Meadows, testified live before the committee. Hutchinson had already been deposed four times, for a total of more than twenty hours. Liz Cheney, as the vice-chair, began the session by announcing that Hutchinson had received an ominous phone call from someone in Trump's circle saying, \"He wants me to let you know he's thinking about you. He knows you're loyal. And you're going to do the right thing when you go in for your deposition.\" Cheney bluntly referred to this as tantamount to witness tampering. When the report and its accompanying materials were finally released, we learned that Hutchinson told the committee that a former Trump White House lawyer named Stefan Passantino, who represented her early in the process, had instructed her to feign a faulty memory and \"focus on protecting the President.\" She said Passantino made it plain that he would help find her \"a really good job in Trump world\" so long as she protected \"the family.\" Hutchinson also testified that an aide to Meadows, Ben Williamson, had passed along a message from Meadows that he \"knows that you'll do the right thing tomorrow and that you're going to protect him and the boss.\"\n\nBut Hutchinson, who had been a loyal staffer in the Trump White House, privy to countless conversations in and around the offices of the President and the chief of staff, would not be intimidated. She found new counsel and thwarted the thuggish attempts to gain her silence, delivering some of the most damning testimony of the investigation. She described conversations, some secondhand, that made it plain that Trump knew full well that he had lost the election but would stop at nothing to keep power. Because of her preternatural calm before the microphone, the uninflected, more-in-sadness-than-in-anger tone of her delivery, Hutchinson was often compared to John Dean, the White House counsel under Richard Nixon, who emerged from the Watergate hearings as the most memorable and decisive witness.\n\nBut the nature of Hutchinson's testimony, in keeping with the era, was distinctly more lurid than Dean's. She recalled how Trump hurled his lunch against the wall, splattering ketchup everywhere, when he learned that Attorney General William Barr had publicly declared that there was, in fact, no evidence of election fraud. On other occasions, she said, the President pulled out \"the tablecloth to let all the contents of the table go onto the floor and likely break or go everywhere.\" She recounted the names of the many Trumpists-including Meadows, Giuliani, Matt Gaetz, and Louie Gohmert-who had requested that Trump grant them pardons in connection with the Capitol attack. She said that, three days before the insurrection, the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, told Trump that, if he carried out his plan to march to the Capitol with the crowds, \"we're going to get charged with every crime imaginable.\" Hutchinson testified that on January 6th Cipollone told Meadows, \"They're literally calling for the Vice President to be effing hung.\" As she recalled, \"Mark had responded something to the effect of 'You heard him, Pat. He thinks Mike deserves it. He doesn't think they're doing anything wrong.' \"\n\nFinally, Hutchinson made it clear just how much Trump had wanted to join the insurrectionists on Capitol Hill. Trump was so incensed with his Secret Service detail for refusing to take him there, she testified, that he lunged at the agent driving his car and struggled for the wheel. The report corroborates Hutchinson's testimony, saying that the \"vast majority\" of its law-enforcement sources described a \"furious interaction\" between the President and his security contingent in his S.U.V. The sources said that Trump was \"furious,\" \"insistent,\" \"profane,\" and \"heated.\" The committee concluded that Trump had hoped to lead the effort to overturn the election either from inside the House chamber or from a stage outside the building.\n\nHutchinson was equally forthright about Trump's disregard for public safety. Despite being told that many of the supporters who came out to see him speak on January 6th were armed, she said, Trump insisted that the Secret Service remove the \"mags\"-the metal detectors. He was not terribly concerned that someone might be killed or injured, so long as it wasn't him. \"I don't fucking care that they have weapons,\" he said, according to Hutchinson. \"They're not here to hurt me.\"\n\nThe insurrection at the Capitol was of such grave consequence for liberal democracy and the rule of law that commentators have struggled ever since to find some historical precedent to provide context and understanding to a nation in a state of continuing crisis. Some thought immediately of the sack of the Capitol, in 1814, though the perpetrators then were foreign, soldiers of the British crown. Others have pointed to contested Presidential elections of the past-1824, 1876, 1960, 2000-but those ballots were certified, peacefully and lawfully, by Congress. None of the losers sought to foment an uprising or create a national insurgency. Compare Trump's self-absorption and rage with Al Gore's graceful acceptance of the Supreme Court's decision handing the election to George W. Bush: \"Tonight, for the sake of our unity as a people and the strength of our democracy, I offer my concession.\"\n\nStill, there have been efforts to overturn the constitutional order, notably in the \"secession winter\" of 1860-61, when seven slaveholding states, having warned that they would never accept the election of Abraham Lincoln, declared themselves in opposition to the United States itself. As Lincoln prepared for his inauguration, to be held in March, he received a series of warnings that an army raised in Virginia might invade Washington, D.C. So prevalent were the rumors of a Confederate conspiracy that Congress assembled a committee to \"inquire whether a secret organization hostile to the government of the United States exists in the District of Columbia.\" Lincoln was particularly concerned about a potential plot to undermine the counting of electors, an event scheduled for February. In the end, John Breckinridge, James Buchanan's Vice-President and a loser in the 1860 Presidential race, obeyed the law. Although Breckinridge was sympathetic to the secessionist cause, he presided with \"Roman fidelity\" at the certification vote, according to Representative Henry Dawes, of Massachusetts, \"and the nation was saved.\" But only temporarily. On April 12, 1861, the South Carolina militia opened fire on the Union garrison at Fort Sumter and the Civil War began.\n\nA civil war, in the nineteenth-century understanding of the term, is not at hand. But what makes the events of January 6, 2021, so alarming is that they were inspired and incited by the President of the United States, Donald Trump, who remains popular among so many Republicans and a contender to return to the White House.\n\nThe events of January 6th were the culmination of a long campaign that Trump and members of his circle have led against the legitimacy of American elections. The campaign's most powerful weapon was the undermining of truth itself, the insidious deployment of conspiracy theories and \"alternative facts.\"\n\nTrump first announced his emergence from the worlds of New York real estate and reality-show television by declaring that Barack Obama, the first Black President, had been born in Kenya, not Hawaii, and was, therefore, ineligible to hold office. After joining the 2016 Presidential race, Trump continued to traffic in casual accusations and unfounded conspiracy theories: Ted Cruz's father was an associate of Lee Harvey Oswald. Antonin Scalia might have been murdered. Obama and Joe Biden might have staged the killing of Osama bin Laden with a body double. Trump welcomed the endorsement of the professional conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who had earlier claimed that Hillary Clinton had \"personally murdered and chopped up and raped\" children, and that the mass murder at Sandy Hook had been \"staged.\" The most consequential conspiracy theory of Trump's political career, however, charged that American elections were rigged.\n\nIn 2016, Trump, once he had a hold on the Republican Party nomination, began the process of undermining confidence in the entire electoral system. The reporter Jonathan Lemire, in his book, \"The Big Lie,\" recalls attending a rally, in Columbus, Ohio, at which Trump told his followers, weeks before the nominating Convention, \"I'm afraid the election is going to be rigged, I have to be honest.\" On Fox News, talking with Sean Hannity, Trump again expressed his doubts: \"I hope the Republicans are watching closely, or it's going to be taken away from us.\" Trump began to warn that he was not necessarily prepared to accede to the election results. At one of the Presidential debates, the moderator, Chris Wallace, asked Trump if he would make a commitment to accept the outcome, no matter what. Trump refused: \"I will look at it at the time. What I've seen is so bad.\"\n\nClinton won the popular vote by a margin of more than two per cent, but, because she fell well short in the Electoral College, there was no compulsion on Trump's part to consider extralegal action. But four years later, as Trump lagged behind Joe Biden in the polls, he revived the theme. \"MILLIONS OF MAIL-IN BALLOTS WILL BE PRINTED BY FOREIGN COUNTRIES, AND OTHERS,\" he tweeted. \"IT WILL BE THE SCANDAL OF OUR TIMES!\" Once more, Trump refused to promise a peaceful transfer of power. A month and a half before the election, he said, \"Get rid of the ballots and you'll have a very peaceful-there won't be a transfer, frankly. There will be a continuation.\"\n\nThis kind of rhetoric was of grave concern to Democrats, including Speaker Pelosi, who privately told confidants, \"He's going to try to steal it.\" And, not long after the voting ended, the tweets from Trump began:\n\nLast night I was leading, often solidly, in many key States, in almost all instances Democrat run & controlled. Then, one by one, they started to magically disappear as surprise ballot dumps were counted. VERY STRANGE, and the pollsters got it completely & historically wrong!\n\nThey are finding Biden votes all over the place-in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. So bad for our Country!\n\nOn November 7th, the Associated Press, Fox News, and, soon, all the other major news outlets called Pennsylvania, and the election, for Biden. The battleground states-Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Arizona, and Wisconsin-all went Biden's way, and, in the end, he won 306 electoral votes to Trump's 232. In his victory speech, the President-elect said, \"It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric. To lower the temperature.\"\n\nThis was a vain hope. As the Trump White House emptied, a motley assemblage of satraps and third-raters-Giuliani; a former federal prosecutor, Sidney Powell; the MyPillow C.E.O., Mike Lindell; the former law professor and Federalist Society leader John Eastman-stayed behind to encourage Trump in his most conspiratorial fantasies and schemes. In their effort to challenge election results in various states, Trump's lawyers filed sixty-two federal and state lawsuits. They lost sixty-one of those suits, winning only on an inconsequential technical matter in Pennsylvania. By mid-December, even Mitch McConnell began referring to \"President-elect Joe Biden.\" When Trump called to berate him for conceding the ballot, McConnell, for once, stood up to him. \"The Electoral College has spoken,\" he said. \"You lost the election.\"\n\nThe only option Trump had left was to challenge the certification of the vote. With Eastman in the lead, his team concocted a plan that called on Vice-President Pence to declare that voting in seven states was still in dispute and to eliminate those electors. If the remaining forty-three states put forward their electors, Trump would win the election, 232-222. As part of that plan-what Chairman Thompson called, from the first day of the hearings, \"an attempted coup\"-Trump pressured government and election officials to coöperate. Former Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue testified that Trump did not conceal his intent, telling Donoghue, \"What I'm asking you to do is just say it was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.\" Once Trump unleashed his campaign of intimidation against local election officials, the death threats against those officials came from all directions. Ruby Freeman, an election worker in Georgia, testified, \"There is nowhere I feel safe. Nowhere. Do you know how it feels to have the President of the United States target you?\"\n\nAnother version of the plan had Pence calling for a ten-day-long recess and sending the slates back to the so-called \"disputed\" states. Eastman himself conceded that this plan would be rejected unanimously by the Supreme Court. Even so, the White House could surely be retained if Trump could convince Pence to \"do the right thing.\"\n\nOn the night of January 5th, the President met with Pence at the White House and tried to pressure him into adopting the scheme that Eastman had devised. For years, Pence had been the most loyal of deputies, never daring to challenge the falsehoods or the cruelties of his master. Trump, after all, had rescued him from political oblivion. But Pence would not go along with the plot. His job on January 6th, he told the President, was ceremonial. He was only there \"to open envelopes.\"\n\nTrump was outraged. \"You've betrayed us,\" he told Pence. \"I made you. You were nothing.\"\n\nThe committee's report is not a work of scholarship removed from its era. It was compiled by politicians and staff members and published at a moment of continuing peril and uncertainty. And the committee was formed in the contrails of the terrifying episode it was charged with investigating.\n\nAlthough an abundance of new details has surfaced, the contours of what happened have never been in doubt. The events on January 6, 2021, began with a well-planned rally on the Ellipse, the fifty-two-acre park south of the White House. Trump had tweeted in advance, \"Be there, will be wild!\" Katrina Pierson, a spokeswoman for Trump's 2016 campaign and one of the organizers of the rally, had texted another organizer saying that Trump \"likes the crazies,\" and wanted Alex Jones to be among the speakers. Jones did not speak, but Trump himself supplied the inflammatory rhetoric. In the seventy-minute-long speech he gave on the Ellipse, he told his followers they would \"save our democracy\" by rejecting \"a fake election,\" and warned them that \"if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\" He taunted his Vice-President: \"Mike Pence, I hope you're going to stand up for the good of our Constitution and for the good of our country. And if you're not, I'm going to be very disappointed in you.\" He set a tone of combativeness, defiance, and eternal resistance. And he put the life of his own Vice-President in jeopardy. As Chairman Thompson put it at one hearing, \"Donald Trump turned the mob on him.\"\n\nEven though senior officials around Trump had told him that it was long past time to step aside-William Barr informed congressional investigators that he told Trump that reports of voting fraud were \"bullshit\"-Trump refused to listen. (\"I thought, boy, if he really believes this stuff, he has, you know, lost contact with, he's become detached from reality,\" Barr recalled.) Trump was unrelenting. \"We will never give up,\" he told the crowd on the Ellipse. \"We will never concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's theft involved. Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore.\" After listening to the President's repeated calls to fight, and to march to the Capitol building-\"you'll never take back our country with weakness\"-thousands of his followers, some of them armed, some of them carrying Confederate symbols, some deploying flagpoles as spears, headed toward Capitol Hill.\n\nAs the march began, at around 1 p.m. , Representative Paul Gosar, of Arizona, and Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, both conservative Republicans, rose in Congress to object to the counting of the electoral ballots from Arizona. But Pence had already told Trump he would not go along with his plot, and there was no sign that Gosar, Cruz, and Trump's loyalists in Congress had the numbers to succeed. McConnell, at that time the Senate Majority Leader, said, \"Voters, the courts, and the states have all spoken-they've all spoken. If we overrule them all, it would damage our republic forever.\"\n\nBy 2 p.m. , demonstrators began to overrun the Capitol Police, sometimes using improvised weapons. Caroline Edwards, of the Capitol Police, testified to the committee that there was \"carnage\" in the halls: \"I was slipping in people's blood.\" The insurrectionists kept coming, breaking through windows and doors, assaulting police officers, and, once inside, they went hunting for the Vice-President, the Speaker of the House, and other officials who refused to participate in the President's scheme to overturn the election. At around 2:20 p.m. , the Senate, and then the House, went into emergency recess, as Capitol Police officers rushed members of both chambers to safety. The two Democratic congressional leaders, Nancy Pelosi and Charles Schumer, fearing for their lives and the lives of their colleagues, were reduced to sequestering in a safe location. In the final session of the committee's investigation, we saw footage of Pelosi, enraged yet composed, deploying her cell phone to get someone to come to the aid of the legislative branch.\n\nTrump watched these events on television at the White House with scant sense of alarm. He refused to send additional police or troops to quell the violence. At 2:24 p.m. , he tweeted, \"Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution.\" By 3 p.m. , insurrectionists, some of them in cosplay battle gear, had swarmed into the Senate chamber. Trump's passivity was not passivity at all. As Adam Kinzinger put it, \"President Trump did not fail to act. He chose not to act.\" Liz Cheney was no less blunt. \"He refused to defend our nation and our Constitution,\" she said during the hearings. \"I say this to my Republican colleagues who are   defending the indefensible, there will come a day when Donald Trump is gone. But your dishonor will remain.\"\n\nFor Trump, the choice was simple. The insurrectionists were his people, his shock troops, there to do his bidding. Nothing about the spectacle seemed to disturb him: not the gallows erected outside the building, not the savage beatings, not threats to Pence and Pelosi, not graffiti like \"Murder the Media,\" not the chants of \"1776! 1776!\" And so he ignored calls to action even from his own party. At 3:11 p.m. , Mike Gallagher, a Republican from Wisconsin, tweeted, \"We are witnessing absolute banana republic crap in the United States Capitol right now. @realdonaldtrump you need to call this off.\" Trump would not tell his supporters to go home until the early evening, when the damage had been done.\n\nAnd though Trump and the insurrectionists failed to halt the certification of the ballot, they did get substantial support: a hundred and forty-seven Republicans in Congress voted to overturn the election results. At 3:42 a.m. on January 7th, Vice-President Pence, speaking to a joint session of Congress, certified the election of Joe Biden as the forty-sixth President of the United States. When, however, the midterms were held, two years later, dozens of Republican candidates continued to claim that his election was fraudulent. Those few Republicans, like Liz Cheney, who took a stand against Trump were swept out of office.\n\nJanuary 6th was a phenomenon rooted both in the degraded era of Trump and in the radicalization of a major political party during the past generation. The very power of these developments explains why many people may approach this congressional report with a sense of fatigue, even denial. Part of Trump's dark achievement has been to bludgeon the political attention of the country into submission.\n\nWhen a nation has been subjected to that degree of cynicism-what is politely called \"divisiveness\"-it can lose its ability to experience outrage. As a result, the prospect of engaging with this congressional inquiry into Trump's attempt to delegitimatize the machinery of electoral democracy is sometimes a challenge to the spirit. That is both understandable and a public danger. And yet a citizenry that can no longer bring itself to pay attention to such an investigation or to absorb its astonishing findings risks moving even farther toward a disturbing \"new normal\": a post-truth, post-democratic America.\n\nA republic is predicated on faith-not religious faith but a faith in the fundamental legitimacy of its political institutions and the decisions they issue. To concede the legitimacy of statutes, rulings, and election returns is not necessarily to favor them. It's simply to participate in the basic system that gives them form and force; citizens can, through democratic machinery, seek to defeat or contest candidates they deplore, initiatives that offend them, court opinions they consider misguided. By contrast, the campaign that culminated in the Capitol attack of January 6th was, fatefully, against democracy itself. It sought to instill profound mistrust in the process of voting-the mechanism through which, even in highly imperfect democracies, accountability is ultimately secured.\n\nThe committee and its work were far from apolitical, and yet to dismiss the report as merely political would be a perilous act of resignation and defeatism. The questions that hovered over the inquiry from the start-what more is there to learn? who is really listening?-persisted and loomed over the midterm elections. When the hearings began, the polling outfit FiveThirtyEight reported that Trump's approval rating was 41.9 per cent; when the hearings ended, it was 40.4 per cent, a minuscule dip. As Susan B. Glasser, of The New Yorker , wrote, \"All that damning evidence, and the polls were basically unchanged. The straight line in the former President's approval rating is the literal representation of the crisis in American democracy. There is an essentially immovable forty per cent of the country whose loyalty to Donald Trump cannot be shaken by anything.\" And yet the Republicans failed in their promise to produce a \"red wave\" in the midterms. The Democrats maintained their slender hold on the Senate and lost far fewer seats in the House than was expected. And while the reasons behind the Republican failure were many, ranging from the imperilment of abortion rights to the dismal quality of so many of the Party's candidates, it was clear that one of the principal reasons was a deep concern about the future of democracy.\n\nThe most urgent thing to learn is whether a two-and-a-half-century-old republic will resist future efforts to undercut its foundations-to steal, through concerted deception, the essential legitimacy of its constitutional order. The contents of the report insist that complacency is not an option. The report also insists on accountability, though that will ultimately be the responsibility of the Department of Justice and the American public. The report has provided the evidence, the truth. Now it remains to be seen if it will be acted upon.\n\nThe violation of January 6th was ultimately so brazen that many of Trump's own loyalists could not, in the end, bring themselves to defend him. Even some on the radical right have come to recognize the insurrection's implications for the future. Jason van Tatenhove was once the media spokesman for the militia group known as the Oath Keepers, which played a crucial role in the uprising. He left the group well before January 6th, but he remained well connected enough to know that the Oath Keepers were eager to take part in an \"armed revolution.\" Testifying before the committee, he expressed his sense of betrayal by Donald Trump, and a growing sense of alarm: \"If a President that's willing to try to instill and encourage, to whip up, a civil war among his followers uses lies and deceit and snake oil, regardless of the human impact, what else is he going to do?\"\n\nTrump is running again for President. Perhaps his decline is irreversible. But it would be foolish to count on that. Should he win back the White House, he will come to office with no sense of restraint. He will inevitably be an even more radical, more resentful, more chaotic, more authoritarian version of his earlier self. And he would hardly be an isolated figure in the capital. Following the results of the midterm elections, Congress is now populated with dozens of election deniers and many more who still dare not defy Trump. The stakes could not be higher. If you are reaching for optimism-and despair is not an option-the existence and the depth of the committee's project represents a kind of hope. It represents an insistence on truth and democratic principle. In the words of the man who tried and failed to overturn a Presidential election, you don't concede when there's theft involved. ♦\n\nWhen the Capitol was breached, a New Yorker reporter became the sole journalist in the Senate chamber to witness its desecration .\n\nInside the chamber, Luke Mogelson captured raw, visceral footage of the siege .\n\nShould Americans refer to the Sixth of January as a protest, an act of treason, or something else ?\n\nWhat the January 6th papers reveal .\n\nHow a mother of eight became one of the riot's biggest mysteries, and a fugitive from the F.B.I.\n\nThe violence was what Donald Trump wanted .\n\nIf America is to remain a democracy, Trump must be held accountable .\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker .\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "What the January 6th Report Is Missing\n\nTrump is going to do some crazy shit.\n\n-Steve Bannon, October 31, 2020\n\nThe Government Publishing Office's eight-hundred-and-forty-five-page report of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol is divided into eight chapters, makes eleven recommendations, attaches four appendices, and includes four thousand two hundred and eighty-five endnotes. Its executive summary, which at nearly two hundred pages can hardly be called a summary, provides a numbered list of seventeen key findings, the first eleven of which have, as the subject of the predicate, the forty-fifth President of the United States:\n\n1. Donald Trump purposely disseminated false allegations of fraud. . . .\n\n2. Donald Trump refused to accept the lawful result of the 2020 election. . . .\n\n3. Donald Trump corruptly pressured Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes. . . .\n\n4. Donald Trump sought to corrupt the U.S. Department of Justice. . . .\n\n5. Donald Trump unlawfully pressured State officials and legislators. . . .\n\n6. Donald Trump oversaw an effort to transmit false electoral certificates. . . .\n\n7. Donald Trump pressured Members of Congress to object to valid slates of electors. . . .\n\n8. Donald Trump purposely verified false information filed in Federal court. . . .\n\n9. Donald Trump summoned tens of thousands of supporters to Washington for January 6th. . . .\n\n10. Donald Trump purposely sent a social media message publicly condemning Vice President Pence. . . .\n\n11. Donald Trump refused repeated requests over a multiple hour period that he instruct his violent supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol. . . .\n\nIn a foreword to the report, Bennie G. Thompson, the committee's chairman, stresses the importance of \"accountability at all levels,\" but although the word \"conspiracy\" appears both in finding No. 12-\"Each of these actions by Donald Trump was taken in support of a multi-part conspiracy to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 Presidential election\"-and more than a hundred times elsewhere in the document, the report is less an account of a conspiracy than a very long bill of indictment against a single man.\n\nRead David Remnick on the House select committee's devastating findings.\n\nTwo years ago, the President of the United States attempted to overturn an election for no reason other than that he had lost. A mere handful of Republican officeholders denounced him; for months, nationally prominent members of the G.O.P. refused to acknowledge that Joseph Biden had won the Presidency. On January 6, 2021, at Trump's urging, thousands of his supporters staged an armed, lethal, and yet somehow also inane insurrection at the Capitol , aimed at preventing a joint session of Congress from certifying the results of the election. They failed. Unless you count being temporarily banned from Twitter as punishment, the former President has suffered no consequences for his actions; Republicans have refused to hold him to account, not least because many Party leaders have been implicated in the attempted overthrow of the United States government. Days after the insurrection, the House voted to impeach the President, but the Senate then failed to convict him. Months later, the House voted to establish an independent, 9/11-style commission to investigate the insurrection, but the Senate blocked that by way of the filibuster. The House soon voted to hold its own investigation , under the aegis of a select committee composed of seven Democrats and six Republicans. Then Nancy Pelosi , the Democratic Speaker of the House, refused to seat on the committee two Republicans who had supported the insurrection, whereupon Kevin McCarthy , the Republican Minority Leader, denounced the committee and pulled his members from it, after which the G.O.P., declaring the attack on the Capitol to have been \"legitimate political discourse,\" censured the two Republicans who did serve on the committee, Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, both of whom left office this month. (Cheney lost her bid for reëlection, and Kinzinger declined to run.)\n\nCongress established the January 6th Committee on June 30, 2021. The committee's report is the fullest record yet of the conspiracy to overturn the results of the 2020 Presidential election , much of it deriving from the dauntless work of earlier reporters, much of it newly gathered by the committee itself. In the course of eighteen months, the committee reviewed thousands of pages of evidence and presented testimony from more than seventy witnesses during ten televised hearings produced with the aid of the former president of ABC News and illustrated with taped video interviews, Facebook posts, text messages, YouTube clips, and surveillance footage, all of it easily snipped and posted on social media. The hearings made for great television and, probably more important, great memes, the TikTokification of testimony. \"Like our hearings, this report is designed to deliver our findings in detail in a format that is accessible for all Americans,\" Liz Cheney, the committee's vice-chair, writes in a foreword to the written report. But the report, unlike the hearings, is dreary, repetitive, and exhausting. In that sense, it's like Trump himself. It's also surprisingly scanty in the key elements of storytelling-setting, character, and plot. It's as if the committee found itself unable to surmount Trump's madness and senselessness, trapped in his very plotlessness.\n\nThe report doesn't lack for details, which consist mainly of running down and debunking bogus claims about dead voters, shredded ballots, dumped votes, voting machines linked to Hugo Chávez, a faked water-main rupture, suitcases full of ballots, U.S.B. drives, truckloads of ballots in garbage bins, unmarked vans, a Dominion voting machine connected to China by way of a smart thermostat, and some guy meddling with the election from inside a prison in Italy. There are inconsequential but \"Veep\"-worthy revelations: an Oath Keeper calling followers of QAnon \"Q-tards,\" and Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, at the rally at the Ellipse on January 6th, asked whether he would march to the Capitol, answering, \"Hell, no. It's freezing.\" Antics abound: Rudy Giuliani (who is now facing disbarment) holding a press conference at Four Seasons Total Landscaping; Ivanka and Jared fretting, uselessly; a Proud Boys subcommittee calling itself the Ministry of Self-Defense entertaining a proposal from South Florida cryptocurrency investors that refers to the planned attack on the Capitol as operation Storm the Winter Palace, a reference to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution (leading the report's authors to huff, \"No historical event has been less American\"). At one point, Trump supporters in Michigan plan to hide out in the state's capitol overnight, so that, in the morning, they can sign an elector certificate that, by law, has to be signed in that building. Not for nothing did William Barr, the Attorney General at the time, refer to Trump's legal team as the \"clown car.\" It's all so madcap and vaudevillian that, if the stakes weren't so high, and the matter at hand not so grave, it would be the Marx Brothers in \"Night at the White House.\"\n\nBut the stakes are high; they tower. Trump might get reëlected. Or he might get indicted. Both could happen. Even if he were to die tomorrow, the attempt to overturn the election would require an accounting of its deeper roots in American political behavior and discourse, of the anti-government takeover of the G.O.P., and of the role played by the hundred and forty-seven Republicans who, in the early morning of January 7, 2021, only hours after the Capitol had been cleared of rioters, voted against certifying the results of the election. The siege of the building is, in the end, the least of it. The Department of Justice has so far filed criminal charges against more than nine hundred people who participated in the insurrection, of whom nearly five hundred have either pleaded guilty or been convicted. The January 6th Report makes eight criminal referrals, recommending that the Department of Justice prosecute the former President (and in some cases other people) for crimes that include obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and incitement or assistance of insurrection, the charge for which Trump was impeached in January, 2021. Much turns on the reception of this report. As a brief for the prosecution, it's a start. As a book, it's essential if miserable reading. As history, it's a shambles.\n\nInvestigatory committees and commissions began to multiply about a century ago, with the rise of the administrative state and the extension of executive power. Their purpose is chiefly to hold bureaucrats and elected officials and, especially, the executive branch accountable for wrongdoing. It wasn't clear, at first, whether these commissions were constitutional. That question was resolved in 1927, when, in McGrain v. Daugherty, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a conviction for contempt of the brother of the Attorney General, who had refused to appear before a Senate committee investigating the Teapot Dome scandal. The investigatory commission proliferated during the Progressive Era, and has origins in \"race riot\" commissions like the Chicago Commission on Race Relations, established in 1919 by the governor of Illinois \"to get the facts and interpret them and to find a way out,\" or, as Lyndon B. Johnson put it, when charging the Kerner Commission with investigating \"civil disorders\" half a century later, \"What happened? Why did it happen? What can be done to prevent it from happening again and again?\"\n\nThese same questions animate the January 6th investigation, and a case can be made that the insurrection was, among other things, a race riot -a white race riot. But the committee has not taken as its model the race-riot report. Instead, the report is indebted to earlier investigations into attacks on the United States, a kinship suggested by the committee's preference for the word \"attack\" over the word \"insurrection,\" as if it came from without. \"I don't know if you want to use the word 'insurrection,' 'coup,' whatever,\" a White House staffer told the committee. The committee knew which word it wanted to use.\n\nCongress ordered the select committee to \"investigate and report upon the facts, circumstances, and causes\" of the attack on the Capitol. The charge borrows its language from investigations into earlier attacks on the United States. On December 18, 1941, eleven days after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, F.D.R. appointed a commission \"to ascertain and report the facts relating to the attack.\" In 1963, after John F. Kennedy was assassinated, Lyndon B. Johnson directed the Warren Commission \"to evaluate all the facts and circumstances surrounding the assassination,\" which, at the time, many suspected to have been a covert operation coördinated by the K.G.B., given that Lee Harvey Oswald had defected to the Soviet Union in 1959. In 2002, Congress charged the 9/11 Commission with determining the \"facts and circumstances relating to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\" Each investigated failures within the federal government, especially failures of intelligence, but each looked, too, to foreign actors.\n\nIf you're going to report on the facts, circumstances, and causes of an event, the natural way to do it is to write a story that is both painstakingly researched and kept kissing-close to the evidence-a story, in other words, that is also a history. A history has to be true, to the best of your knowledge at the time of the writing, and it ought to be riveting. The Warren Commission Report (1964) reads like a mystery novel: \"In the corner house itself, Mrs. Barbara Jeanette Davis and her sister-in-law, Mrs. Virginia Davis, heard the shots and rushed to the door in time to see the man walk rapidly across the lawn shaking a revolver as if he were emptying it of cartridge cases.\" The Starr Report (1998), an investigation of a real-estate deal that ended up exposing Bill Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, often reads like porn: \"In the course of flirting with him, she raised her jacket in the back and showed him the straps of her thong underwear, which extended above her pants.\" The 9/11 Commission Report (2004) reads like an international thriller: \"Tuesday, September 11, 2001, dawned temperate and nearly cloudless in the eastern United States. . . . In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run. For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine.\" The January 6th Report reads like a prosecuting attorney's statement to a jury: \"President Trump's decision to declare victory falsely on election night and, unlawfully, to call for the vote counting to stop, was not a spontaneous decision. It was premeditated.\" A page-turner it is not.\n\nThe reports of earlier investigatory commissions have been mixed successes. The Warren Report, which concluded that Oswald acted alone, is notorious, since it did little to halt the flowering of conspiracy theories involving everything from the Mafia to Martians. \"We are looking to you, not to approve our own notions, but to guide us and to guide the country through a thicket of tension, conflicting evidence, and extreme opinion,\" L.B.J. told the Kerner Commission. But, when the report came in, the President refused even to accept a copy. The Starr Report is just plain embarrassing.\n\nReports of investigatory commissions don't age well: as is the case with all historical analysis, more evidence always comes out later. Still, some reports are better than others. The 9/11 Commission Report was a finalist for the National Book Award. In an \"authorized\" edition published by W. W. Norton, the report was also an unexpected best-seller. As with the January 6th Report, which is available from several different publishers as a book- including an edition co-published by this magazine -you could get the 9/11 report free online, but people bought it anyway. Time described it as \"one of the most riveting, disturbing and revealing accounts of crime, espionage and the inner workings of government ever written.\" The Times Book Review called it \"an improbable literary triumph.\"\n\nFamilies of the victims, not members of Congress, had demanded the formation of the 9/11 Commission, which consisted of five Democrats and five Republicans (none of whom were current members of Congress). The architects of the report were two professors of history-the commission's executive director, Philip D. Zelikow, and a senior adviser, Ernest R. May-who had taught courses together and had also collaborated on a book, \"The Kennedy Tapes.\" May, a Harvard professor (and a colleague of mine until his death, in 2009), wanted to reinvent the genre. \"Typically, government reports focus on 'findings' and array the evidence accordingly,\" he explained. \"None, to our knowledge, had ever attempted simply to produce professional-quality narrative history.\" This is what May set out to do-he wanted to create \"enduringly readable history\"-and it's not only the report's narrative structure but also its sense of historical time that endows it with both immediacy and lastingness.\n\nThe historical narrative is the first eleven chapters of a thirteen-chapter report. There is no two-hundred-page executive summary. There is no executive summary at all, or any list of findings. There is, instead, a taut, three-page preface, and then the story begins, the \"story of eccentric and violent ideas sprouting in the fertile ground of political and social turmoil.\"\n\nThe 9/11 report has plenty of flaws, as May was the first to admit. \"For one thing, the report skirts the question of whether American policies and actions fed the anger that manifested itself on September 11,\" he wrote in The New Republic in 2005 . For another, because some members of the commission and its staff had worked at national-security agencies, \"collective drafting led to the introduction of passages that offset criticism of an agency with words of praise. Not all these words were deserved.\" Both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush got off even easier than the C.I.A., the F.B.I., and the N.S.A. What May was hinting at is illustrated in a thirty-one-page document declassified only this fall, a \"memorandum for the record\" of a meeting between Bush and the commissioners in which the commissioners repeatedly pressed Bush on whether he knew, in the summer of 2001, about the threat posed by Al Qaeda. Bush said he'd been briefed only about \"threats overseas.\" This was a lie. He'd been warned about specific threats to the United States. Nowhere in the commission's final report-released in July, 2004, less than four months before a Presidential election-is the President implicated. If he had been, he might not have been reëlected. \"Our aim has not been to assign individual blame,\" reads the preface, written by the bipartisan commission's co-chairs. Instead, they hoped to provide an explanation.\n\nMay wanted the 9/11 report to \"transcend the passions of the moment,\" and it did. He hoped it might serve as a model for future reports. \"In these perilous times, there will surely be other events that will require the principles of historiography allied to the resources of government, so that urgency will sometimes become the friend of truth.\" This is the bar that was set for members of the January 6th Committee. Their report does not clear that bar. Not because the report isn't accurate but because it hasn't achieved escape velocity from the leaden passions of the present.\n\nHere, radically reduced-forty gallons of sap to one gallon of maple syrup-is a very un-executive summary of the report. Donald Trump never said he'd abide by the outcome of the election. In May of 2020, fearing that Biden might win in November, he tweeted, \"It will be the greatest Rigged Election in history!\" He understood that he would likely lose but that, owing to an effect known as the Red Mirage, it would look, for a while, as if he had won: more Democrats than Republicans would vote by mail and, since mail-in ballots are often the last to be counted, early counting would favor Republicans. \"When that happens,\" Roger Stone advised him, \"the key thing to do is to claim victory. . . . No, we won. Fuck you, Sorry. Over.\"\n\nThat was Plan A. In September, The Atlantic published a bombshell article by Barton Gellman reporting that the Trump campaign had a scheme \"to bypass election results and appoint loyal electors in battleground states where Republicans hold the legislative majority.\" That was Plan B. Plan A (\"Fuck you\") was more Trump's style. \"He's gonna declare victory,\" Steve Bannon said. \"But that doesn't mean he's the winner. He's just gonna say he's a winner.\" On Election Night, November 3rd, Trump wanted to do just that, but his campaign team persuaded him not to. His patience didn't last long. \"This is a fraud on the American public,\" Trump said on November 4th. \"We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election.\" The next day, he tweeted, \" STOP THE COUNT! \" On November 7th, CNN, NBC, MSNBC, ABC, the Associated Press, and Fox News all declared that Joseph Biden had won. The election was not close. Counting the votes just took a while.\n\nAfter Biden won, Trump continued to insist that widespread fraud had been committed. Bill Stepien, Trump's campaign manager, told the January 6th Committee that the campaign became a \"truth telling squad,\" chasing allegations, discovering them to be unfounded, and telling the President, \"Yeah, that wasn't true.\" The Department of Homeland Security looked into allegations, most of which popped up online, and announced, \"There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.\" The Justice Department, too, investigated charges of fraud, but, as Barr informed the committee, he was left telling the President, repeatedly, \"They're not panning out.\"\n\nFor Plan C, the President turned to Rudy Giuliani and a group of lawyers that included Sidney Powell. They filed sixty-two lawsuits challenging election results, and lost all but one of these suits (and that one involved neither allegations of fraud nor any significant number of votes). Twenty-two of the judges who decided these cases had been appointed by Republicans, and ten had been appointed by Trump.\n\nOn December 11th, the Supreme Court rejected a suit that had challenged the results in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Trump had had every right to challenge the results of state elections, but at this point he had exhausted his legal options. He decided to fall back on Plan B, the fake-electors plan, which required hundreds of legislators across the country to set aside the popular vote in states won by Biden, claiming that the results were fraudulent, and appointing their own slate of electors, who would cast their Electoral College votes for Trump on December 14th. According to Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to Trump's chief of staff, Mark Meadows, the White House counsel determined that, since none of the fraud allegations had been upheld by any court, the fake-electors plan was illegal. But one deputy assistant to the President told Trump that it didn't matter whether there had been fraud or not, because \"state legislators 'have the constitutional right to substitute their judgment for a certified majority of their constituents' if that prevents socialism.\"\n\nPlan B required Trump to put pressure on a lot of people. The committee counted at least two hundred attempts he made to influence state or local officials by phone, text, posts, or public remarks. Instructing Trump supporters to join in, Giuliani said, \"Sometimes it even requires being threatened.\" A Trump-campaign spreadsheet documents efforts to contact more than a hundred and ninety Republican state legislators in Arizona, Georgia, and Michigan alone.\n\nBarr resigned. \"I didn't want to be part of it,\" he told the committee. Plenty of other people were happy to be part of it, though. Ronna McDaniel, the R.N.C. chair, participated and provided Trump with the assistance of R.N.C. staffers. On December 14th, certified electors met in every state. In seven states that Biden had won-Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin-fake electors also met and produced counterfeit Electoral College certificates for Trump. Five of these certificates were sent to Washington but were rejected because they lacked the required state seal; two arrived after the deadline. None were accepted.\n\nTrump then launched Plan D, which was not so much a plan as a pig's breakfast of a conspiracy, a coup, and a putsch. Everything turned on January 6th, the day a joint session of Congress was to certify the results of the Electoral College vote. To stop that from happening, Trump recruited members of Congress into a conspiracy to overturn the election by rejecting the certified votes and accepting the counterfeits; he asked the Vice-President to participate in a coup by simply declaring him the winner; and he incited his supporters to take over the Capitol by force, in a poorly planned putsch, which he intended to lead. On December 17th, Kayleigh McEnany said on Fox News, \"There has been an alternate slate of electors voted upon that Congress will decide in January.\" Two days later, Trump tweeted, \"Big protest in D.C. On January 6th. Be there, will be wild.\" The legal architect of the Pence part of the pig's breakfast-\"a coup in search of a legal theory,\" as one federal judge called it-was a lawyer named John Eastman. The Trump lawyer Eric Herschmann recalled a conversation he had with Eastman:\n\nYou're saying you believe the Vice President, acting as President of the Senate, can be the sole decisionmaker as to, under your theory, who becomes the next President of the United States? And he said, yes. And I said, are you out of your Fing mind?\n\nTrump pressed the acting Attorney General, Jeffrey Rosen, and other members of the Department of Justice to aid the conspiracy by declaring some of the voting to have been fraudulent. Rosen refused. \"The D.O.J. can't and won't snap its fingers and change the outcome of the election,\" he told Trump. Trump replied, \"I don't expect you to do that. Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican Congressmen.\" Trump tried to replace Rosen with a lackey named Jeffrey Clark, but, in a tense meeting at the White House on January 3rd, Rosen and others made clear to him that, if he did so, much of the department would resign. Trump and Eastman met repeatedly with Pence in the Oval Office and tried to recruit him into the conspiracy. Pence refused. At 11:20 a.m. on January 6th, Trump called Pence and again asked him, and again Pence refused, after which, according to Ivanka, the President called the Vice-President a pussy.\n\nTrump was slated to speak at his be-wild rally at the Ellipse at noon, but when he arrived he was unhappy about the size of the crowd. The Secret Service had set up magnetometers, known as mags, to screen for weapons. Twenty-eight thousand people went through the mags, from whom the Secret Service collected, among other banned items, \"269 knives or blades, 242 cannisters of pepper spray, 18 brass knuckles, 18 tasers, 6 pieces of body armor, 3 gas masks, 30 batons or blunt instruments.\" Some people had ditched their bags, and presumably their weapons, in trees or cars. In a crowd that included members of white-supremacist and far-right, anti-government extremist groups-including the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers, America First, and QAnon-another twenty-five thousand people simply refused to go through the mags. \"I don't fucking care that they have weapons,\" Trump shouted. \"They're not here to hurt me . Take the fucking mags away.\" The mags stayed. Trump took to the podium and fired up his followers for the march to the Capitol until 1:10 P.M., and then he walked to his motorcade, climbed into the Presidential S.U.V., which is known as the Beast, and demanded to be driven to the Capitol. Secret Service agents persuaded him to return to the White House.\n\nJust before the Joint Session was to begin, at one o'clock, Pence released a written statement: \"I do not believe that the Founders of our country intended to invest the Vice President with unilateral authority to decide which electoral votes should be counted during the Joint Session of Congress.\" The voting began. By 1:21, Trump had been informed that the Capitol was under attack. He spent the rest of the day watching it on television. For hours, his staff and his advisers begged him to order the mob to disperse or to call for military assistance; he refused. At 1:46, Representative Paul Gosar objected to the count from Arizona, after which Senator Ted Cruz endorsed that objection. Pence was evacuated at 2:12. Seconds later, Proud Boys achieved the first breach of the Capitol, smashing a window in the Senate wing. Eleven minutes later, the mob broke through the doors to the East Rotunda, and Trump tweeted, \"Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done.\" The mob chanted, \"Hang Mike Pence.\" Meadows told a colleague, \"He thinks Mike deserves it.\" Kevin McCarthy called the President. \"They literally just came through my office windows,\" he said. \"You need to call them off.\" Trump said, \"Well, Kevin, I guess they're just more upset about the election theft than you are.\" At 4:17 P . M ., the President released a video message in which he asked the insurrectionists to go home, and told them that he loved them.\n\nAnd that, in brief, is the report, which concludes that \"the central cause of January 6th was one man, former President Donald Trump.\" And that, in brief, is the problem: chasing Trump, never quite untethering itself from him, fluttering in the biting wind of his violent derangement, like a ribbon pinned to the tail of a kite during a tornado, and failing, entirely, to see the tornado.\n\nIn the January 6th Report, Donald Trump acted alone and came out of nowhere. He has no past. Neither does the nation. The rest of the country doesn't even exist. No one dies of Covid , no one loses a job, no one sinks to her knees in grief upon hearing on the radio the news that Americans- Americans -are staging an armed invasion of the Capitol. Among the many reasons this investigation ought to have been conducted by a body independent from the federal government is that there is very little suffering in Congress's January 6th Report, except that of members of Congress running for their lives that day.\n\nThe report is organized around the idea of the \"Big Lie,\" which is the title of the report's first chapter. \"The Big Lie\" is what Democratic politicians and many journalists call Trump's claim that he had won the election. (It is also an expression first notably used by Adolf Hitler.) It is an inept phrase: it turns an attempted coup d'état into something that sounds like a children's book written by Margaret Wise Brown. \"The Big Lie\" is so ham-handed that, unsurprisingly, it's an expression that Trump adores. \"The Fraudulent Presidential Election of 2020 will be, from this day forth, known as THE BIG LIE !\" he announced at one point. Playing \"You lie!\" \"No, you lie!\" with Donald Trump is a fool's game.\n\n\"The Big Lie\" is not a big lie. It is an elaborate fiction, an artful story, with heroes and villains, exotic locales, and a sinister plot. The election was stolen by a cabal of Democrats, socialists, immigrants, criminals, Black people, and spies . This story is vicious and idiotic, and none of it is true, but it is not a Big Lie devised by an orange-haired supervillain born rich in 1946: it is the latest chapter in a fictive counter-history of the United States which has been told by the far right for decades and decades and wretched decades. In 2020, it gained so much speed so fast that it acted something like a stampede. Unfortunately, reading the report is like being in the stampede. \"The stolen election narrative has proven to be remarkably durable precisely because it is a matter of belief-not evidence, or reason,\" the report states. It does not ask why this should be. Why believe? Two in five Americans and three in five Republicans still believe. Republicans who most fiercely believe hold the Party by the throat. The 9/11 Commission Report asked, \"How did Bin Ladin-with his call for indiscriminate killing of Americans-win thousands of followers and some degree of approval from millions more?\" The January 6th Committee Report, for all its weight and consequence, never asks why anyone believed Donald Trump, which is why it is unlikely to persuade anyone not to.\n\nWhy believe? Answering that question would have required a historical vantage on the decay of the party system, the celebration of political intolerance by both the right and the left, the contribution of social media to political extremism, and the predicament of American journalism. Calling the system rigged when you're losing is an old trick. At the end of the Cold War, American zealots turned their most ruthless ideological weapons on one another, Manicheans all. In 1992, Newt Gingrich told Republican candidates to get the message out that the Democrats were going to rig the Presidential election. It didn't matter to Gingrich that this wasn't true. \"They're going to buy registrations, they're going to buy votes,\" he warned. \"They're going to turn out votes, they're going to steal votes, they're going to do anything they can.\" After the contested Bush v. Gore election, of 2000, sowing doubt about elections became common practice for outsiders in both parties. \"The system is rigged\" was the watchword of Bernie Sanders's 2016 campaign: primaries rigged against challengers, the economy rigged against working people. Suspecting that things like elections might be rigged, even when that's not true, isn't a crazy conspiracy theory; it is a political product routinely sold to voters in every city and state in the country.\n\nWhy believe? In the past two decades, public approval of Congress has fallen from eighty per cent to twenty per cent. Might it be that Congress has lost any real grip on the American experience, and no longer speaks for a nation and a people that Richard Hofstadter once called a \"huge, inarticulate beast\"? The report lacks not only a sense of the past but also a meaningful sense of the present. A chronicle that runs from April, 2020, to January, 2021, it is a story told out of time. The \"facts, circumstances, and causes\" relating to the insurrection that it fails to investigate and, in most cases, even to note, include Covid -19 deaths, masks, lockdowns, joblessness, farm closures, guns and mass shootings, a national mental-health crisis, daily reports of devastating storms and fires, George Floyd, Black Lives Matter, and partisan, and especially congressional, eye-gouging over each and every one of the items in this list. Why believe? Was the election stolen? No. But was 2020 painful? Yes.\n\nWhy believe? Nowhere acknowledged in the report is the fact that November 3, 2020, really was a weird Election Day. In the middle of a pandemic, unprecedented numbers of people voted by mail and by absentee ballot, and, even if you trudged out to the polls, you were met with the general misery of masks and loneliness and loss and, for many people, a sense of impending doom. For the entire stretch of time chronicled in this report, it felt to many Americans, not always for the same reasons, as though a great deal was being stolen from them: their jobs, their co-workers, a sense of justice and fairness in the world, predictable weather, the idea of America, the people they love, human touch. The January 6th Report offers no shuddering sense, not even a little shiver, of the national mood of vulnerability, fear, and sorrow. \"The assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy on November 22, 1963, was a cruel and shocking act of violence directed against a man, a family, a nation, and against all mankind,\" the Warren Commission Report opens. Nothing in the January 6th report is stated so squarely.\n\nWhy believe? During the pandemic, more people spent more time online than ever before. The report fails to examine the way in which Facebook and Twitter profited by spreading misinformation about the election, providing the organizational architecture for the insurrection, and making possible the doxing and harassment of courageous and dedicated public servants who refused to participate in the conspiracy. When Trump staffers tell him that allegations of fraud are unfounded, he replies, \"You guys may not be following the internet the way I do.\" Nor did the committee.\n\nWhy believe? Every single television and news outlet that reported live on Election Day, 2020, knew about the Red Mirage, and although some news anchors regularly pointed out that the outcome would not be known for days, they were nevertheless complicit in promoting the fiction of a Trump victory: simply by reporting, second by second, on November 3, 2020, they endorsed the idea that the outcome could be known that night even though they knew it to be untrue. The committee does not remark on this. Nor does it indict the media-run polls and horse-race coverage-vastly greater in number, speed, and influence than ever before, or the growing partisanship of the press. Nor does it inquire into the consequences of an educated national élite of politicians, journalists, and academics increasingly living their lives in a Met Gala to Davos to White House Correspondents' Dinner world, or the degree to which so many of them appear to have so wholly given themselves over to Twitter-knowing the world through it, reporting from it, being ruled by it.\n\nWhy believe? The answer to that question-the knowledge of what has happened to America-will have to wait for another day. From beneath the Capitol dome, the January 6th Committee has issued its report. It blames Trump. It explains very little. Outside, the whirling wind heaves and twists and roars. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Who Was Willing to Stand with Donald Trump?\n\nThe chair of the January 6th committee, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, was born into segregation in the Delta town of Bolton, Mississippi, population five hundred and twenty-one, \"a part of the country where people justify the actions of slavery, Ku Klux Klan, and lynching,\" as he said during the first hearing . The vice-chair, Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, is twenty years younger and the daughter of Vice-President Dick Cheney ; she had spent most of the Trump years occupying the third-ranking position in the Republican House leadership, until she was forced to step down in May, 2021, having repeatedly criticized Trump and voted for his impeachment. The scene is straight out of a John Grisham thriller: the slow-speaking Southern judge with a long historical memory, the sharp female prosecutor who is turning against her former political patrons. This is what justice-simple, crowd-pleasing justice-is supposed to look like.\n\nIn its focus on the period between the Presidential election on November 3, 2020, and the attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021, the committee has built an account in which successive advisers to the President-each of them representing a portion of his party-turn away from him in disgust, as he tries to sell the badly organized fiction of a stolen election . Those with him on November 3, 2020 were already a self-selecting group of loyalists, given how much of the Party refused to work for Trump in the first place, and how many of his early aides burned out and left. In November, most of the Trump White House lawyers and campaign staff, who saw no major fraud in the election, had consolidated around \"Team Normal,\" as the political aide Bill Stepien termed it in his testimony; the Trump camp was arranged around \"Team Rudy,\" a few lawyers allied with the former New York mayor Giuliani , who were searching for evidence of fraud that never turned out to be there. In every scene recreated in the hearing room, every heated Oval Office session recounted by a lawyer, every memo highlighted and projected on a screen above the dais, the central question is: Who was with Trump, and who was against him?\n\nBut this alignment had a political valence as well. In December, as Trump continued to pursue his election-fraud claims, his Attorney General, Bill Barr , the embodiment of the conservative legal establishment's truce with the President, resigned. In Congress, the Republicans clearly with Trump were the members of the right-wing House Freedom Caucus-most prominently, Rep. Jim Jordan, of Ohio, Rep. Paul Gosar, of Arizona, Rep. Louie Gohmert, of Texas, and Rep. Scott Perry, of Pennsylvania-whose line to the President ran through the White House chief of staff Mark Meadows , formerly the chair of the House Freedom Caucus. The Committee etched another dividing line: among the lawyers, it was Team Normal versus Team Rudy, but among the politicians it was Team Republican Party versus Team Freedom Caucus.\n\nThursday's hearing centered on a dramatic Oval Office meeting on January 3rd, three days before the insurrection. One attendee was a lawyer at the D.O.J. named Jeff Clark, who helped lead the department's environmental division. Clark had met Trump through Rep. Perry, of the Freedom Caucus, and made clear that he would back the President's claims-Clark had gone so far as to draft a D.O.J. letter, at Trump's urging, asking the Georgia state legislature to adopt a fake set of electors rather than those fairly won by President Biden . Also at the meeting were acting Attorney General Jeff Rosen and acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue, who had been running the D.O.J. since Barr's departure, and had refused to send Clark's letter. According to the testimony that Rosen and Donoghue gave on Thursday, the President asked why he should not replace Rosen with Clark, given that Rosen would not do what his Commander-in-Chief wanted. Donoghue told the committee that he had said that Clark was not qualified to either run the Department of Justice or investigate an election-fraud claim-he had never even tried a case. Clark protested that he had led very complicated environmental appeals. In one of the all-time Oval Office disses (assuming it really happened; we only have Donoghue's word here), Donoghue said, \"That's right. You're an environmental lawyer. Go back to your office and we'll call you when there's an oil spill.\" Trump did not make Clark acting Attorney General; Donoghue advised him that if he did all of his Assistant Attorneys General would resign en masse. Trump's own Department of Justice was against him. What he still had were the Freedom Caucus and-seventy-two hours later- a mob .\n\nTrump's instincts are not especially sharp these days, and he seemed to recognize very belatedly that the events of January 6th not only put him in legal jeopardy but political peril, too. For a half decade, part of his pitch has been that, however reluctant the Republican establishment seemed, however disgusted it pretended to be with him, it would always come home to him in the end. But, the same week that the January 6th committee emphasized how even the Trump diehards in the White House, in the days before the riot, were fed up with him, a poll of Republican primary voters in New Hampshire put him behind Ron DeSantis . Brit Hume of Fox News emphasized on air that, if the hearings mean Trump does not run in 2024, then the committee will have \"done the Republican Party a great service,\" because many Republicans \"think they cannot win with Trump at the head of the ticket.\" Speaking with a conservative talk-radio host last week, the former President said that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy 's decision to boycott the January 6th committee was \"very, very foolish\" since that step had allowed Trump's opponents to pick the members of the committee by themselves, and to shape the story as they saw fit. McCarthy did not respond. He has long bowed to Trump, but he has also been an antagonist of the Freedom Caucus, not a member. Is he still on the former President's side?\n\nAt some points during the hearings, a slight suspension of narrative disbelief has been required. Among the many former Trump staffers who have been obviously disgusted by him, none has been so disgusted as the White House lawyer Eric Herschmann, who often appears by Zoom with a black baseball bat mounted on the wall behind him, emblazoned with the word \"JUSTICE.\" (Next to the baseball bat is a large painting of a panda.) Thursday's committee hearing featured Herschmann's description of a conversation with Jeff Clark, the environmental lawyer with dreams of fake electors from Georgia. Herschmann said, \"When he finished discussing what he planned on doing, I said, 'Good, fucking-excuse me-effing A-hole, congratulations. You just admitted that your first step or act you'd take as Attorney General would be committing a felony and violating Rule 6C.' \" Some suppressed inner lawyer in me rebelled: Was that a word-for-word reënactment, complete with subsectional citation? Was it not just a little self-aggrandizing? But the Mississippi judge and the Washington prosecutor let it slide. They have allowed the Republicans who broke with Trump to tell the story, and have praised them as heroes. \"Their bravery is a high moment in the sordid story of what led to January 6,\" Rep. Adam Kinzinger said, on Thursday, speaking of Rosen and Donoghue. As Grisham might have recognized, justice is not the only process under way.\n\nToward the end of Thursday's hearing, Herschmann and several other White House aides (among them, Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to Meadows, and John McEntee, the head of the Office of Presidential Personnel) testified that several members of Congress had contacted the President's advisers to see whether he might preëmptively pardon them, to protect them from any prosecution for their role in January 6th. Rep. Mo Brooks wrote a letter to the White House not only formally requesting a pardon but asking for an \"all-purpose\" pardon for the hundred and forty-seven members of the House of Representatives who objected to the certification of the election. But, for the most part, the committee has cast ordinary Republicans as the heroes. The villains were the six-just six-members of Congress who had reportedly requested pardons for themselves: Brooks (who lost a primary for Senate in Alabama); Rep. Matt Gaetz, of Florida (who is facing a federal probe for sex trafficking ); Rep. Andy Biggs, of Arizona; Rep. Perry, of Pennsylvania; Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene , of Georgia; and Rep. Louie Gohmert, of Texas. It was a sign of just how small the caucus of dead-enders was, and of what political line the hearings have offered to draw for Republicans: civil society on one side, and on the other, the former President, a few lawyers, a half-dozen members of Congress, the Oath Keepers , the Proud Boys, the mob. ♦\n\nWhen the Capitol was breached, a New Yorker reporter became the sole journalist in the Senate chamber to witness its desecration .\n\nInside the chamber, Luke Mogelson captured raw, visceral footage of the siege .\n\nShould Americans refer to the Sixth of January as a protest, an act of treason, or something else ?\n\nWhat the January 6th papers reveal .\n\nHow a mother of eight became one of the riot's biggest mysteries, and a fugitive from the F.B.I.\n\nThe violence was what Donald Trump wanted .\n\nIf America is to remain a democracy, Trump must be held accountable .\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker .\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "Kevin McCarthy and the Republicans' Rocky Road Ahead\n\nThe simplest thing, usually, for a new congressional majority to do is elect a Speaker of the House. Often, the choice has been made in advance: the candidate grins, the chyron gives the tally, a press conference announcing the legislative agenda awaits. This month, the House Republicans, who won a slim majority in November, took fifteen votes and nearly a week to settle on Kevin McCarthy , even though he has led the Party since 2019 and had no serious opponent. The holdouts were about twenty members of the Party's far-right wing, but, even as each vote ended and the next one began, no one really seemed able to say what the conflict was about. John James, whose election in November made him the first Black Republican to represent Michigan in Congress, and who supported McCarthy, pointed out that the last time it had taken so many votes to pick a Speaker was in 1856. \"The issues today are over a few rules and personalities,\" James said. \"While the issues at that time were about slavery and whether the value of a man who looks like me was sixty per cent or a hundred per cent of a human being.\"\n\nThe dividing line between the large number of Republicans backing McCarthy and the smaller, obstinate group standing in his way wasn't exactly ideological. Each camp included some of the prominent election deniers of the House Freedom Caucus. Ohio's Jim Jordan, long one of the most prominent hardliners, was in position to chair the Judiciary Committee, and had allied with McCarthy; so had the Georgia conspiracist Marjorie Taylor Greene , who had reportedly been promised a top committee assignment. The rebels included the Stop the Steal stalwarts Paul Gosar and Scott Perry, as well as the media-focussed right-wingers: Lauren Boebert, of Colorado, who faced calls to be stripped of committee assignments after making anti-Muslim slurs about her Democratic colleague Ilhan Omar; and Matt Gaetz, of Florida, who has been the subject of a federal investigation for sex trafficking but has not faced any charges. Up close, the distinction between these factions sometimes collapsed into personal grievances or turf war. The most dramatic moment came when the McCarthy ally Mike Rogers, of Alabama, lunged toward Gaetz, and was physically restrained. Only later did Politico report that Gaetz had been lobbying to run a subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee, which Rogers was set to chair.\n\nThis mess of personality conflicts and power struggles reflects a core Republican problem right now. The style of the Party is thoroughly Trumpist, and yet its agenda is no longer defined by Trump's specific fixations and fights. Before the fourth vote, the former President issued a statement urging all Republicans to support McCarthy; that failed to move anyone. In the final phase, Greene got Trump on speakerphone and tried to persuade one holdout, Montana's Matt Rosendale, to talk with him. Rosendale, who is enough of a Trump stalwart that he had voted against awarding a Gold Medal to the police officers who defended the Capitol on January 6th, just waved Greene and the former President away.\n\nIn many ways, the G.O.P. has underprepared for the post-Trump era. In 2020, Republicans declined to put forward any formal platform, and they went light on policy in the 2022 midterm campaigns, hoping instead that a reaction against economic inflation and President Biden's unpopularity would sweep them to big majorities. Even Newt Gingrich, interviewed in the Times this month, drew a pointed distinction between the Republican insurgents whom he organized around the Contract with America, in 1994, and the current generation. \"We weren't just grandstanders. We were purposeful,\" Gingrich said. (He also accused Gaetz of \"essentially bringing 'Lord of the Flies' to the House of Representatives.\") In addition to a murky agenda, the Republicans have a weak leader in McCarthy, who is neither especially well known among his party's voters nor especially well liked by them. A Monmouth poll last month found that just twenty-nine per cent of Republicans approved of McCarthy, twenty per cent disapproved, and about half had no opinion.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the way that McCarthy eventually won over his opponents may provide a clue to how he will operate. Mostly, he traded leverage away for support. He agreed to lower the threshold for replacing a Speaker, and to keep a McCarthy-aligned super PAC from picking sides in Republican primaries. Substantively, he agreed to establish a new select subcommittee on the \"weaponization\" of the federal government which Jordan is expected to lead, and is likely to begin with investigations into the Obama-era classified documents that recently turned up in an office that President Biden had used and at his home. (The new Speaker has also agreed to consider formally expunging Trump's impeachment.) More ominously, McCarthy agreed not to raise the debt ceiling without extracting offsetting spending cuts. That concession suggests that the House's year, which seems set to start with investigations into Hunter Biden and border policy, may be punctuated with a standoff over the debt ceiling, in which Republicans threaten to default on the government's debt in the name of small-government principle. And he gave opponents the committee seats they wanted. Fox News asked Byron Donalds, a second-term Black congressman from Florida, whom the insurgents had repeatedly nominated for Speaker, \"What did you get?\" The answer was a spot on the Party's steering committee. Gaetz said that the opposition to McCarthy's election stopped because \"we ran out of stuff to ask for.\"\n\nIf this is, in fact, how the new Speaker has to govern, by cutting individual deals in order to preserve his majority, then his tenure is likely to move from crisis to crisis and may well be short. Already there are little fires everywhere in the caucus: some moderates have balked at the concessions made to the Gaetz faction, at the possibility that McCarthy's debt-ceiling commitments will mean sharp defense cuts, and even at the caucus's extreme line on abortion, which South Carolina's Nancy Mace, a McCarthy ally, denounced as \"tone deaf.\" The main preoccupation of McCarthy's first week as Speaker was the case of the freshman Representative George Santos, of New York, who, in his bid for office, appears to have made up just about every element of his biography: a sterling business record, Jewish heritage, even a star turn on the Baruch College volleyball team. (He was also wanted for fraud in Brazil.) Both the Nassau County G.O.P. and the five other freshman Republicans from New York have called for him to resign, but not McCarthy, whom Santos supported and who doesn't have the margin to cut loose even an obvious liability. It might seem like good news for Democrats that the Republican leadership is this weak-except that weak Republican leadership is what paved the way for Trump in the first place. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez an Insider Now?\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat representing parts of Queens and the Bronx (including Rikers Island), quickly became the most prominent progressive voice in the House of Representatives after she defeated a twenty-year incumbent, Joe Crowley, and went to Capitol Hill in January, 2019. In Congress, she is hardly alone in her advocacy for issues ranging from Medicare for All to the Green New Deal; she belongs to the Bernie Sanders wing of the Party. But few in the history of the institution have so quickly become a focus of attention, admiration, and derision.\n\nElected when she was twenty-nine, the youngest woman ever to serve in the House, Ocasio-Cortez has proved herself an effective examiner in committee hearings and a master of social media. In other words, she offers both substance and flair, and this combination seems to drive her critics to the point of frenzied distraction. Fox News, the Post , and the Daily Mail , along with a collection of right-wing Republican foes in Congress, obsess over her left-wing politics and her celebrity. In November, Paul Gosar, a Republican representative from Arizona who has spoken up for white-nationalist leaders and voted against awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to police officers who defended the Capitol on January 6, 2021, posted an anime sequence that depicted him killing Ocasio-Cortez with a sword. More recently, a former Trump campaign adviser, Steve Cortes, went online to mock Ocasio-Cortez's boyfriend, Riley Roberts, for his sandalled feet, prompting her to fire back, \"If Republicans are mad they can't date me they can just say that instead of projecting their frustrations onto my boyfriend's feet. Ya creepy weirdos.\"\n\nWhen we spoke earlier this month, by Zoom, Ocasio-Cortez talked at length not only about the impasse the Democrats now face but also the general atmosphere of working in Congress. \"Honestly, it is a shit show,\" she said. \"It's scandalizing, every single day. What is surprising to me is how it never stops being scandalizing.\"\n\nThe interview, which was prepared with assistance from Mengfei Chen and Steven Valentino, took place on February 1st, and has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMuch of the Biden Administration's agenda in Congress has pretty much stalled. A term that began with lofty F.D.R.-like ambitions is now at a standstill. How would you rate the President's performance after a year?\n\nThere are some things that are outside of the President's control, and there's very little one can say about that, with Joe Manchin and [Kyrsten] Sinema. But I think there are some things within the President's control, and his hesitancy around them has contributed to a situation that isn't as optimal.\n\nMy concern is that we're getting into analysis paralysis, and we don't have much time. We should really not take this present political moment for granted, and do everything that we can. At the beginning of last year, many of us in the progressive wing-but not just the progressive wing-were saying we don't want to repeat a lot of the hand-wringing that happened in 2010, when there was this very precious opportunity in the Senate for things to happen.\n\nPeople in the Biden White House would argue that the margins are the margins and Manchin's politics are what they are. He comes from a state that is dominated by a much more conservative vote. And Sinema is . . . unpredictable. They would argue that they made concession after concession and still got nowhere.\n\nThe Presidency is so much larger than just the votes in the legislature. This is something that we saw with President Obama. I think we're seeing this dynamic perhaps extend a little bit into the Biden Administration, with a reluctance to use executive power. The President has not been using his executive power to the extent that some would say is necessary.\n\nWhere would you move first?\n\nOne of the single most impactful things President Biden can do is pursue student-loan cancellation. It's entirely within his power. This really isn't a conversation about providing relief to a small, niche group of people. It's very much a keystone action politically. I think it's a keystone action economically as well. And I can't underscore how much the hesitancy of the Biden Administration to pursue student-loan cancellation has demoralized a very critical voting block that the President, the House, and the Senate need in order to have any chance at preserving any of our majority.\n\nWhat is in the realm of the achievable, the realm of the possible, between now and the election?\n\nThat's why I kind of started off by talking about the executive powers of the President, because I don't think that there's any guarantee of getting something through that Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema will approve of that will significantly and materially improve the lives of working people. It's a bit of a dismal assessment, but I think that, given an analysis of their past behavior, it is a fair one. The President has a responsibility to look at the tools that he has.\n\nYou had some political experience before you were elected, but it was from some distance. You weren't a member of Congress. You weren't \"in the room.\" What do you see in the room? What is it like, day to day, being a member of this institution, which, I have to say, from outside, looks like a shit show?\n\nHonestly, it is a shit show. It's scandalizing, every single day. What is surprising to me is how it never stops being scandalizing. Some folks perhaps get used to it, or desensitized to the many different things that may be broken, but there is so much reliance on this idea that there are adults in the room, and, in some respect, there are. But sometimes to be in a room with some of the most powerful people in the country and see the ways that they make decisions-sometimes they're just susceptible to groupthink, susceptible to self-delusion.\n\nSketch it out for us. What does it look like?\n\nThe infrastructure plan, if it does what it's intended to do, politicians will take credit for it ten years from now, if we even have a democracy ten years from now. But the Build Back Better Act is the vast majority of Biden's agenda. The infrastructure plan, as important as it is, is much smaller. So we were talking about pairing these two things together. The Progressive Caucus puts up a fight, and then somewhere around October there comes a critical juncture. The President is then under enormous pressure from the media. There's this idea that the President can't \"get things done,\" and that his Presidency is at risk. It's what I find to be just a lot of sensationalism. However, the ramifications of that were being very deeply felt. And you have people running tough races, and it's \"he needs a win.\" And so I'm sitting there in a group with some of the most powerful people in the country talking about how, if we pass the infrastructure bill right now, then this will be what the President can campaign on. The American people will give him credit for it. He can win his Presidency on it. If we don't pass it now, then we've risked democracy itself.\n\nWho's in the room? You say the most powerful people.\n\nYou're talking about everybody from leadership to folks who are in tough seats, but all elected officials in the Democratic Party on the federal level. And people really just talk themselves into thinking that passing the infrastructure plan on that day, in that week, is the most singular important decision of the Presidency, more than voting rights, more than the Build Back Better Act itself, which contains the vast majority of the President's actual plan. You're kind of sitting there in the room and watching people work themselves up into a decision. It's a fascinating psychological moment that you're watching unfold.\n\nIt's not to say that all these things that they're saying are a hundred-per-cent false. But I come from a community that is often discounted in many different ways, because, you know, these are \"reliable Democrats.\" Like, what she has to say doesn't matter, etc. What does she know about this political moment? The thing that's unfortunate, and what a lot of people have yet to recognize, is that the motivations and the sense of investment and faith in our democracy and governance from people in communities like mine also determine majorities. They also determine the outcomes of statewide races and Presidential races. And, when you have a gerrymandered House, when you have the Senate constructed the way that it is, when you have a Presidency that relies on the Electoral College in the fashion that it does, you're in this room and you see that all of these people who are elected are truly representative of our current political system. And our current political system is designed to revolve around a very narrow band of people who are, over all, materially O.K. It does not revolve around the majority.\n\nYou've used a phrase \" if we have a democracy ten years from now.\" Do you think we won't?\n\nI think there's a very real risk that we will not. What we risk is having a government that perhaps postures as a democracy, and may try to pretend that it is, but isn't.\n\nWhat's going to bring us to that point? You hear talk now about our being on the brink of civil war -that's the latest phrase in a series of books that have come out. What will happen to bring us to that degraded point?\n\nWell, I think it has started, but it's not beyond hope. We're never beyond hope. But we've already seen the opening salvos of this, where you have a very targeted, specific attack on the right to vote across the United States, particularly in areas where Republican power is threatened by changing electorates and demographics. You have white-nationalist, reactionary politics starting to grow into a critical mass. What we have is the continued sophisticated takeover of our democratic systems in order to turn them into undemocratic systems, all in order to overturn results that a party in power may not like.\n\nThe concern is that we will look like what other nation?\n\nI think we will look like ourselves. I think we will return to Jim Crow. I think that's what we risk.\n\nWhat's the scenario for that?\n\nYou have it already happening in Texas, where Jim Crow-style disenfranchisement laws have already been proposed. You had members of the state legislature, just a few months ago, flee the state in order to prevent such voting laws from being passed. In Florida, where you had the entire state vote to allow people who were released from prison to be reënfranchised after they have served their debt to society, that's essentially being replaced with poll taxes and intimidation at the polls. You have the complete erasure and attack on our own understanding of history, to replace teaching history with institutionalized propaganda from white-nationalist perspectives in our schools. This is what the scaffolding of Jim Crow was.\n\nSo there are many impulses to compare this to somewhere else. There are certainly plenty of comparisons to make-with the rise of fascism in post-World War One Germany. But you really don't have to look much further than our own history, because what we have, I think, is a uniquely complex path that we have walked. And the question that we're really facing is: Was the last fifty to sixty years after the Civil Rights Act just a mere flirtation that the United States had with a multiracial democracy that we will then decide was inconvenient for those in power? And we will revert to what we had before, which, by the way, wasn't just Jim Crow but also the extraordinary economic oppression as well?\n\nDo you think many Republicans share your concern about the fate of democracy? Do you have those kinds of conversations?\n\nIt's a complex question because there's so many different kinds of Republicans. But I'm reluctant to get into the navel-gazing of it, because, at the end of the day, they all make the same decisions. You might be able to appeal to the good natures or even a sense of charity of a handful, but ultimately we have what we have. At the end of the day, you know, who cares if they're true believers or if they're just complicit? They're still voting to overturn the results of our election.\n\nWe're constantly told, if you could only hear what's being said in the cloakrooms, a lot of Republicans find Donald Trump repulsive but know that they're going to lose their seats if they say so. Is being in Congress such a great job that you will trade your principles and soul for that job?\n\nWhat I think some Republicans struggle with, the very few that are in that position, is a concern that they will be replaced by someone even worse. You know, O.K., externally I might look like a good soldier, I might look like I'm falling in line, but, if I lose my primary and I get replaced with ten more Marjorie Taylor Greenes, we'll be in an even worse situation.\n\nThat's perhaps where they may be coming from. And, to a certain extent, you do have these critical moments. You have January 6th, and, if Mike Pence had made a different split-second decision that day and done what President Trump was asking of him, we would be in a very different place right now.\n\nWhen you are asked questions about whether or not Nancy Pelosi should stay as Speaker, when you're asked questions about the rather advanced ages of Steny Hoyer, Jim Clyburn, and Chuck Schumer, does it make a difference? You're saying it's structural. It's not generational.\n\nIt's both. The reason we have this generational situation that we do is also, in part, due to our structures. The generational aspect of things is absolutely pertinent to the kind of decision-making. There is this world view, this appeal, of a time passed that I think sometimes guides decision-making. President Biden thought that he could talk with Manchin like an old pal and bring him along. And, frankly, that was what the White House's strategy was, in terms of what they communicated to us. That's how they tried to sell passage of not even half a loaf but a tenth of the loaf. It was \"We promise we'll be able to bring them along.\" There is this idea that this is just a temporary thing and we'll get back to that. But I grew up my entire life in this mess. There's no nostalgia for a time when Washington worked in my life.\n\nIs it healthy or not for the Democratic Party for Nancy Pelosi to remain in place as the Speaker, as leader of the Democratic caucus in the House?\n\nIt's really all about a specific moment that we're in. We are in such a delicate moment of the day-to-day, particularly with the threats to our democracy. I believe that, at the end of the day, there's going to be a generational change in our leadership. That is just a simple fact. Now, when that particular moment happens? I think it's a larger question of conditions and circumstance.\n\nYou don't want to go near this one.\n\nIt's a tough question. It's not even just a question of the Speaker. It's a question of our caucus. I wish the Democratic Party had more stones. I wish our party was capable of truly supporting bold leadership that can address root causes.\n\nIs it that the representatives don't have the stones, or do you want a different public opinion, as it were? In other words, for example, take \"defund the police\" as a policy demand. Certainly, in New York City, no one is talking about that now. As a matter of protest? Yes. As activism? Yes. But we have a new mayor, Eric Adams , who is anything but \"defund the police.\" Who are you disappointed in?\n\nI still am disappointed in leadership and in my colleagues, because, ultimately, these conversations about \"defund,\" or this, that, and the other, are what is happening in public and popular conversations. Our job is to be able to engage in that conversation, to read what is happening, and to be able to develop a vision and translate it into a course of action. All too often, I believe that a lot of our decisions are reactive to public discourse instead of responsive to public discourse. And so, just because there was this large conversation about \"defund the police\" coming from the streets, the response was to immediately respond to it with fear, with pooh-poohing, with \"this isn't us,\" with arm's distance. So, then, what is the vision? That's where I think the Party struggles.\n\nAren't you seeing the response in City Hall now in the shape of Eric Adams?\n\nWell, I think you also see it in the shape of the City Council that was elected. You have a record number of progressives. People often bring up the Mayor as evidence of some sort of decision around policing. I disagree with that assessment. I represent a community that is very victimized by a rise in violence. (And I represent Rikers Island!) What oftentimes people overlook is that the same communities that supported Mayor Adams also elected Tiffany Cabán . What the public wants is a strong sense of direction. I don't think that in electing Mayor Adams everyone in the city supports bringing back torture to Rikers Island in the form of solitary confinement. What people want is a strong vision about how we establish public safety in our communities.\n\nOne of the ways that we engage is by backing some of the only policies that are actually supported by evidence to reduce incidents of violent crime: violence-interruption programs, summer youth employment. When we talk about the surge of violence happening right now, when I engage with our hospitals, doctors, social workers, everyone's telling me that there's so many things we're not discussing. The surge in violence is being driven by young people, particularly young men. And we allow the discourse to make it sound as though it's, like, these shady figures in the bush, jumping out from a corner. These are young men. These are boys. We're also not discussing the mental-health crisis that we are experiencing as a country as a result of the pandemic.\n\nBecause we run away from substantive discussions about this, we don't want to say some of the things that are obvious, like, Gee, the child-tax credit just ran out, on December 31st, and now people are stealing baby formula. We don't want to have that discussion. We want to say these people are criminals or we want to talk about \"people who are violent,\" instead of \"environments of violence,\" and what we're doing to either contribute to that or dismantle that.\n\nI've never seen anybody so quickly become a lightning rod for right-wing criticism and obsession. Why do you think there's such a fixation on you personally?\n\nI think there's just some surface-level stuff. And, to be honest, it's not just the right wing. I was laughing because a couple of months ago someone showed me some of the news footage and coverage from the night that I was elected. And, obviously, I didn't see any of it because I was, like, losing my mind.\n\nBut there was this footage, I think it was Brian Williams. And it was, like, breaking news: the third-most-powerful Democrat in the House of Representatives seems to have been unseated by this radical socialist. All the buzzwords that the right wing uses now were also completely legitimized by mainstream media on the night of the election. I never had a chance. People act as though there was something I could have done. There really wasn't. It was kind of baked in from the beginning, and my choice was how to respond to that.\n\nAnd I think because I respond to it differently, that increases a certain level of novelty, which then increases interest. But then there's also just the basic stuff. I'm young, I'm a woman, I'm a woman of color. I'm not liberal in a traditional sense. I'm willing to buck against my own party, and in a real way. And I'm everything that they need. I'm the red meat for their base.\n\nDo you worry sometimes that you take the bait too much or poke the bear in a way that might not be, in retrospect, something you should've done? Like, for example, the Met Gala, the \" Tax the Rich \" dress, or your response to the really weird tweet about your boyfriend's feet?\n\nAll the time. Every day you make decisions, and you have to make decisions about whether it's a good idea to go after this or if it's a bad idea to go after it. Sometimes you make good decisions. Sometimes you make less-than-optimal ones. And then you reflect on them and you try to kind of sharpen your steel.\n\nWhat were the less-than-optimal ones?\n\nEverything has a different goal, right? And so, if you're at home on Twitter, or if you're at home on TV, there are some things that are not for you. There are some things I do that you don't like that are not intended for you to like, such as what happened with the Met Gala. There are a lot of folks who did not like that. There were some \"principled leftists\" who didn't like that. But, when you look at my community, it's not a college town, a socialist, leftist, academic community. It's a working-class community that I'm able to engage in a collective conversation about our principles. And, honestly, there's a response to that in some circles online that may be negative, but in my community the response was quite positive.\n\nThe response to the Met Gala was positive in your community? How did you feel it?\n\nYeah. Because sometimes you just need to give a little Bronx jeer to the rich and to the spectacle. You need to puncture the façade. My community and my family-we're postal workers, my uncle is a maintenance man, my mom's a domestic worker. Sometimes you just need to have that moment.\n\nIt is a bizarre psychological experience to live specifically now in 2022. We're not even talking about a culture of celebrity. We're talking about a culture of commodification of human beings, from the bottom all the way to the top. And there's absolutely a bizarre psychological experience of this that also plays into these decisions. For example, like what happened in responding to these bizarre things, like about my boyfriend's feet. I've felt for a long time that we need to talk about the bizarre psychological impulses underpinning the right wing.\n\nIt's not \"politically correct\" to be able to talk about these things, but they are so clearly having an obvious impact on not just our public discourse but the concentration of power. We have to talk about patriarchy, racism, capitalism, but you're not going to have those conversations by using those words. You have to have those conversations by really responding in uplifting moments. I don't really care if other people understand it. Sometimes what seems to some folks a moment that's gauche or something, I often do it with the intention of exposing cultural or psychological undercurrents that people don't want to talk about. Which, by the way, is why I think sometimes people read these moments as gauche or low-class or whatever they may be. And sometimes how I feel is, if I'm just going to be this, like, commodified avatar thing, then I'm going to play with it, like a toy.\n\nIt's a rough thing to deal with.\n\nYeah. It's awful.\n\nOne of the cudgels used by the right these days, and not only the right, is fear about cancellation and \"wokeness.\" We've even heard members of the House give speeches about the dangers of so-called cancel culture. And, at the same time, it does seem like norms around speech are changing around fears of online backlashes. I know you've criticized that term, \"cancel culture,\" even dismissed it, but you did so in a tweet.\n\nYou look at the capture of power in the right wing, the ascent of white nationalism, the concentration of wealth. You cannot really animate or concentrate a movement like that-you can't coalesce it into functional political power-without a sense of persecution or victimhood. And that's the role of this concept of cancel culture. It's the speck of dust around which the raindrop must form in order to precipitate takeovers of school boards, pushing actual discourse out of the acceptable norms, like in terms of the 1619 Project or getting books banned from schools. They need the concept of cancel culture, of persecution, in order to justify, animate, and pursue a political program of takeover, or at least a constant further concentration of their own power.\n\nYou talk about cancel culture. But notice that those discussions only go one way. We don't talk about all the people who were fired. You just kind of talk about, like, right-leaning podcast bros and more conservative figures. But, for example, Marc Lamont Hill was fired [from CNN] for discussing an issue with respect to Palestinians, pretty summarily. There was no discussion about it, no engagement, no thoughtful discourse over it, just pure accusation.\n\nLast month, an ex-staffer of New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand's told the New York Post that you could mount \"a very, very credible challenge and quite likely beat her.\" How do you feel about that? How do you view your political future?\n\nI'm not trying to be, like, \"I'm not like the other girls.\" I'm not trying to position myself in that way. But I don't think that I make these kinds of decisions as if I'm operating with some sort of ten-to-fifteen-year plan, like a lot of people do. Half this town, if not more, has been to a fancy Ivy League school. And so, as a consequence, everyone is, like, what chess pieces are being put down for what specific aspiration? I make decisions based on where I think people are and what we're ready for, particularly as a movement. I think a lot of people sometimes make these decisions based on what they want, right? What I want is a lot more decentralized. I think it's a lot more rooted in mass movements.\n\nCould you see yourself walking away from public office entirely and going to a life of mass movements?\n\nI think about it all the time. When I entertain possibilities for my future, it's like anybody else. I could be doing what I'm doing in a little bit of a different form, but I could also not be in elected office as well. It could come in so many different forms. I wake up, and I'm, like, what would be the most effective thing to do to advance the power and build the power of working people?\n\nWell, do you wake up sometimes in your Capitol Hill apartment and say, What the hell am I doing here? I'm one representative out of hundreds. I'm in a gridlocked situation. I'm not effecting the change I want to, and I'd rather join, or lead, or help lead a movement outside of government?\n\nI've had those thoughts, absolutely. We all have different options in front of us. And the choice of what option we take at any given point is a reflection of all of those conditions, our motivations, all of those things. And there are times when I'm cynical and I sometimes fall into that. I'm just, like, \"Man, maybe I should just, like, learn to grow my own food and teach other people how to do that!\"\n\nBut I also reject the total cynicism that what's happening here is fruitless. I've been in this cycle before in my life, before I even ran for office, before it was even a thought.\n\nThe social-media folks at The New Yorker invited people to propose questions for you via Instagram. Hope is the theme that is the center of almost all of these. If I can distill them, the most basic question is, What would you say to people, particularly young people, who have lost hope?\n\nI've been there. And what I can say is that, when you're feeling like you've lost hope, it's a very passive experience, which is part of what makes it so depressing.\n\nAnd that's what I had to go through. There was all this hope when Obama was elected, in 2008. And, at the end of the day, a lot of people that had hope in our whole country had those hopes dashed.\n\nI graduated. My dad died. My family had medical debt, because we live in the jankiest medical system in the developed world. My childhood home was on the precipice of being taken away by big banks. I'd be home, and there'd be bankers in cars parked in front of my house, taking pictures for the inevitable day that they were going to kick us out.\n\nI was supposed to be the great first generation to go to college, and I graduated into a recession where bartending, legitimately, and waitressing, legitimately, paid more than any college-level entry job that was available to me. I had a complete lack of hope. I saw a Democratic Party that was too distracted by institutionalized power to stand up for working people. And I decided this is bullshit. No one, absolutely no one, cares about people like me, and this is hopeless. And I lost hope.\n\nHow did that manifest itself?\n\nIt manifested in depression. Feeling like you have no agency, and that you are completely subject to the decisions of people who do not care about you, is a profoundly depressing experience. It's a very invisibilizing experience. And I lived in that for years. This is where sometimes what I do is speak to the psychology of our politics rather than to the polling of our politics. What's really important for people to understand is that to change that tide and to actually have this well of hope you have to operate on your direct level of human experience.\n\nWhen people start engaging individually enough, it starts to amount to something bigger. We have a culture of immediate gratification where if you do something and it doesn't pay off right away we think it's pointless.\n\nBut, if more people start to truly cherish and value the engagement and the work in their own back yard, it will precipitate much larger change. And the thing about people's movements is that the opposite is very top-down. When you have folks with a profound amount of money, power, influence, and they really want to make something happen, they start with media. You look at these right-wing organizations, they create YouTube channels. They create their podcast stars. They have Fox News as their own personal ideological television outlet.\n\nLegitimate change in favor of public opinion is the opposite. It takes a lot of mass-public-building engagement, unrecognized work until it gets to the point that it is so big that to ignore it threatens the legitimacy of mass-media outlets, institutions of power, etc. It has to get so big that it is unignorable, in order for these positions up top to respond. And so people get very discouraged here.\n\nGoing forward, what do you think is the optimal role for you to play?\n\nWith the Climate Justice Alliance, some communities here at home say that they don't talk about leadership, they talk about being leaderful. And I think that people's movements, especially in the United States, are leaderful. And we're getting more people every day. The untold story is actually the momentum of what is happening on the ground. You have Starbucks that just unionized its first shops in Buffalo. I went up there to visit them. Sure, I went over there to support a mayoral election which didn't ultimately pan out, but also to support a lot of what was going on. I would argue that if it wasn't for that mayoral election and the amount of intensity and organizing and hope and attention, a lot of these workers who were organizing may have given up.\n\nThere is no movement, there is no effort, there is no unionizing, there is no fight for the vote, there is no resistance to draconian abortion laws, if people think that the future is baked in and nothing is possible and that we're doomed. Even on climate-or especially on climate. And so the day-to-day of my day job is frustrating. So is everyone else's. I ate shit when I was a waitress and a bartender, and I eat shit as a member of Congress. It's called a job, you know?\n\nSo, yes, I deal with the wheeling and dealing and whatever it is, that insider stuff, and I advance amendments that some people would criticize as too little, etc. I also advance big things that people say are unrealistic and naïve. Work is like that. It is always the great fear when it comes to work or pursuing anything. You want to write something, and, in your head, it's this big, beautiful Nobel Prize-winning concept. And then you are humbled by the words that you actually put on paper.\n\nAnd that is the work of movement. That is the work of organizing. That is the work of elections. That is the work of legislation. That is the work of theory, of concepts, you know?

      "text": "Madison Cawthorn's Icarus Moment\n\nWhen North Carolina voters rejected Madison Cawthorn's bid for a second term in Congress last week, he seemed to go quietly. As the results rolled in, Cawthorn left his Election Night celebration in Hendersonville, and let aides announce that he had conceded the Republican primary to a locally known state senator named Chuck Edwards. A congratulatory tweet from his campaign account, @CawthornforNC, was as generous as it was uncharacteristic: \"It's time for the NC-11 GOP to rally behind the Republican ticket to defeat the Democrats' nominee this November.\"\n\nThat was then. A few days after his defeat, he posted a screed more typically his style, lumping Republicans and Democrats into an ominous \"Uni-party\" that had taken him down. \"It's time for the rise of the new right, it's time for Dark MAGA to truly take command. We have an enemy to defeat, but we will never be able to defeat them until we defeat the cowardly and weak members of our own party,\" Cawthorn wrote , on Instagram. Under the heading \"America First Patriots,\" he compiled a gallery of \"honorable men and women,\" some of whom took his side. They included Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar, and also Tucker Carlson, Mike Cernovich, \"the great Charlie Kirk,\" the N.R.A. , and, of course, Donald Trump , who'd endorsed Cawthorn. \"He's a genius,\" Cawthorn said of the former President earlier this year. \"Trump is like a father to me.\"\n\nWhen it came time to vote, neither Trump's backing, nor Cawthorn's sallies into the culture wars-he'd introduced a bill, five days before the primary, to require the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to include \"aborted children\" in official death counts-were enough to save him. In one sense, he lost narrowly, finishing second to Edwards by about thirteen hundred votes, out of nearly ninety thousand cast. By another measure, the vote was a rare repudiation of a sitting member of Congress. (Over the past half century, more than nine in ten House incumbents have won reëlection.) In his race, sixty-eight per cent of voters chose one of the seven candidates not named Cawthorn. Edwards won the nomination by finishing first, with at least thirty per cent of the vote. He will face a Democrat from Asheville, Jasmine Beach-Ferrara, in November. Even before the race was called, a delighted critic dug up and retweeted Cawthorn's mocking first post from the night of his 2020 election victory: \"Cry more, lib.\"\n\nIt's not at all clear what Cawthorn meant, when he threatened, after his loss, \"to expose those who say and promise one thing yet legislate and work towards another, self-profiteering, globalist goal\"-or whether Dark MAGA actually exists. According to the University of Maryland researcher Caroline Orr Bueno , Dark MAGA is a nascent agglomeration of trolls, gamers, white supremacists, and other right-wing figures, such as Greene and Jack Posobiec , who aim to rebrand Trumpism ahead of the 2024 Presidential race. Cawthorn's spokesperson, Luke Ball, declined to elaborate. Ronna McDaniel, the head of the Republican National Committee, and a Trump supporter, has claimed not to know what it is.\n\nMore certain is that the twenty-six-year-old Cawthorn, the youngest member of Congress and one of its most audacious , flubbed his star turn in almost every way possible, via a seemingly unending series of self-inflicted calamities. The G.O.P. establishment in North Carolina, led by Senator Thom Tillis, apparently came to despise him; a super PAC connected to Tillis reportedly spent more than three hundred thousand dollars on an attack ad that said Cawthorn \"lies for the limelight.\" But Cawthorn also proved terrible-negligent, his critics said-at constituent service. Even Karl Rove cautioned Cawthorn last year to tend the home fires.\n\n\"While you can gain a national following acting like Cawthorn, you can't build a political organization in a district without acting like Edwards,\" John Hood, the president of North Carolina's conservative John William Pope Foundation, told me a few days after Cawthorn's defeat. \"This is not ideological. The perception is, 'He's irresponsible.' He obviously just got carried away with his sudden fame.\" It's a view I heard often-Cawthorn as Icarus. A charismatic, home-schooled, college dropout with a tragic backstory, he flew into Washington and onto Fox News, only to fall just as fast. As for the future of Dark MAGA , Hood was dismissive. \"I do not think there is some serious Dark MAGA movement. Aimless young men like to make things up and talk to one another.\"\n\nCawthorn's electoral prospects had rested on sandy soil for weeks before the election. There were the multiple tickets for speeding and charges of driving with a revoked license, the times he tried to carry a gun onto an airplane, and his claim that he had been invited to an orgy by his colleagues in Washington. Shortly after, there were the photos of him in women's lingerie ; the video of him simulating sex with another man, whom he has referred to as his cousin; the allegations of insider trading and improper relations with one of his staffers; and the time he called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a \"thug.\" Kevin McCarthy told Cawthorn that he had lost the House Minority leader's trust. (Cawthorn declined my request for an interview.)\n\nThe barrage of negative news was relentless and memorable. But what most undid Cawthorn was a tactical mistake. Seven months ago, in his Republican-leaning district in the mountains of western North Carolina, Cawthorn's path to reëlection looked smooth. His only declared primary opponents were three newcomers, who had fewer resources, and none of his skill for stoking grievance. Suddenly, however, Cawthorn jumped districts, announcing that he would leave the Eleventh and move to the newly drawn Thirteenth. The new district had no incumbent, leaned even more Republican, and included a piece of the Charlotte media market-valuable territory as he contemplated a future run for governor. \"We are taking ground for conservatism,\" he declared on Twitter. \"Trust me to fight for you.\"\n\nTo many voters in his current district, who had trusted him to fight for them , his flight to more favorable turf was a betrayal. Cawthorn likely would have sailed to victory in the new Thirteenth, but the North Carolina Supreme Court determined that the state's maps had been illegally gerrymandered in favor of Republicans, and ordered them redrawn. The fresh maps wiped out the new district, and, some four months after leaving the Eleventh behind, he returned to it. In the meantime, things had changed. New candidates had entered the race, most notably Edwards, a seasoned state senator, who already possessed a working political operation in the district's most populous counties. Robert Orr, a retired North Carolina Supreme Court justice who helped draw the latest congressional maps, told me that Edwards is \"vanilla, nose to the grindstone, at least as conservative, but he's not as offensively conservative.\" Establishment Republicans, seeing their chance to oust Cawthorn, rushed to support Edwards.\n\nWhen I last interviewed Cawthorn, in December, 2021, he was confident that his \"grassroots army\" and millions of dollars in campaign donations would return him to office. But his army failed to materialize, he ran through his money-more than $3.5 million, at last count -and the powerful Republican leaders in the state ganged up on him. Senator Richard Burr, the retiring North Carolina Republican, said of Cawthorn , \"On any given day, he's an embarrassment.\" Tillis, who endorsed Edwards, decried Cawthorn's \"consistent pattern of juvenile behavior, outlandish statements, and untruthfulness.\" I asked Orr, the former North Carolina Supreme Court justice, about the reaction to Cawthorn's defeat. \"Up in the mountains, I think there was a sense of relief,\" Orr said. \"I haven't heard any bitterness.\" Hood agreed. Many state leaders and donors saw him as a threat to the Party's fortunes in a closely divided state; others had feared running afoul of him.\n\nMichele Woodhouse started the 2022 campaign cycle as the chair of the Eleventh District G.O.P. and a vocal supporter of Cawthorn. She describes herself as an \"AMERICA First Patriot\" and \"Bold, Pro-Life Conservative.\" When Cawthorn left for the new district, she decided to run for his seat in the Eleventh. Cawthorn had supported her candidacy, but when he returned to the race, she told me that members of his staff tried to nudge her off the field. (Cawthorn's spokesperson denied this.) She wouldn't go, and she could see that he was in trouble. \"The lack of constituent services, the lack of responsiveness, missing congressional votes-I think Madison lacked maturity, accountability,\" she said. \"He lost a chunk of his base that he could never get back.\" (Woodhouse finished the primary in sixth place.)\n\nRepublicans have controlled the Eleventh since 2013, when Mark Meadows , Trump's future chief of staff, won the seat, and many think Edwards is a shoo-in to beat Beach-Ferrara in November. \"There is no district in the country that leans this far toward the Republican Party and is represented by a Democrat,\" Christopher A. Cooper, a Western Carolina University political-science professor who studies the district closely, said. But Woodhouse isn't so sure. The North Carolina G.O.P., she told me, \"did an exceptional job of nominating a bunch of rich, white men.\"\n\nBeach-Ferrara, a Buncombe County commissioner who attended Brown and Harvard, is a United Church of Christ minister and L.G.B.T.Q. activist raising three children with her wife. In her announcement video , she talked about Republicans and Democrats finding common ground to confront the opioid and mental-health crises in her county. Cooper doubts Beach-Ferrara's story will resonate beyond the liberal confines of Asheville. What will resonate is an open question. In the primary, Woodhouse pointed out, twice as many people voted against the establishment as voted for it. She sees Cheri Beasley, the Black former chief justice of the State Supreme Court and current Democratic nominee for the Senate, as a dynamic presence at the top of the ticket who will drive turnout. And she worries about Republican messaging: \" 'I love Donald Trump more than you love Donald Trump. Joe Biden is bad.' That does not inspire the American people.\"\n\nCawthorn, meanwhile, has seven months left in Congress. He faces a House Ethics Committee investigation and court dates to defend his driving record and attempt to carry a loaded gun onto an airplane in Charlotte. On Monday, after the ethics investigation was announced, Cawthorn tweeted, \"Wow- I must still be a problem for the swamp! They're still coming after me!\" He remains a proven draw at G.O.P. gatherings, notably for Turning Point USA, the high-energy organization for young conservatives run by his friend and ally Charlie Kirk. Does Cawthorn have a political future in North Carolina? \"Redemption is always possible,\" Hood said. \"He's going to have to basically rebuild his life on a more stable foundation.\" Cawthorn, he said, should not be counted out. \"He still almost won.\"\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "C-SPAN Unleashes Its Inner Scorsese\n\nPathetic? Enraging? Ludicrous? Honestly pretty funny, but in a patience-testing, Andy Kaufman sort of way? For most Americans, this week's marathon voting sessions to elect (or not) a Speaker of the House were all of those things. But, for connoisseurs of C- SPAN , serial failure made for riveting television, at least by that network's normal production standards, which veer more toward vintage Soviet broadcasts than toward \"Real Housewives\" or the N.F.L. on Fox. The usual approach features locked-down cameras focussed tightly on individual speechmakers, a rigid mise en scène only occasionally enlivened by a wide-angle shot of the House floor, as if cutting to security-camera footage. But as the G.O.P. butted heads with its own rump faction, humiliating the Party's nominal head Kevin McCarthy through round after round of losses, C- SPAN 's cameras, freed from their normal strictures for reasons we'll get to in a moment, were panning and zooming and cutting back and forth with an almost cinematic brio.\n\nThere were vivid tableaux, especially on the first day, as the House floor churned with energy and the aisles filled with knots of gesticulating legislators; viewers-especially if they were cinéastes with generous imaginations-may have been reminded of the roiling, Old Master-inspired crowd scenes in \"Raging Bull.\" At times, the network ignored the main \"action\" altogether to focus on ancillary dramas, like the polite but animated parleys between the Democratic \"squad\" member Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the MAGA -ists Paul Gosar and Matt Gaetz, which made news during the first day of voting. Turning up again and again, like a scene-stealing supporting player, was the representative-elect George Santos, the Queens-Long Island fabulist. Here he hovered expectantly near a scrum of rebel Republicans, who were doing their best to ignore him; there he sat next to the McCarthy loyalist Marjorie Taylor-Green, who seemed intent on making eye contact with anyone else. A pariah, but the camera adored him.\n\n\"I love the shots on the new 'looser' C- SPAN . It's kind of like C- SPAN after hours,\" said David Mandel, the TV showrunner and director (\"Veep\"; the forthcoming HBO Max Watergate comedy, \"White House Plumbers\"). \"I love seeing the side chats, the attempts at dealmaking, and, most importantly, I love watching the Democrats try to pretend they aren't enjoying every second of it.\" He added one caveat: \"Sadly, there is no sound. We need everyone miked like an N.F.L. game.\" Nevertheless, viewers were rewarded with all manner of minor-key vérité drama, as when the camera caught a male representative telling a joke to a female representative, who responded with what looked like a charity laugh, then got up and left. On subsequent days, as the mood became enervated, the mix of stasis and routine was its own drama. A stifled yawn . . . a stifled laugh . . . the drudgery of standing up once again to vote for Byron Donalds. This was C- SPAN doing \"Jeanne Dielman.\"\n\nOr was this C- SPAN doing \"Twilight\"? Supernatural teen melodrama was what the director Judd Apatow saw in shots of huddled G.O.P. rebels relishing the attention. He said that he was reminded of \"the scenes where the evil vampires, the Volturi coven, gather to conspire. Every smile gives me the willies. They are clearly planning their attack on the Cullen family.\"\n\nThe Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network launched in 1979, aiming for neither art house nor multiplex. Rather, it began just the way you'd imagine: with a platitudinous speech on the floor of the House from the then representative Al Gore, Jr. The network was allowed to cover day-to-day business in the House and the Senate on the condition that the leadership of each institution control the cameras and the feeds. If you are a senator or a representative who doesn't want to be spotted doing Wordle instead of the people's business, you probably like this arrangement, although it's not foolproof. The former senator Al Franken recalled a couple of instances when he was caught on C- SPAN performing \"physical humor\" that arguably \"didn't look terribly senatorial. I think once it was like a little dance, like I was showing Marco Rubio a move.\" But here's the loophole: on certain occasions, such as when Congress is in joint session for the State of the Union address or for a speech from a foreign dignitary like Volodymyr Zelensky, C- SPAN is permitted to call its own shots. This is also the case for the opening of a new Congress, when the Speaker is chosen. These elections are usually pro forma; this year, you might say that the network has found itself in the happy position of a wedding videographer at a ceremony that has gone horribly but amusingly awry.\n\nHave C- SPAN 's people been enjoying the gift? \"Oh, absolutely,\" Benjamin O'Connell, the network's director of editorial operations, said. \"I don't think it's been lost on anyone here that we are participating in a historic event by showing something so unusual to the American people.\" O'Connell acknowledged that many people think C- SPAN is \"boring,\" but insisted that he and his colleagues take their craft and their mission as seriously as anyone at Hulu or Film Forum. \"It's all about visual storytelling,\" he said. His personal taste in movies runs toward indie filmmakers like Kelly Reichardt and Jim Jarmusch. Has any of their DNA made it into C- SPAN ? The question made him laugh. \"I don't know if I can claim it with a straight face,\" he admitted, \"but I would like to think so.\" ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Slate's guide to the most important figures in politics this week.\n\nWelcome to this week's edition of the Surge. The Capitol will open for visitors again on Monday, but why visit when you can learn all you need to know about the place in this newsletter? True fact: You can't tell from TV, but none of the senators wear pants.\n\nThis week, we look again at the infrastructure debate, and how Democrats want to pay for it with Republican human sacrifices, and vice versa. You can see the possible deal, no? Weirdly, though, with all that \"Washington yammerin' \" in the background, the Senate is being relatively productive (more than zero percent) on some other bipartisan legislation. Nancy Pelosi was at her peak this week-holding the line without a defection on a difficult vote, and then nearly canceling herself the instant she had to speak publicly-and Rep. Steve Stivers is continuing the proud Ohio tradition of quitting midterm to lead an Ohio business trade association.\n\nAnd while we will talk about Marjorie Taylor Greene, let's first talk about the actual worst member of Congress.\n\nBy Jim Newell\n\nThe media generally cannot get enough of writing about right-wing nutcases in the House Republican caucuses, yet somehow Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar, D.D.S., seems to fly under the radar relative to Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Louie Gohmert, or Lauren Boebert. But Gosar is probably the most far-gone nativist member in Congress. No one in Congress was more devoted to the \"Stop the Steal\" cause, for which he organized rallies. \"Once we conquer the Hill,\" Gosar said at a December rally in Arizona, \"Donald Trump is returned to being president.\" He got the first part right, at least, on Jan. 6. In February, Gosar was the only sitting member of Congress to speak at a white nationalist event , the America First Political Action Conference, after which the crowd chanted his name. And just recently, Gosar, along with Greene, was busted after an early platform draft for their proposed \"America First Caucus,\" rife with nativist dog whistles about preserving \"Anglo-Saxon political traditions\" (in the section about immigration) and restoring the \"architectural, engineering and aesthetic value that befits the progeny of European architecture.\" Gosar denied authorship of the memo, and the proposed caucus fizzled out faster than the soccer super league. If you think of Greene as the person who reads baffling nativist conspiracies online and shares them on Facebook, think of Gosar as the reply guy in the comments saying you didn't know this? His own family hates him, and he hates the pope. He maintains his membership on the Natural Resources Committee, as well as the Oversight and Reform Committee.\n\nRepublicans are finally putting a counteroffer to Joe Biden's $2.2 trillion infrastructure plan to paper. Led by Shelley Moore Capito, the GOP's proposal, going by early reports, would clock in between $550 billion and $880 billion, depending on the time horizon. The price tag itself is not the biggest concern, as Democrats could always use reconciliation later to tack on what the bipartisan market wouldn't bear. The bigger issue about reaching a bipartisan agreement is how to pay for it. Democrats and the Biden administration are against increasing (or creating new) user fees and prefer to raise taxes on corporations. The Capito-led plan, meanwhile, would be funded through some combination of new user fees for electric vehicles (eat shit, Prius libs), public-private partnerships, and ... repurposing money from Democrats' $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill, like the $350 billion for state and local aid. In other words, each side wants to pay for lovely new roads and bridges with the single biggest nonstarter for the other side. How should they proceed? That's a choice for the Democrats, whose pay-for is more popular, to make.\n\nYou may not have heard about it (and we may not have written about it [GRIMACE EMOJI]), but as the two parties fumble about trying to find if there's a bipartisan path forward on infrastructure, there's a real, live bipartisan bill addressing another pressing issue moving through the Senate. When Democrats, led by Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono, introduced a bill to stem hate crimes against Asian Americans a few weeks ago, it seemed like something that Republicans would filibuster for going too far, and then everyone would just yell at one another about who was to blame and they'd all fly home. Instead, a couple of teams of senators are working out bipartisan amendments to clean up certain differences, and now it's moving through the chamber. There may be more where that came from. This week, Sens. Chuck Schumer-who runs the joint-and Todd Young, the Republican senior senator from Indiana, paired up to introduced the Endless Frontier Act, designed to beef up competitiveness with China in advanced technology and manufacturing. Its co-sponsors span the full ideological gamut in both the Senate and the House, from South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham to New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman. So lawmakers are hoping to take it up in the coming months. Sure, fine, the process is working in some areas, blah blah, snooze. Back to the FIGHTS!\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy this week forced a vote to censure Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters for saying protesters in Minnesota should \"get more confrontational\" and \"make sure they know we mean business\" in the event of a not-guilty verdict in the Derek Chauvin trial. Not all House Democrats were exactly in love with Waters' comments, and their leaders could only afford a few defections. The situation was serious enough that Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer were each posted at the doors to the House chamber during the vote catching members on their way in. In the end, the censure resolution was killed, and an impressive zero Democrats broke ranks. It was a typically expert demonstration of lining up the votes from Pelosi and House Democratic leadership. After the Chauvin guilty verdict came in, though, Pelosi met her age-old foes: the microphone and the television camera. \"Thank you, George Floyd, for sacrificing your life for justice,\" she said, while looking upward to the sky. The entirety of the global population had been manned at their internet battle stations scouring for bad takes after the verdict to dunk on. And though the Las Vegas Raiders ultimately took the gold, Pelosi still made the podium.\n\nWe've spent a lot of time talking about what Congress can do, but so far haven't checked in on what Joe Manchin will allow it to do. This will be brief. The labor-backed PRO Act? Manchin says ... yes ??? Whoa. Now advocates just need to work on the likes of Sens. Mark \"Big Management Energy\" Warner and Kyrsten \"Fuck Off\" Sinema. Fifteen-dollar minimum wage? Not just going to not do it, but going to make fun of Bernie Sanders, in front of the restaurant lobby, for wanting to do it. On the other hand, he is with Biden on funding the infrastructure bill through corporate tax hikes instead of user fees, just so long as the corporate tax rate isn't above 25 percent. The filibuster? Still loves it.\n\nIn October 2017, veteran Ohio Rep. Pat Tiberi announced out of nowhere that he would retire before his term ended to take a job with the Ohio Business Roundtable. Life is a journey! We recalled this bit of trivia this week, when Ohio Rep. Steve Stivers announced out of nowhere that he would retire before his term ended to take a job with the Ohio Chamber of Commerce. Now technically, under the Ancient Rules of Trend Piece Writing, we are supposed to wait for, say, Ohio Rep. Bob Latta to quit midterm to take a job with, say, the Ohio Manufacturers' Association before declaring this a trend. But the Surge doesn't follow \"rules\"-what's that, officer? Turn the noise down? Yes, yes, sorry, oh my God so sorry, doing it now!-um, doesn't follow \"rules,\" and we're declaring \"going full Tiberi\" the hot new trend among Ohio Republican lawmakers. The move will also allow House Democrats to breathe just a bit: After several members left to join the Biden administration, and Florida Rep. Alcee Hastings died, Democrats' already-narrow margin had been narrowing further.\n\nWe began with Gosar, so let's just end with Greene. You may recall from earlier this spring when conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus began requesting roll-call votes on even the most uncontroversial of bills-so called suspension bills, as they're expedited under suspension of the rules-in part as a protest of the House voting to strip Greene of her committee assignments. This required members to be on the floor, instead of doing anything useful, for hours at a time for bills that would pass by 400-vote margins. But the House is not the Senate, and one person deciding for the first time to abuse a parliamentary procedure does not set a precedent that seizes up the chamber for decades: The House just changes its rules. This week, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern came up with a (for now, temporary) rule to vote on suspension bills for which roll-call votes were requested \"en bloc,\" rather than one at a time. Greene was outraged with the rule change. Ah, well.\n\nKeep up with what's going on in Washington with Slate's weekly political ranking, written by Jim Newell.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Paul Gosar Deprived His Fellow Republicans of the Only Silver Lining of Their Week\n\nBy early Wednesday afternoon, when Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar decided to weigh in on the matter, the discourse around Donald Trump's astonishing demand for a \"termination\" of all rules in the U.S. Constitution already seemed stale.\n\nThe previous day, the Trump Organization had been found guilty of a tax fraud scheme by the Manhattan district attorney's office; the House committee investigating Jan. 6 said it would issue criminal referrals to the Justice Department; and Democrat Raphael Warnock had won the Georgia Senate race.\n\nThe news cycle appeared to have shifted.\n\nThis likely came as a relief to some Republicans in Congress, who were eager to not have to comment on the latest rantings and ravings of their albatross . Especially because of what he was arguing: that a release of internal documents at Twitter showing employees doing content moderation around attacks on Hunter Biden was related to Trump's loss in the 2020 election-which, of course, he believes he won-and that this kind of \"Massive Fraud\" perpetrated by \"Big Tech Companies, the DNC, & the Democrat Party\" allowed \"for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution.\"\n\nTrump blasted \"the revelation of MASSIVE & WIDESPREAD FRAUD & DECEPTION\" on Truth Social, adding : \"Our great 'Founders' did not want, and would not condone, False & Fraudulent Elections!\"\n\nThis was awkward on several levels. The Republican Party has made it its mission to try to \"be\" the party of the Constitution. Originalists, a conservative sect of lawyers, claim to be beholden only to the laws of the Constitution (as they interpret them). Republican lawmakers often portray themselves as more loyal to the Founding Fathers than are their opponents, and are known to recite the Constitution on the House floor after winning a House majority, as they did this year. (In November, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy promised to do so \"on the very first day of the new Republican-led Congress,\" noting it was \"something that hasn't been done in years.\")\n\nSo Trump's remarks meant that Republicans spent days hemming and hawing, trying to simultaneously distance themselves from the sound bite without slamming Trump; downplay the sound bite's significance; and also stand up for their supposedly favorite document, the Constitution.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, for example, called the Constitution \"enduring\" but ignored reporters when they asked about Trump. Mike Pence told a South Carolina radio station that anyone who \"aspires to serve or to serve again\" should support the Constitution. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell waited more than three days to comment, and when he did, said: \"It would be pretty hard to be sworn in as to the presidency if you're not willing to uphold the Constitution.\"\n\nSteve Scalise pretended he hadn't heard what Trump had done, but said, about the Constitution: \"Next to the Bible, it's the most important document in the history of the world.\"\n\nIt's a tense moment. With Sen. Warnock's win in Georgia , the midterms of Trump meddling is officially a bust. His hand-picked candidates did very badly, blowing what could have been a red wave. Establishment Republicans are surely hoping that the average Republican primary voter will look at the data and decide it's time to move on from Trump-because he sure isn't ready to throw in the towel.\n\nThe only silver lining of the week, in fact, should have been that big news elsewhere would swamp any memory of Trump's Constitution hissy fit. But Paul Gosar, it seems, couldn't help but step in it.\n\nIn a since-deleted tweet on his official account, he wrote on Wednesday, four days after Trump's missive: \"I support and agree with the former president. Unprecedented fraud requires unprecedented cure.\"\n\nImpeccable timing!\n\nThis, of course, spurred a whole new slew of headlines from MSNBC , Rolling Stone , Axios , the New Republic , the Daily Beast , the Independent , the conservative Washington Examiner , and (multiple times over) the Arizona Republic. In a tweet , Rep. Liz Cheney called the deleted tweet to McCarthy's attention and asked the Republican House leader if it was \"time to condemn Trump yet.\"\n\nGosar is an extreme even among the Republican Party's right flank. He was stripped of committee assignments last year after appearing to threaten Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and he more recently appeared at a white nationalist event. This week, he clearly went unnecessarily off script, at a strangely unrushed moment. And his radical statement, followed by a quick walk back, showed just what a strange position Republicans have once again found themselves in with an anti-democratic figure as their leader-a leader they would surely love to see step aside.\n\nBut even Gosar could have saved himself some trouble by just checking the news. Because by the time he was backing Trump up, Trump had already disavowed his previous statement. On Monday, Trump wrote : \"The Fake News is actually trying to convince the American People that I said I wanted to 'terminate' the Constitution. This is simply more DISINFORMATION & LIES, just like RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA, and all of their other HOAXES & SCAMS.\"\n\nTrump's original post remains online.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Censure of Paul Gosar Matters\n\nIn late February, the internet was aflame with speculation that the shape of the stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Florida was a secret nod to the Nazis. Like most topics of conversation on the internet, this was a stupid waste of time. And the focus came with an important opportunity cost, as it buried a real story about a real sitting congressman, Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar.\n\nGosar had spent that same weekend, in the same city, attending and speaking at a shadow conference organized by white nationalists. Addressing the America First Political Action Conference, Gosar gave an anti-immigrant warmup speech to the conference's organizer, Nick Fuentes. Fuentes was at both the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol, and told the conference that they needed to protect America's \"white demographic core.\"\n\nA daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.\n\nGosar has spent much of the year toiling as a B-story to the shinier objects sowing mayhem on the right. Following Jan. 6, much of the focus for Trump's enablers landed on rally speakers like Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene-the shiniest object of all-or Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks or North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn. But it was Gosar who was most closely involved with the characters planning \"Stop the Steal\" rallies, starting with rallies in his home state of Arizona and building to the Ellipse rally in January. \"Once we conquer the Hill,\" Gosar said at a December rally in Arizona, \"Donald Trump is returned to being president.\"\n\nGosar faced no immediate punishment for that, nor for speaking at the white nationalist conference in February. In April, he was linked with an effort to start an America First Caucus in the House that, according to a draft memo, sought to defend \"a common respect for uniquely Anglo-Saxon political traditions\" and, among other things, call for an infrastructure that \"befits the progeny of European architecture.\" While his colleague in that since-abandoned effort to start the caucus, Greene, had already been punished by a House vote to strip her of her committee assignments for her history of conspiracy theories and threatening statements, Gosar just kept sliding. He maintained his standing on the Natural Resources Committee, a valuable résumé item for any member from Arizona.\n\nWhat finally brought Gosar to the forefront-and to the vote Wednesday to censure him and strip him of his committee assignments finally-was an edited anime video that he tweeted in early November.\n\nIt's not as if Gosar only began tweeting baffling material now. His feed has never read as well adjusted. But early last week, Gosar posted an altered anime video that depicts a likeness of himself stabbing a likeness of New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the neck and leaping with two swords at a likeness of President Joe Biden. It was, as he has tried to explain both in public statements and in awkward speeches to the House GOP conference, a metaphor for the need to address surges of immigrants at the border. The counter, though, is that he could've chosen a better metaphor to rail against the administration's border policies than one in which he kills a colleague who faces constant streams of death threats.\n\nGosar's initial statements responding to the firestorm were to explain the metaphor. \"The cartoon depicts the symbolic nature of a battle between lawful and unlawful policies and in no way intended to be a targeted attack against Representative Cortez or Mr. Biden,\" he said in a statement . \"It is a symbolic cartoon. It is not real life. Congressman Gosar cannot fly. The hero of the cartoon goes after the monster, the policy monster of open borders.\" He would later compare the calls for his punishment to the criticisms Charlie Hebdo magazine faced in 2015 for its depiction of the Prophet Mohammed, something which led to a massacre of the magazine's staff.\n\nAfter a chitchat with Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, though, Gosar ultimately took the video down. As he said in his floor speech Wednesday, ahead of the censure vote, \"I voluntarily took the cartoon down not because it was itself a threat, but because some thought it was. Out of compassion for those who generally felt offense, I self-censored.\"\n\nBut it wasn't just the cartoon. The decision to punish Gosar-a decision that one can only assume Democrats did not make on a whim, given that it is the first censure of a member since 2010-is inseparable from Jan. 6, Gosar's so-far-overshadowed role in the planning and hyping of the events of the day, and Democrats' heightened alert of violent rhetoric at the top of the Republican Party inspiring violent actions from elements of its base. At the censure proceedings, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer observed that \"piercing tweets become sharp knives, words bring out firearms, and cartoon killing begets real-life bloodshed.\" Florida Rep. Ted Deutch, the Ethics Committee chair, noted that \"just 10 months ago this chamber was attacked in an act of brutal, bloody savagery.\"\n\n\"The threat against members is real,\" he said, \"and it is growing.\"\n\nThere were few direct defenses of Gosar from Republicans. The typical GOP member's speech during the censure debate began with some throat-clearing that while they may not have posted that video, this censure was a sideshow, a distraction from the Democrats to cover for bigger problems under their watch like inflation, an overrun border, supply chain woes, and the withdrawal from Afghanistan. Texas Rep. Louis Gohmert said that while he watched the offending video in \"freeze frame,\" he still couldn't tell that Ocasio-Cortez was the one being stabbed. (Nevertheless, he said, \"if that was supposed to be her, that was really unfair.\") After the vote-which passed 223 to 207 with all Democrats and two Republicans, Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney, voting in favor-a dozen or so Freedom Caucus members stood with Gosar in solidarity, with Greene asking, to no one in particular, \"What about Eric Swalwell, sleeping with a Chinese spy?\" Numerous Republican speakers in their floor remarks said that censures of Democrats, and their removal from committees, will be flying when Republicans retake control of the chamber.\n\nCensures are essentially symbolic. It's a recorded reprimand from your colleagues for ethical transgressions. But members still treat a censure as grave punishment, a stain they can't rinse out. Perhaps that's because while a member who's censured is free, following the censure, to proceed with their normal job duties, they first have to undergo a medieval public shaming. The censured member must walk to the well of the House, before all of his colleagues, and have the resolution of censure read before them. For Gosar, this meant hearing about his \"threats of violence against the president of the United States and a fellow member of Congress.\"\n\nSpeaking of that member: Ocasio-Cortez, the target of Gosar's metaphor, spoke at the censure proceedings as well, saying that \"as leaders of this country, when we incite violence with depictions against our colleagues, that trickles down into violence in this country.\" As the vote was about to be gaveled shut, Ocasio-Cortez moved to the front row of the chamber, taking a prime seat to watch as Gosar, at long last, got the close-up he deserved.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Who Got What They Wanted?\n\nThe appointment of various members of Congress to various seats on committees-something that happens at the start of each new Congress-is typically not that interesting of a process. But then, this is not a typical Congress.\n\nRepublicans, back in the majority, are seeking to reinstate the committee assignments for two members, Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar and Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, whom Democrats had stripped of their assignments in the previous Congress. (Republicans are also looking for revenge by stripping a few Democrats of their assignments). And some members are fresh off of a very public standoff in which they used certain committee seats as a cudgel to bend McCarthy to their will in exchange for supporting him for speaker.\n\nTo be clear, committee assignments aren't officially set yet, even though we're a few weeks into the new Congress. First, the leaders of the respective parties have to cut a deal on committee ratios, and then each party's respective steering committee decides who goes where. That's where we are now. Next, each respective party caucus and conference will approve their steering committees' recommendations, and then the whole House has to sign off on them too.\n\nBut with most of the steering committee recommendations in, let's look at some of the notable placements.\n\nPaul Gosar and Marjorie Taylor Greene are back.\n\nFor a long time, the House majority wouldn't fiddle with the minority's committee selections. But they always could . After all, a majority can do whatever it wants with 218 votes. Twice in the last Congress, then, Democrats took a step that was unprecedented in modern times: They voted to strip two separate members of the minority from their committee assignments for incidents they found beyond the pale.\n\nIn February of 2021, barely into the new Congress, all Democrats (and 11 Republicans) voted to strip Greene from two committee assignments for a series of dingbat stunts and amping of conspiracy theories that occurred mostly before she got to Congress: \"liking\" Facebook posts about shooting then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi, dabbling in 9/11 trutherism, and confronting school shooting survivors.\n\nNine months later, Gosar was removed from his committees-and censured-for posting an anime video in which he was depicted killing New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking President Biden with swords. (Gosar and AOC, interestingly, were spotted having a floor conversation during this month's speakership ordeal.)\n\nMcCarthy pledged that each of these members of Congress would get their committee assignments back if Republicans retook the majority. They ran with that information in different ways. Greene became one of McCarthy's most loyal allies as he sought to corral the votes for the speakership, while Gosar was one of the 20 holdouts who didn't come around to McCarthy's side until the 12 th ballot.\n\nIt didn't appear to make a lick of difference. Gosar was still restored to the same committees from which he was removed-Natural Resources and Oversight. Greene also landed on Oversight, the committee that has wide latitude to investigate and make a spectacle of the Biden administration, as well as on Homeland Security, which has jurisdiction over happenings at the southern border. Neither of Greene's committees are going to produce major bipartisan legislation that unites America. But they will hold many televised hearings during which Greene can yell at Biden administration officials.\n\nWhat of the other McCarthy-speaker-vote holdouts?\n\nThere was a time, oh there was a time, when junior, backbench members wouldn't dare deny the speaker-in-waiting the gavel, because they knew they'd be lighting their careers on fire. That time was pretty recent. Former Rep. Kathleen Rice, for example, tried to topple Pelosi ahead of the 2019 speaker's vote. She failed at that, and then was mysteriously unable to secure the spot on the Judiciary committee for which she considered herself next in line.\n\nNowadays, Republican leaders would get in trouble with right-wing media if they tried to mete out consequences to annoying people. (That last sentence better explains the previous decade of politics more than anything else I've written.) So instead, several of the holdouts appear to have been rewarded with prized seats on so-called \"A\" committees, which are highly sought. Texas Rep. Michael Cloud and Georgia Rep. Andrew Clyde, both holdouts, won seats on Appropriations, while Tennessee Rep. Andy Ogles and Florida Rep. Byron Donalds, whom the holdouts nominated on numerous speakership ballots, will serve on Financial Services. Six of the holdouts will be on Oversight, and several others on Judiciary-the two prime spots for people who just want to heckle Joe Biden.\n\nOne line that was not crossed, though, was giving holdouts the specific committee or subcommittee chairmanships they asked for. Maryland Rep. Andy Harris reportedly wanted control of a powerful Appropriations subcommittee controlling health spending. He got a different subcommittee gavel. And Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz reportedly wanted a subcommittee chairmanship on Armed Services. He didn't get it.\n\nGeorge Santos won seats on the Siberia committees that meet in Siberia.\n\nThere was some outrage from Democrats that Republicans would deign to give assignments to George Santos, who's in the midst of a scandal in which he appears to have made up much of his life story. (This could have consequences beyond mere political shame.) The committees to which he was assigned, though, aren't universally recognized as power centers in the United States Congress. He will sit on the Small Business and Science, Space and Technology committees. Even if something \"cool\" does come along in science (which Santos invented, didn'tcha know?), he'll be too junior on the committee to have any say in it. Oh well! He shouldn't have made up so many lies.\n\nDid McCarthy punish any House Republicans?\n\nThere is one guy who thinks McCarthy screwed him. Florida Rep. Vern Buchanan lost the race to chair the Ways and Means Committee-the \"A\"-est of the \"A\" committees-to Missouri Rep. Jason Smith. Per Puck's reporting, Buchanan blamed McCarthy for siding with Smith and walked up to McCarthy on the floor to say, \"You fucked me, I know it was you, you whipped against me.\" Buchanan, a rich guy with a private plane who has better things to do than this, has reportedly been mulling retirement if he's not going to chair the committee. And that's part of why McCarthy moved this contested chairmanship decision until after he had Buchanan's vote for speaker.\n\nWhich Democrats are Republicans planning to kick off of committees?\n\nMcCarthy has sworn he will make good on a promise to remove California Reps. Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell, two villains of the Fox News universe, from their seats on the Intelligence committee in retaliation for their roles in Trump investigations. McCarthy also plans to boot Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar from Foreign Affairs. McCarthy could remove Schiff and Swalwell unilaterally as Intel is a select committee. Omar's removal from a standing committee would have to be done by House vote.\n\nWhat about the Rules committee?\n\nThis is the big one we're still waiting to see. McCarthy, as speaker, has the ability to appoint Republican members of the Rules committee, which sets the parameters for floor consideration of most major legislation. The speaker's control of this committee, which he typically stocks with the most loyal of allies, is a fundamental part of the speaker's control of the House. According to reporting of the deal McCarthy struck with far-right holdouts, though, conservatives in the Freedom Caucus (or fellow ideological travelers) are supposed to get three seats on the Rules Committee.\n\nThis has the potential to be one of McCarthy's most meaningful concessions. The breakdown on the Rules Committee is typically nine speaker-controlled warm bodies to four members from the minority. Giving three seats to the Freedom Caucus could leave McCarthy with only 6 remote-controlled McCarthy stans-i.e., a minority. McCarthy has yet to make his appointments here beyond the chairman, Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole, but it's worth paying close attention to the specific hardliners he lets in.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

Paul Gosar's nine siblings are taking a family feud to a whole new level, starring in a series of ads for their brother's Democratic opponent in November, David Brill. In the ads, Tim, David, Grace, Joan, Gaston, and Jennifer Gosar all speak directly to the camera and explain why they think their brother does not have the best interest of Arizona's 4th district . \"If he actually cared about people in rural Arizona, I bet he'd be fighting for Social Security, for better access to health care,\" Jennifer Gosar says in one ad.\n\nIn another ad, the siblings repudiate their brother's views and make clear they don't share his values . \"It would be difficult to see my brother as anything but a racist,\" Grace Gosar says in one of the ads. Joan Gosar, for her part, says at one point that her brother \"traded a lot of the values we had at our kitchen table.\"\n\nRep. Gosar responded to the ads on Saturday by criticizing his siblings but painting it as nothing more than a family squabble. \"You can't pick your family.  We all have crazy aunts and relatives etc and my family is no different,\" he wrote on Twitter . \"I hope they find peace in their hearts and let go all the hate.\" In another tweet, Gosar also characterized his siblings who spoke up as \" liberal Democrats who hate President Trump \" and called them \"disgruntled Hillary supporters\" who \"put political ideology before family.\"\n\nYou can't pick your family.

      "text": "\"Anglo-Saxon\" May Not Have Been the Best Branding for Marjorie Taylor Greene's New Caucus\n\nLate last week, Punchbowl News reported that Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar were about to launch something called the \"America First Caucus\" for Republican members of Congress who want to \"follow in President Trump's footsteps.\" In a strategic sense this was a good idea; Republican politics is still gravitationally attracted to Trump even though he mostly doesn't do anything , and while there is already a hard-right, Trumpist \"Freedom Caucus,\" there was an opening for a self-branded group to tie itself even more closely to his name and catchphrases. Embattled Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz and Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert, two clownish House guys whose instincts are good proxies for the instincts of the Republican primary electorate, said immediately that they'd be interested in joining.\n\nPunchbowl's scoop noted that a memo that was being circulated about the caucus's goals cited the purported importance of \"Anglo-Saxon political traditions\" to the America that is to be put First. Given that nonhistorians usually understand Anglo-Saxon to just mean white , and that Gaetz, Gohmert, Gosar, and Greene aren't known for their interest in the anthropology of the British Isles, members of the press and public surmised that America First was going to be an openly white nationalist faction.\n\nA daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.\n\nThis appears to be what Republican leaders believed as well, because House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and GOP conference chair Liz Cheney both obliquely criticized the idea immediately, then did whatever it is that's done to atom-bomb these kinds of things behind the scenes, to the point that Greene was issuing a statement on Saturday denouncing \"liars and psychotic left wing communists in the media\" for suggesting she had any connection to the caucus, or interest in endorsing it. (This despite her own spokesman having said proudly the previous day that the \"America First Caucus platform\" would be \"announced to the public very soon.\") The America First Caucus is, for now, dead.\n\nThe funny thing, though, is that most of the memo, which Vice posted in its entirety , might as well be an official statement of the Republican Party's current political strategy. It reads like the latest installment of the five-years-and-counting project by conservative intellectuals to create a coherent Trump doctrine, on the fly, that might reframe his reflexive ingroup-outgroup bullying as the expression of a respectable and (more) widely appealing theory about how government should work . As such, however-as an attempt to turn the things that come out of Donald Trump's mouth into something you might discuss in a college course-it bears certain strains.\n\nTheories of a more stable and enduring Trumpism generally imagine keeping the mood of grievance that fired up Trump's loyal base, while marrying it to the sort of material accomplishments that might convince nonfanatics to support the program. In its less convincing form, this leads to things like the America First manifesto calling for heavy investment in the nation's roads, bridges, and drinking water, while insisting on \"an infrastructure that reflects the architectural, engineering and aesthetic value that befits the progeny of European architecture.\"\n\nBut the document also makes arguments about free trade and corporate power that many liberals would agree with, arguing that offshoring has weakened the American middle and working classes, that major technology companies have too much control over cultural discourse, that using money for wars overseas instead of necessities at home is a waste, that climate change is a major threat, and that the U.S. education system mostly serves to retrench an existing elite. At the same time, though, and to a degree that almost seems self-aware, it either ignores or denounces any policy for dealing with those problems that has a hint of a connection to Democratic Party know-it-alls, dismissing the Green New Deal's clean-energy infrastructure spending for its alleged connection to \"social justice,\" attacking \"Keynesian\" economics, and arguing in favor of \"shrinking the regulatory state.\"\n\nAmong the action items the memo supports instead: restricting legal immigration to individuals who can contribute \"economically\" and show \"respect for this nation's culture,\" eliminating the Section 230 protection that prevents social media companies from being held liable for content that appears on their platforms, prohibiting coronavirus-related business closures, and pursuing alliances with Russia and North Korea. In other words, the document outlines a policy of tapping into the anger that voters have about big-business power and income inequality, but only actually doing stuff that is hostile to nonwhite immigrants and liberal-signifying people like public health experts, San Francisco tech executives, and the dweebs who are still upset that Russia's military intelligence units helped Donald Trump win an election.\n\nThe goal is to co-opt, but also to own, the libs. The challenge is that the co-optation can't involve Democratic ideas or people-and it has to be toothless enough so as not to upset the business interests who are still part of the Republican coalition-while the ownage has to be subtle enough not to alienate voters who don't want to think of themselves as supporting a white nationalist party. (The phrase \"America First,\" despite its fascist history, actually seems to have succeeded at the latter goal.)\n\nIt's a delicate balance, because Trump has proved that other parts of the coalition want explicit white nationalism, which is how you get the Anglo-Saxon incident (and also electoral results like \"losing the House, presidency, and Senate in quick succession\"). It would be convenient, for the Republican Party, if there were a benign, historically justified way to capture the identity of its core voters without making reference to racialized us vs. them conflicts specific to this time and place. But it is tricky, bordering on impossible, to argue that there is an actually deep, shared throughline of political philosophy, cultural heritage, and ethnicity that unites WASPS who hate the estate tax, Irish and Italian Americans who post Blue Lives Matter memes, right-wing Zionist Jews, and Cuban exiles who live in Texas. The party's best minds are working on the problem, but their worst minds keep crashing through the wall to put the race stuff front and center.\n\nIn the seven years I've been covering news and politics for Slate, I've written about some of the United States' best and worst moments, people, and ideas.

      "text": "The 16 Gangs That Rule American Politics\n\nIt's not just the presidency. It's an election year for the House and Senate too, and all the coalitions on Capitol Hill will be scrapping for power-loudly, probably. Here's our guide to some of the most prominent archetypes in Congress (and slightly beyond), a compendium of the kinds of characters that will surely be popping up in campaigns throughout the coming year.\n\nTo be clear, these are very much identities that we made up. Congress itself is divided by caucuses within political parties, but those caucus names usually don't mean much. For example: The Problem Solvers Caucus ... doesn't really solve problems. The Freedom Caucus is just the most extreme right-wingers and Kevin McCarthy-ousters. In the Senate, the radical flanks are smaller and less powerful-but we've identified the pirates most prone to mutiny anyway.\n\nSome archetypes are (somewhat shockingly, given the nature of our era) bipartisan. Many apply to politicians in both the House and Senate, and some people can be slotted into multiple, overlapping categories. But all are part of the circus that is our relatively ineffective legislative branch. Cheers to another election year! It's just getting started, so get comfortable, wherever you may sit.\n\nIllustrations by Natalie Matthews-Ramo/Slate\n\nExamples: Kari Lake, Paul Gosar, Eli Crane\n\nPolitical A﻿ffiliation: Republican\n\nThe most dangerous political figures in the country are coming out of one state: Arizona. The desert heat is producing a bizarre mix of white nationalist ideology , gun fetishism , election denialism , general conspiracymongering , and goofy personalities . That might sound common in the Trump age, but the Arizona version is quite special. The state GOP is the vanguard of the most intense elements of the Trumpist right: scary not only for a common desire to simply not count votes (unless they win), but also for the constant subtext of threatened violence that underlies the anti-democratic turn.\n\nAgain, in the Jan. 6 era, that may sound basic , but the Arizona version is not. (Just look at the dominant political figures of the post-McCain GOP in Arizona to see what I'm talking about.) This era's Desert Weirdos come from odd, frankly interesting backgrounds. There's Rep. Paul Gosar, the dentist once beloved by patients for his gentle approach, whom Slate's Jim Newell has described as \" the actual worst member of Congress \" for his blatant ethno-nationalism and violent ideation about killing his political opponents . (Gosar is so bad that every couple of years , several of his own siblings try, unsuccessfully, to unseat him.) There's 2024 Senate candidate and failed 2022 gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake, the decadeslong Phoenix TV news fixture known for her warmth on camera and LGBTQ+ friendships, who decided that the 2020 election had been stolen from Trump and that her former colleagues were bad guys , and who now rails against drag queens and rainbow flags. There's Rep. Eli Crane, the former Navy SEAL who made his fortune selling \" once fired ammunition made into bottle openers \" after going on Shark Tank and now talks about \" colored people \" on the House floor. Even the relatively normal figures in this group have wild backstories. Andy Biggs, the far-right former Freedom Caucus leader who challenged Kevin McCarthy for the House speakership at the start of 2023, is a boring old lawyer, but he got his start in politics after winning $10 million in a 1993 sweepstakes sponsored by Dick Clark and Ed McMahon.\n\nThe Weirdos are easily explained as an (almost entirely) white backlash to one of the most rapidly diversifying and Democratic-moving states in the country after decades of Republican dominance. (Though, to be fair, the Arizona Republicans have always kept it weird .)\n\nWhen people picture these Desert Weirdos, they probably have a couple of different visions. For the men, it's Mark Finchem, the former secretary of state candidate and walking, talking walrus mustache and cowboy hat, whose entire candidacy was premised on the promise that he would not count votes accurately. For the women, it's Lake, with her pixie cut, newscaster makeup, perfectly composed look, and tendency to start yelling in your face at the drop of a hat.\n\nThe better visual, though, may be that of the failed Senate candidate, 2024 House candidate , and Peter Thiel acolyte Blake Masters, whose 2022 campaign ad prompted comparisons to a school shooter : The chilling vision of Masters creepily grinning as he proudly fires his Walther PPK-with a silencer-alone in the middle of the desert, whispering about how \"quiet it is,\" how it's \"made in Germany,\" and how it's \"just a little bit warm,\" is a haunting reminder that the Desert Weirdos may seem fun, but they are way scarier than that. - Jeremy Stahl\n\nExamples: Mitch McConnell, Dick Durbin, Nancy Pelosi, Jim Clyburn\n\nPolitical Affiliation: Bipartisan\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is 81. Sen. Dick Durbin is 79. Sen. Chuck Grassley is 90. Rep. Nancy Pelosi is 83. (So is Jim Clyburn.) And when she died in September, still casting her vote in precipitously collapsing health , Dianne Feinstein was 90. The youngest of these powerful figures were born during World War II, and all have held on to power for decades. Congress functions, at the actually getting-things-done level, on seniority and experience, and these particular lawmakers have amassed the power to get things done, in part, by just being around for so long. It's hard to get a leadership position on a good committee without half a dozen terms under your belt. And it makes sense that people such as Pelosi-still considered a power broker, even though she's no longer the Democratic leader-would have the chops for both intraparty and cross-aisle negotiations. She took office the same month Ronald Reagan challenged Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall. She's been around, and she's seen a lot of squabbles.\n\nAnd yet, there's something odd about the sheer number-a full 20!-of octogenarian (and nonagenarian) federal legislators. Not to mention, the president of the U.S. is 81. (The front-runner of the opposition party is 77.) Having increasing numbers of very old lawmakers prompts the question: Why won't these people retire? Surely it's more enjoyable to read novels and spend time with grandchildren than to scrap with culture war hotheads or stay up late into the night to hash out a vote. There seems to be a curious stubbornness that takes over the most powerful members of Congress in their later years, and the result can be ugly. It was painful watching Feinstein's decline. McConnell's \"freezing\" episodes and Biden's confused speeches have been similarly upsetting. But on a less personal level, they block off avenues for the younger generation to grow. Left with scraps, greener politicians have stuck to the arenas where they can do more: social media rants and semi-belligerent TV hits. We can't blame the firebrands' behavior fully on the oldest generation's hogging of power, but we can wonder what would happen if those old-timers ceded some responsibility to the fresh-faced fifty- and sixty-somethings instead. -Molly Olmstead\n\nExamples: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, Cori Bush\n\nPolitical Affiliation: Democrat\n\nFor most of Joe Biden's presidency, the so-called Squad of leftist House Democrats was more reliably in his corner than were many more moderate members-which was ironic, given that Biden had been one of the party's most prominent centrists during his decades in Congress. Rep. Ocasio-Cortez et al. were ready, for instance, to vote for Biden's Build Back Better bill, even after it was cut down significantly in order to reduce its cost; it was the moderates who'd pushed for the cuts in the first place who ultimately let the bill die .\n\nIsrael's assault on Gaza has changed those dynamics. Biden's reflexive instinct has been to support the Israeli military first and ask questions about collateral death tolls and humanitarian consequences later, a position that many younger-skewing Democrats believe amounts to enabling genocide . The members of the Squad have criticized Israel's response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack as indiscriminate and called for an immediate cease-fire, a position that puts them at odds with Biden and even with other figures on the left . (Bernie Sanders, for example, initially backed a \"humanitarian pause\" that acknowledges Israel's \"right to defend itself.\")\n\nThis has accelerated the already robust efforts of legacy pro-Israel donor organizations like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and Democratic Majority for Israel to support pretty much anyone running against a progressive in a Democratic primary this year. Tlaib, Bush, Omar, Pennsylvania Rep. Summer Lee, and New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman already have what the Intercept's Ryan Grim described as \" credible challenges \" in their 2024 races, and DMFI and other pro-Israel groups have already begun running attack ads that highlight these politicians' positions on Gaza. In other words, the Democratic Party is back to its usual condition of being in a fight with itself. -Ben Mathis-Lilley\n\nExamples: Gavin Newsom, Ron DeSantis, Chris Christie\n\nPolitical Affiliation: Bipartisan\n\nAmbitious and obsessed with appearing aggressive, these politicians know the solution to all America's political problems, and it's a forceful sparring of wits, delivered from astride a lectern, televised on a national stage. Gavin Newsom is the termed-out governor of California and not currently running for office; Ron DeSantis has precious few days to save his Republican presidential campaign. Yet the two of them booked a prime-time slot on Fox News at the end of last year for their own private slugfest, with Fox's Sean Hannity moderating. Why? Chris Christie got in the 2024 race specifically to debate Trump, which never happened. Why? Rep. Ro Khanna and Vivek Ramaswamy duked it out in New Hampshire. Why, why, why?\n\nThere are \"Debate Me\" Bros on both sides of the aisle, and some, somehow, are even more annoying than others. Ted Cruz, obviously, comes to mind-a somewhat theatrical individual who excelled in high school and college debate. (Hard to believe it, but he showed up to Washington that annoying.) Debate team alums litter American politics.\n\nIt's a nice idea that an evenhanded, old-fashioned exchange of ideas will yield a clear philosophical winner, clarify political strategy, or produce new ideas for solving the myriad problems we have-democratic deliberation made easy.\n\nBut as anyone who has ever participated in debate knows-and all of these politicians have-that is not remotely how debate is taught. Often, positions are assigned at random, and the ideas are subordinate to a ruthless arbitraging of the rules. Packing as many words as possible into the allotted time window is usually tantamount to victory. It's a battle of who can be louder or more easily perceived. If only anything were that straightforward. -Alexander Sammon\n\nExamples: Josh Hawley, J.D. Vance, occasionally Marco Rubio\n\nPolitical Affiliation: Republican\n\nWho needs the Chamber of Commerce? These Republicans would like to be known as populists and for the GOP to be called \" the party of the working class ,\" and they'll sometimes, sometimes even make the legislative commitments to back that up.\n\nBut broadly speaking, the members of this faction are well educated-Vance has a degree from Yale Law, and Hawley studied abroad at Oxford-and have, through their studies, come to believe in a form of conservatism that prioritizes the so-called traditional family. This itself isn't new in Republican politics, but what is original is combining \"family values\" rhetoric with the kind of economic ideas that Donald Trump campaigned on, like the protection of Social Security and Medicare spending, attacks on the power (and supposed liberalism) of large corporations, and protectionist tariffs on Chinese-made goods. They've also pushed Republicans who are willing to countenance a path-to-citizenship immigration compromise (they used to exist !) almost completely out of the party. The idea, in theory, is that all of these economic policies, when combined with the party's traditional social conservatism, will make it easier for regular working folks to thrive and be fecund.\n\nIn many ways-with the major exception of policy toward migrants-these positions, on the fiscal side, overlap with those of left-leaning Democrats. The question, then, becomes how far Hawley et al. are willing to go to actually use power to enact their positions, given that their donors still tend to believe, with a laudable commitment to principle, in the ideals of lower taxes and less regulation. The tax cuts that Trump himself signed into law, for example, did very little for the working class.\n\nOn that front, Hawley and Vance have in fact collaborated with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren on proposed banking regulations . And both said, during the United Auto Workers' recent strike, that autoworkers deserve higher wages , which is something , but it falls short of stating that workers should have an unencumbered right to organize. Trad Chads are also adamantly anti-\"woke,\" which means rejecting the idea that the kinds of structural forces that oppress the working poor also hold down the economic prospects of people of color. Vance also periodically enjoys attacking women who work outside the home and other alleged members of the \"childless left.\" Which is to say: They are still, after all, partisan Republicans. -B.M.L.\n\nExamples: RFK Jr., Vivek Ramaswamy, Marjorie Taylor Greene\n\nPolitical Affiliation: Bipartisan\n\nOpportunism comes in all shapes and sizes. But when it comes to American politics, the most unrelenting opportunists are often loud, rapacious, and completely inexhaustible. These are the people who will run for any office, regardless of experience or merit; seek any level of attention or notoriety, no matter how shameful; post embarrassing videos of themselves doing pushups or chin lifts or CrossFit to show off their physical prowess; and happily scapegoat vulnerable populations of people to boost their profiles and win unwell people to the cause. Because the only cause that matters? It's them.\n\nHeat-seeking missiles for clout, virality, and power, more and more, these politicians traffic in the most extreme conspiracy theories-the ones that would be absolutely ridiculous if the stakes weren't so high-because it gets them the most attention.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene gained prominence in part by harassing a teenage survivor of a school shooting on the streets of D.C., calling him \"#littleHitler.\" Vivek Ramaswamy is using GOP presidential debates to rattle off conspiracy theories about 9/11 and Jan. 6, along with supposed nefarious and secret plots to destroy white people, seemingly without taking a breath. And it's hard to know where to start with all the horrendous and absurd ideas RFK Jr. is pushing during his quixotic third-party campaign for the White House. (A typical political stance: accusing Fauci of masterminding \"a historic coup d'état against Western democracy.\")\n\nThe most recognizable of this era's chaos monsters are Donald Trump's heirs-attempting to embody populist sentiment through circuslike antics and dangerous fearmongering. But they aren't beholden to any one ideology. (And OK, fine, they don't all post about exercise.) Just look at New York Rep. Elise Stefanik-a Paul Ryan protégée who found Trumplightenment and went whole-hog MAGA, with all the warts-who found herself this year conveniently outraged about antisemitism on elite college campuses. It didn't matter that she had previously endorsed a congressional candidate who once described Hitler as \"the kind of leader we need today.\" She's managed to find a spotlight on a hot-button issue and boy, oh boy, is she dancing in it. - Natalie Shutler\n\nExamples: Chuck Schumer, Pramila Jayapal, Ron Wyden, Rosa DeLauro\n\nPolitical Affiliation: Democrat\n\nOn rare occasions, Joe Biden goes Dark Brandon mode . By that, we mean that he dispenses with pageantry and piety of norms and consensus, shunts Congress aside, and pushes through aggressive, party-line successes. These are fleeting glimpses. But the man who was once pilloried as a Republican-hugging moderate has, at times, seemed like an entirely different man.\n\nFor example, in his 2023 State of the Union, when Biden clashed with congressional Republicans so openly that they booed and cheered him from the audience. In his attempt to cancel student loan debt by executive order. In his landmark party-line climate bill, and his willingness to remake the courts with largely left-leaning judges. He has defied Republicans and norms alike in installing a devoutly pro-worker labor secretary, and leaving her in the role even though she doesn't have the votes to be formally confirmed. (This is, it must be noted, the stuff that Biden is best liked for by voters.)\n\nBehind all of this has been a group of progressive politicians that make up the biggest Democratic coalition in Congress and are led by Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal, who has found herself targeted for censure by congressional Republicans-hardly a Biden-style aisle-spanner. When it comes to getting Biden's actual agenda passed, it is progressives who have been his most loyal stalwarts, holding the line, drawing up the policy, and whipping the votes to get it done. Some of these are lifelong progressives; others seem to have had a left-leaning epiphany since Joe took office.\n\nThat unlikely alliance has become uneasy or worse since Biden has reverted to a foreign policy deferential to Benjamin Netanyahu, pledging unconditional support for the Israeli invasion of Gaza and going around Congress repeatedly to facilitate weapons transfers to Israeli. The congresspeople he is going around to facilitate his unpopular foreign policy are the very same ones who secured his popular domestic policy. Is the sun setting on Dark Brandon? -A.S.\n\nExamples: John Thune, John Barrasso, John Cornyn\n\nPolitical Affiliation: Republican\n\nMitch McConnell is the longest-serving Senate leader, of either party, ever. His dominance has been hard to overstate. From his influence over the Senate Leadership Fund, the juggernaut super PAC that supports Senate Republican campaigns, to shaping the Supreme Court's current conservative makeup-a project that started in 2016, when he refused to hold a vote for Merrick Garland, Obama's nominee to replace Antonin Scalia-McConnell has succeeded in reshaping large swaths of American political reality according to his conservative vision.\n\nHis closest associates are Senate Minority Whip John Thune, former Whip John Cornyn, and Senate GOP conference chairman John Barrasso, and each has been considered as a potential replacement for McConnell when he experiences a health issue (the latest being the \"freeze-ups\"). But Mitch doesn't seem to be going anywhere. He's proved to have an ironclad grip on his conservative coalition, despite his tussles with Donald Trump and a few recent (and easily squashed) challenges.\n\nRick Scott, for example, tried to challenge McConnell for his Senate minority leader post ahead of the 2022 midterm elections and failed, in a decisive 37-to-10 vote. Even if the GOP Conference airs its grievances with McConnell from time to time, the intraparty bickering hasn't seemed to weaken McConnell's influence. He fundraised a whopping $50 million in August alone for 2024 Republican races.\n\nIn an interview with CNN , McConnell shared that he's been working behind the scenes to get his \"preferred candidates in key races\" in order to prevent a repeat of the GOP's major 2022 midterm losses. He's dodged questions about Trump, staying strictly focused on winning back the Senate. It's typical McConnell form: saying very little but doing a whole lot.\n\nBut things could change in a hurry. McConnell's health scares, and his unwavering support for Ukraine aid in a party that's turning away from the cause, have called into question the future of his leadership after the 2024 elections. And if he does decide to hang it up after November? Let the Game of Johns begin. -Shirin Ali\n\nExamples: John Fetterman, Ruben Gallego, Maxwell Frost\n\nPolitical Affiliation: Democrat\n\nEver since Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential run inspired his youthful supporters to create a \" Dank Meme Stash \" on Facebook, savvy Democratic politicians often aligned with progressive causes have Gone Online to ask their fellow kids how they're doing. In 2020 Sen. Ed Markey fended off his primary challenger-a young Kennedy!-by memeing himself into winning the youth vote . John Fetterman's memes undoubtedly raised his national profile during his 2022 Senate race against celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz. And of course, the ever-expanding members of the Squad have leveraged Twitter and Instagram to build durable profiles , surpassing their longer-serving colleagues in national reach . Others are following suit, including freshman North Carolina Rep. Jeff Jackson, who regularly racks up millions of views on his TikToks even when he's digging into wonky topics like the defense budget.\n\nSometimes, the efforts can come off as desperate. (I still wince thinking of the moment when meme-happy Sens. Brian Schatz, Chris Murphy, and Chuck Schumer \"debated\" whether to retweet a Cardi B video.) But the instinct is a sensible one, considering the stark age gap between the party's geriatric leadership and the youth the party needs to turn out this year. This strategy is also increasingly necessary. Social media platforms are where youth activists organize around the issues that matter most to them: climate change , government censorship , the staggering death tolls in Gaza. Heck, for better or worse, TikTok's where many of the youngs get their news these days, whatever their ideological leaning.\n\nOf course, it's about not just being on the right platforms, but using them the right way. The Biden administration's outreach to TikTok influencers has not stanched Gen Z disappointment with his presidency. And there's brewing discontent with the meme-weaponizing Fetterman as his policies become less and less progressive. Still, youth turnout proved a deciding factor in both 2020 and 2022, an electoral advantage for Democrats that buoys them ahead of their tryhard Republican opponents. In 2024 it may be up to People of Memes like Sanders, Jackson, and AOC to not only keep up Democrats' digital strategy, but use it to show Gen Z they mean what they say. -Nitish Pahwa\n\nExamples: Lindsey Graham, Ritchie Torres, John Fetterman\n\nPolitical Affiliation: Bipartisan\n\nEven after a long, arduous day of representing their home states and districts, these lawmakers always have a little extra in reserve to look out for the state of Israel. Or rather, to advance the agenda of the country's far-right government, at basically any cost.\n\nThis was true before the horrific Oct. 7 Hamas attack and devastating war in Gaza, but current events have made this coterie of American politicians much more vocal in its unconditional support.\n\nSeemingly few things unite this coalition. There are Republicans. There are Democrats. They are geographically disparate. Neither being Jewish nor having a large Jewish constituency seems to have anything more than a passing causal relationship to membership. One of its most vituperative members, New York Democrat Ritchie Torres, is not Jewish and represents an extremely poor district that is overwhelmingly Black and Latino, with very few Jewish constituents.\n\nOne thing that does unite these legislators is the money they take from Israel-affiliated lobbying groups, including the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which has in recent years embraced the Republican Party with zeal. In 2022 those lobbying groups ponied up millions of dollars to knock former synagogue president and progressive Democrat Andy Levin out of Congress. Levin's great infraction was championing a two-state solution, which is written about favorably on AIPAC's website, if you make it past the photo montages of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Speaker Mike Johnson, both dear friends of the operation.\n\nDuring a rancorous 2023, when Congress accomplished nothing-it was literally the least productive congressional year in modern history-and even Republicans couldn't agree on much, most of the very few things that got passed were resolutions pledging unconditional support for Israel and censuring those who felt otherwise. It was an act of partisan tribute beyond D and R-all House Republicans (except, sometimes, Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie), teaming up with at least 22 House Democrats, to go after university presidents, pledge allegiance to Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing government, and censure the House's sole Palestinian American, Rashida Tlaib. If there's anything close to a functioning House majority in this Congress, it's this. -A.S.\n\nExamples: Matt Gaetz, Lauren Boebert, Marjorie Taylor Greene\n\nPolitical Affiliation: Republican\n\nIt's well known that right-wing media outlets, particularly Fox News, have changed the way the Republican Party works in the 21 st century, pushing the party's voters toward a conspiracy-theory mindset that perceives any cooperation with Democrats as betrayal. More recently, the ecosystem on sites such as Reddit, Facebook, and YouTube-not to mention the more extreme message boards that birthed QAnon-has cultivated a cohort of conservatives who interpret and communicate about the world and its events essentially through edgy memes and livestreamed diatribes.\n\nSome of those conservatives end up in Congress. And when they get there, they realize that being in Congress isn't super fun all the time. The fundraising obligations are enormous, the committee meetings are interrupted only for subcommittee meetings, and have you ever thought about how long it takes 435 people to hold a roll-call vote? Which is why there is now a sizable contingent of Republican members who put much more energy into posting on social media, doing online interviews, and submitting stunt \"messaging\" bills that have no chance of passing than they do into any real legislative activities-even the steps, like proposing budget reductions, tax cuts, and enhancements to national security and law enforcement, that appealed to prior generations of hard-liners.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz may have pioneered this approach by launching a thrice-weekly podcast and single-handedly shutting down the government in 2013 because Barack Obama rejected his demand to repeal Obamacare. Bygone Rep. Madison Cawthorn described this cohort's philosophy most honestly when he said he had built his staff \"around comms\"-i.e., communication-\"rather than legislation.\" These days, this coalition's leading lights are Gaetz and Greene, who have never met a feud that they won't pursue at length on Twitter or on Steve Bannon's podcast, or a hopeless demand to impeach someone or other that they won't support. -B.M.L.\n\nExamples: Jim Clyburn, Hakeem Jeffries, Chris Coons\n\nPolitical Affiliation: Democrat\n\nThese politicians are Biden's very own, the most mainstreamcore Democrats, avatars of the kind of middle-of-the-road liberalism that Biden himself has embodied at earlier stages of his very long career in Washington. Fiscally moderate, they'll push for, say, more-egalitarian tax credits and more subsidies for private health care but never say a mean word about the business sector or private insurance firms. They're also forever torn between the countervailing urges to fight with Republicans and fight with the left flank of their own party, the latter of which they find most irresistible.\n\nWhen Biden's teaming up with Republicans to pass marginal legislation on infrastructure, or even more marginal bipartisan measures on gun control, or somehow even more marginal legislation on voting rights, then it's all \"Woohoo, we love Biden.\" When he's preaching about good Republicans and the value of working across the aisle, it's more of the same. When he's making avuncular off-the-cuff remarks that might be insulting to activists or minorities in the party, well, that's just our gaffe-y guy.\n\nBut when Biden's pushing for tax increases or canceling student debt, advocating for aggressive climate spending or heading off to a picket line? There's a whole lot of grumbling.\n\nOne particularly poignant example comes from Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, Biden's understudy and confidant. When the $15 federal minimum wage came up for a vote in the Senate in 2021 as part of Biden's American Rescue Plan Act, Coons joined up with all 50 Senate Republicans (and seven Senate Dems) to cast down the proposal, which would certainly have been Biden's signature policy success.\n\nThese moderates expected to rein supreme in Biden's Washington, but that hasn't really happened, in part because their policy ambition is so limited, and in part because some of the moderates in Biden's own brain trust have, to borrow a phrase, gone Dark (Brandon). -A.S.\n\nExamples: Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Don Bacon\n\nPolitical Affiliation: Republican\n\nSome Republicans are anxious about the health of our democratic institutions. They're concerned . And these Very Concerned Republicans-all moderates from swing districts and states-have for years insisted that they are the adults in the room, impervious to whatever forces compel their colleagues to sling insults and act cruelly and take rhetoric and policy to divisive extremes. But these pearl-clutchers haven't always stood by what they say they believe, and certainly haven't been the Republican heroes so many Democrats hoped for.\n\nThey can be surprising, sure. Sen. Susan Collins voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, and she voted to acquit Trump during his first impeachment trial. Yet she was the only Republican to vote against confirming Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court in 2020, and she did vote to convict Trump during his second impeachment trial. Sen. Lisa Murkowski was slightly less trustworthy for Republicans. She voted against Kavanaugh, and she too voted to convict Trump in his second impeachment. Another \"reasonable\" voice, South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace, who worked on Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, signed a letter opposing the challenging of the 2020 election results and later called on Trump to condemn the Jan. 6 insurrection. Still, she voted against impeaching Trump. (She also voted against expelling George Santos.) Rep. Don Bacon voted both for the expulsion of Santos and for the creation of the Jan. 6 committee, but he opposed both efforts to impeach Trump.\n\nNow, without a Trump presidency, and with a Democrat-led Senate, their professed moral clarity, and the question of how genuine it is, doesn't seem quite as urgent. They may claim to despise the Freedom Caucus, but they don't do much to hinder them. And compared with the Marjorie Taylor Greenes, Matt Gaetzes, and Ted Cruzes of Congress, these Republicans seem like relatively normal human beings. In that way, they are still \"the adults in the room\"-kind of. They are still concerned , but they can't (or won't) seem to make anyone else grow up. -M.O.\n\nExamples: Henry Cuellar, Joe Manchin, Kyrsten Sinema\n\nPolitical Affiliation: \"Bipartisan\"\n\nHere's a riddle: What do you call a politician who takes money from Republican megadonors, advocates for Republican policy positions, and casts aspersions on Democratic politicians and sometimes even Democratic voters, causing all manner of problems for the Democratic Party? A Problem Solver, of course! At least, that's what these politicians call themselves in the House. In reality, the Problem Solvers Caucus self-identification is laden with irony.\n\nNo legislative improvement is too small to derail, no voter priority important enough to take seriously-unless, of course, that voter is a lobbyist. The country's most ghoulish financial buccaneers, these politicians won't work toward any goal-for some, enshrining the right to abortion; for others, lowering prescription drug prices-that might mildly inconvenience the corporate class. And their audacity flows like corporate cash.\n\nDean Phillips, fresh off three terms as a nameless backbencher in the House, is going straight for the Democratic presidency. Elissa Slotkin is going for Michigan's Senate seat. Josh Gottheimer has designs on a Governor's Mansion. And Joe Manchin, who has announced he won't run again for his Senate seat, is teasing a presidential run too.\n\nWhat little Democratic voters know of these Democratic politicians, they abhor. They manage even to work against one another-when Manchin wanted more expansive drug pricing reform, Kyrsten Sinema said no; when Sinema wanted a wealth tax, Manchin said no, and so we, the American public, got neither. But they've got one thing that unites them, and that's a desire to appear as mavericks. Many are affiliated with the avowedly moderate advocacy group No Labels, which benefits from the beneficence of Renaissance-style GOP benefactor Harlan Crow. When he's not commissioning oil paintings of Republican operatives, himself, and Clarence Thomas, or casting his sculpture garden of dictators, he (and others of his ilk) is taking out the pen and signing checks that filter down to these obstructionist politicians. -A.S.\n\nExamples: Marie Gluesenkamp Pérez, Mary Peltola, Jared Golden\n\nPolitical Affiliation: Democrat\n\nThis small but conspicuous faction of Democrats dabbles in obstructionism, bucking the party's agenda to different degrees because they represent the most conservative Democrat-held districts. Officially, the coalition is called the Blue Dog Democrats, and the caucus includes members like newcomer millennial Marie Gluesenkamp Pérez, who narrowly won her race against election denier Joe Kent in Washington in the 2022 midterm election cycle, and Mary Peltola, who beat out former Gov. Sarah Palin in 2022 for Alaska's sole House seat-the first time a Democrat had won it in half a century.\n\nThis group can be maddening to other Democrats in safer seats. Gluesenkamp Pérez, for example, positioned herself as moderately progressive in her campaign, yet, six months into her term, had already voted against her party more than any other Democrat, as Slate's Alexander Sammon wrote, including on abortion rights, student debt relief, and criminal justice reform.\n\nMaine Rep. Jared Golden is another Blue Dog, holding a hypercompetitive seat that he won by campaigning on being an \"independent voice\" in Congress. He voted against Democrats' gun control bill in 2019, then publicly reversed course after 18 in his district were killed in a mass shooting. He's also gone against his party on police reform, COVID-19 relief packages, and President Biden's Build Back Better plan-but is supportive of abortion rights. (Go figure.)\n\nPeltola, whose campaign slogan was \" Pro-Fish, Pro-Family, and Pro-Freedom ,\" breaks most conspicuously with Democrats on oil and supports the controversial Willow project , a major drilling venture on Alaska's North Slope that many climate activists oppose.\n\nAll three of these Democrats narrowly won their seats in surprising upsets but don't hold a deep loyalty to the party, which is likely what got them elected. Their seats will be among Republicans' top targets for pickups in 2024, and every successive election, for as long as they can cling on. -S.A.\n\nExamples: Rick Scott, Rand Paul, Mike Lee\n\nPolitical Affiliation: Republican\n\nIn the House, the right-wing Freedom Caucus, led by such illustrious members as Lauren Boebert, Chip Roy, and Jim Jordan, has established itself as very good at making everyone's lives hard. The group almost drove the country into a shutdown in its ferocious determination to win power in the battle over House leadership-seemingly just for sport. The Freedom Caucus, pain that it is to centrist Republicans, has teeth. It threw Kevin McCarthy overboard, after all, and held together enough to keep people it saw as too \"establishment\" out of the speaker's chair. Which might make one wonder: Where's the Senate version?\n\nWell, it kind of exists, but in a much more anemic form. There is a small group of Senate Republicans who have consistently tried to wage their troll-ish culture war campaigns to challenge McConnell from the right. Rand Paul, for example, harassed Anthony Fauci over the government's COVID protection measures; urged protesting truckers to take over D.C. streets; tripped up aid to Ukraine; and went after McConnell personally, casting doubt on McConnell's medical claims after his freezing episodes. Rick Scott, perhaps McConnell's most irritating nuisance, got his party into trouble when he floated cutting Social Security and also launched a failed leadership challenge to McConnell. Josh Hawley has kicked up a fuss about transgender athletes in college sports, but he's put much more energy into defending the Jan. 6 insurrection. (Same with Mike Lee and Ron Johnson, who's also happy to push Hunter Biden conspiracy theories.) Ted Cruz, something of his own (widely loathed) figure in the Senate, has, among other things, taken on Bud Light over its sponsorship of a trans influencer.\n\nIf it seems as if these moves are a halfhearted echo of the House's conflicts, it's partially because the House is just better at being messy and loud and insulting, but also because the numbers don't give these Senate Republicans much power. It takes a majority of the whole House to elect a speaker, giving a small band of misfits effective veto power over the chamber's leader. But Senate party leaders are elected by simple majorities of their own caucuses. So while McConnell has his antagonists who'd love to see him gone, they have nowhere near the numbers to oust him. When Scott ran against McConnell, he garnered 10 votes to McConnell's 37-likely an uncomfortably high number for the minority leader, but well short of the number needed to topple him. -M.O.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "How the Right-Wing Smear That the Texas Shooter Was a Trans Woman Spread So Fast\n\nThe hours after a catastrophic event are filled with chaos, as conflicting information emerges and people grab onto whatever information they can find. It's an environment where misinformation can thrive, where people share and retweet with panic and where responsible media outlets can't fact check enough to distribute reliable information to the public After the Uvalde shooting, a lie about the shooter's identity made it from one of the most wretched corners of the internet to a member of Congress' personal Twitter account within hours.\n\nThe shooter (whose name I will not use) at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, was killed around 12:45 p.m. Central Time on Tuesday. His name was released at a press conference at 4 p.m. Within a few hours, several people on 4chan had begun posting linking to the Reddit profile of a trans woman, suggesting she was the shooter. There was no evidence for this; several 4chan posters even commented that the photos didn't look like the other photos of the shooter floating around. Nevertheless, others picked the story up and ran with it.\n\nThe posts got traction on 4chan for a few reasons. First, content on 4chan is organized by recency, so having an active thread that people are responding to increases the visibility of the information, even if the person who posted it is just a random anonymous user. Second, the content is subject to basically no moderation; 4chan has a small moderation team and a junior \"janitor\" team that provides maintenance, but relative to the massive moderation departments of the major media platforms, there's very little there. Third, the board has a long culture of trolling and posting misinformation. Joan Donovan, research director at the Shorenstein Center, notes that 4chan was instrumental in creating the red-pill online cultural movement .\n\nFrom 4chan, this misinformation that the shooter was a trans woman was picked up by many right-wing Facebook groups and probably made it to discussions on private messaging applications. This is the phase at which things are most difficult to track, because many of the groups have small footprints and a select membership or are private by design (as in the case of group messaging services like WhatsApp). We can't see the private messaging, but we can see the uptake from groups like \"Young Conservatives of Southern Indiana\" on Facebook, which posted one of the images taken from the trans woman's Reddit profile along with the claim that she was the shooter. That group has about 4,000 followers, which is not a large audience in social media spaces, but it significantly increases the reach out to a broader audience who is on Facebook but not on 4chan or Reddit.\n\nUnlike 4chan, Facebook actually does have a robust moderating team, but that moderation relies in large part on user reporting, and so someone would have to see the Young Conservatives post, check to verify it, and then report it as false. If the readers at Young Conservatives are generally disposed to buy this misinformation, then that's less likely to happen until the post spills out beyond their usual audience. In this case, that happened, and Facebook did take the post down. Page administrators claimed that the post was actually later judged not to violate community standards by Facebook in a follow-up post, but it no longer seems to be up on their page. But by the time Facebook moderators acted, the claim had gained some visibility-and just because it was removed on one group doesn't necessarily mean it was deleted everywhere.\n\nAs the post on 4chan started to spread through Facebook groups and private group chats, it got picked up by actual influencers: people with large numbers of followers on the major platforms. This is when the misinformation gets the attention of the general public. The claim that the shooter was a trans woman was picked up by Rep. Paul Gosar, a Republican from Arizona; Candace Owens; and Alex Jones. Jones has been banned from Twitter, but still has a large following on his radio show. Gosar's personal account, where he tweeted (and later deleted) the claims has more than 159,000 followers. Candace Owens has more than 3 million.\n\nOnce the claim is blasted out to audiences of that size, it will get the attention of major media outlets. The claim was quickly fact-checked. Gosar took the tweet down, after a few hours and about 100 retweets, when he was confronted with those fact-checks. (Notably, Owens did not. As I first draft this, more than a day later, her posts are still up.) But this leaves us with one more problem: A fact check works only if people see and believe it. If someone sees Gosar's original tweet before it's deleted, but they don't see the fact-check (because they do not follow or trust other media outlets), then they're going to continue to believe the claim made by Gosar. This particular bit of misinformation will continue to circulate in these circles long after the facts are checked and the tweets are deleted.\n\nThis case provides a clear look at a gritty and complicated landscape. In the hours after a disaster, people are grasping in the dark for any information they can find. If the only information they can find is from an anonymous post on 4chan, especially one that aligns with their worldview, then that will be their starting point. This is not the first time such a case has resulted in picking out an innocent person as an attacker. In the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing, pseudo-sleuths identified Sunil Tripathi, who had disappeared in the weeks prior to the attack, as a suspect; the hunch was based on some Redditors' impressions that there was a resemblance between Tripathi and the FBI picture of the suspect. The story was then picked up by Buzzfeed and the BBC, as well as social media personalities. A week after the bombing, Tripathi's body was found; he had died by suicide, apparently well before the marathon.\n\nThere are lots of forms of misinformation. The story of the trans woman misidentified as the shooter is not necessarily the kind that radicalizes future killers or influences elections, though it can be under the wrong circumstances. But it's one of the important and persistent types of cases that comes up. It's also a case that helps us trace a clear path from an anonymous comment on a message board to the Twitter account of a member of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nIt starts with an interface that promotes recency and has limited moderation, like 4chan or certain subreddits. It gets taken up into groups that have small user bases across other platforms, including social media platforms like Facebook and group chats. Because these groups are smaller, they don't attract the attention of moderators as quickly and the information has time to spread, eventually catching the eyes of actual influencers, people with tens of thousands (even millions) of followers. And once it's out, the fact-checking and moderation kicks in, but even that is a limited stopgap. For years to come, some people will believe the shooter was a trans woman. And even if they find that it was debunked, they may consider it a conspiracy to suppress the truth.\n\nFuture Tense is a partnership of Slate , New America , and Arizona State University that examines emerging technologies, public policy, and society.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Adam Schiff Is Crying All the Way to the Bank\n\nLast week, the House Republican majority finally made good on its pledge to censure California congressman Adam Schiff. It was an act of retaliation for Schiff's role in investigating Donald Trump's 2016 campaign ties to Russia and for Schiff's past statements about the \"evidence of collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia,\" as the resolution put it. The censure vote squeaked by, with 213 Republicans voting in support, and six voting present.\n\nThe entire episode was actually a consolation prize for another consolation prize. What far-right House Republicans really wanted was an impeachment vote of Joe Biden; when they couldn't get that, they set their sights on a censure vote of Schiff, which included a call for an ethics investigation into the congressman and a possible $16 million fine, if he were found to have lied.\n\nIt took two attempts, but the final text, stripped of the $16 million fine, narrowly succeeded, making Schiff just the 25 th House member ever censured, and just the second since 2010. (In 2021 Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar was censured after he posted an animated video depicting himself killing his Democratic colleague Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.) After the vote, House Democrats shouted \"shame\" and \"disgrace\" at the GOP majority.\n\nTellingly, House Dems also patted Schiff on the back and cheered him. And Schiff doesn't seem to be taking it too hard. If anything, the censure vote-especially in its diminished form, which took weeks to accomplish, leading to near round-the-clock coverage on MSNBC-was effectively tailor-made to benefit Schiff's Senate aspirations in California. He joined the race for the Senate seat that will be vacated by Dianne Feinstein in January. Now he's campaigning off the censure like it's going out of style. As Insider reported, Schiff sent nearly 20 fundraising emails referencing the censure vote in the weeks leading up to it, and he hasn't stopped since.\n\nA vote to censure, though uncommon, is basically meaningless. It's a public rebuke, but one that comes without any actual consequence. And it's likely that the subsequent ethics investigation, which the censure vote calls for, will never get off the ground.\n\n\"To my Republican colleagues, [who] introduced this resolution, I thank you. You honor me with your enmity,\" Schiff said last week . Sounds about right.\n\nIn many ways, the censure vote was a cherry on top of what has been a dream scenario for Schiff in advancing his Senate campaign. With Democrats in the minority in the House, there was little for them to do. Earlier this year, Republicans removed Schiff from the Intelligence Committee, also mostly a gesture that has allowed Schiff to make himself the lasting face of the anti-Trump resistance-while having to do little in the way of actual legislating to prove it.\n\nCould House Republicans even be doing this on purpose? Their caucus is fractious, chaotic, and disordered. They can't agree on almost anything, or get much of anything done. For those reasons, it may be difficult to imagine that they're also diabolical enough to be elevating a candidate in a hotly contested Democratic primary race.\n\nBut there may be some method to the madness: Speaker Kevin McCarthy is from California; he's the most powerful Republican in the state. The censure measure advanced only with his endorsement, and McCarthy knows full well what's happening in his home state's Senate contest. Republicans have an absolute zero chance of competing for the seat outright, but they could possibly push the field to the right.\n\nIt's not uncommon for the parties to play in each other's primaries, after all. Spending to elevate unelectable, far-right candidates in Republican primaries proved to be one of Democrats' most successful, if controversial, strategies in the 2022 congressional cycle.\n\nAnd Schiff, a former member of the center-right Blue Dog caucus, is the most conservative member of the group of contenders for the sought-after seat. Despite some recent gestures at a rebrand, his track record in 11 terms in Congress is out of step with California's devoutly progressive politics.\n\nSome state Democratic party figures also would much prefer to see a woman and/or a person of color win the role. California made history in the 1990s when it became the first state with two female senators, Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein; it has been a point of pride for California Democrats ever since. Now the possibility of having Adam Schiff become a male senator alongside Alex Padilla, another male senator, has some feeling uneasy, and not just because Schiff is no friend of the left.\n\nDespite it all, Schiff is cruising right along. Recent polling has him uniformly at or near the top of the pile of candidates, and his fundraising haul is astounding. His cash advantage over Rep. Katie Porter, who actually had to spend in her very competitive reelection race in 2022, and Rep. Barbara Lee, who does not share in the fundraising prowess of her competitors, is fearsome. Schiff's Burbank-area House district is not competitive for Republicans, which has allowed him to save his stockpile for a Senate primary that will shatter records in cost.\n\nRepublicans have been coy about the edge they're giving Schiff with these votes. California Republicans in particular refused to cop to it when asked by Insider's Bryan Metzger: \"You can't help what people do with fundraising and all of that,\" said Rep. Doug LaMalfa. \"That's for someone else to worry about,\" said Rep. Kevin Kiley.\n\nBut it's likely not lost on McCarthy.\n\nSchiff and McCarthy are unlikely to be allies or pals anytime soon, and McCarthy is not known as a master operator. But there's no question that the seemingly pointless and toothless stunts he's overseeing could help move the Democratic-controlled state to the right, even if it's just a nudge. For the state party, which has been frustrated for years by the conservative representation of Feinstein, who herself is well to the right of her constituents, that would be more than a minor annoyance. That, plus the favor McCarthy could curry with the Trump-supporting base, is more than motivation enough.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe House just took an important stand against violence in politics.\n\nby Li Zhou\n\nThe House on Wednesday voted 223-207 to censure Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ), more than a week after he posted an animated video edited to depict him killing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and brandishing weapons at President Joe Biden.\n\nFollowing the censure, Gosar will be forced to stand in the middle of the House chamber as a statement condemning his actions is read to him in front of all the members. Additionally, he'll lose his committee assignments, including seats on the Oversight Committee and the Natural Resources Committee, a penalty Democrats also included in this resolution.\n\nGosar's censure - the second most severe punishment a House member can receive, after expulsion - is significant for several reasons. In addition to doling out a public rebuke, it sends an important message against violent rhetoric, which in politics is often disproportionately targeted toward women of color. The loss of committee seats in particular is notable: It's through them that lawmakers are able to weigh in on policy and conduct government oversight - and without them, they have little power.\n\n\"We cannot have members joking about murdering each other, as well as threatening the president of the United States,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said earlier this week.\n\nWhile Democrats have broadly condemned Gosar's actions, Republican leadership has shied away from issuing any outright criticism. \"I called him when I heard about the video, and he made a statement that he doesn't support violence, and he took the video down,\" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said in a CNN interview .\n\nGosar has removed the video following significant backlash, and issued a statement saying he does not \"espouse violence or harm towards any Member of Congress or Mr. Biden,\" but he hasn't apologized.\n\nDemocrats hope the censure vote on Wednesday serves as an explicit condemnation of Gosar's post, and draws a line regarding the type of behavior lawmakers are willing to accept. Violent language by members has become an especially sensitive issue after the January 6 insurrection highlighted how speeches encouraging violence could translate to real-world deaths.\n\n\"When Republicans don't condemn death threats against their colleagues ... it sends a message to the public that these threats are condoned,\" said Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA) in a Wednesday floor speech. This resolution \"reinforces that this behavior will not be tolerated.\"\n\nThe censure vote sets an important precedent for how Congress responds to the sorts of statements about violence some Republican lawmakers have become increasingly comfortable making.\n\nIt's quite rare for the House to actually censure a member: The lower chamber has only done it 23 times before, the last time being in 2010 when then-Rep. Charlie Rangel was censured for ethics violations related to financial misconduct. More recently, the House has voted to strip Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) of her committee assignments after she supported comments calling for violence toward Democrats.\n\nCensure, reprimand, and expulsion are different ways the House can penalize members. Censure and reprimand only require a simple majority in the House, which Democrats possess, while expulsion requires a two-thirds majority.\n\nIf a member is censured or reprimanded, they're able to retain their seat. Unlike a censure, reprimand does not include what's effectively a public admonishing.\n\nIn the past, lawmakers have sometimes been subject to reviews by an ethics committee before a censure vote - something that Democrats have bypassed in Gosar's case because of how clear-cut his actions have been, according to Rep. Ted Deutch (D-FL).\n\n\"There are no open factual questions here for the Ethics Committee to resolve, nor any unresolved questions of intent,\" Deutch, the chair of the Ethics Committee, said in floor remarks. \"It's clear from the video, and from Representative Gosar's public comments minimizing it, that censure is appropriate.\"\n\nDemocrats emphasize that this censure vote is necessary to underscore their condemnation of violence in politics, especially after the insurrection at the Capitol on January 6. Additionally, they note that it's vital to highlight that violence toward women, including lawmakers of color who are often the targets of extreme abuse, is unacceptable.\n\n\"As the events of January 6th have shown, such vicious and vulgar messaging can and does foment actual violence,\" a group of Democratic lawmakers who introduced the censure resolution said in a statement. \"Violence against women in politics is a global phenomenon meant to silence women and discourage them from seeking positions of authority and participating in public life, with women of color disproportionately impacted. Minority Leader McCarthy's silence is tacit approval and just as dangerous.\"\n\nThe censure resolution - specifically provisions that will remove Gosar from his committee assignments - will have concrete effects, including limiting his impact on hearings and policy those panels work on.\n\nIn the past, lawmakers who've lost these assignments have been left scrambling to figure out other ways they can influence legislation and advance positions they hold. Now-former Rep. Chris Collins, who lost his committee assignments in 2018, told Politico that he would focus his energies on more constituent engagement and participation in different caucuses.\n\n\"They basically have nothing to do,\" Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) told the publication when he was asked about lawmakers who were booted from committees. \"If you're cast out of the organized bodies and committees of Congress, and you're kind of just a hitchhiker on the floor, there's very little influence you can have in the House of Representatives.\"\n\nMultiple Democrats have also argued that Gosar's actions are grounds for expulsion given the depictions of violence the video contains. \"When someone sends out a tweet or any other illustration of him or her murdering somebody on the House floor ... that person should not even be a member of this body,\" Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-SC) told CNN .\n\nReaching the two-thirds vote threshold for expulsion, however, would likely be tough given Democrats' narrow majority. Advancing a vote like that would take around 290 votes in the House, meaning dozens of Republicans would have to join the 221-member Democratic caucus to pass it. That would probably be a long shot since Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger are the only two Republicans who backed the censure resolution. (Previously, 11 Republicans voted to strip Greene of her committee assignments.)\n\nMany Republicans' unwillingness to condemn one of their own members suggests that censure is likely the most severe consequence Gosar will face for now.\n\n\"Threatening the life of a colleague is grounds for expulsion,\" Ocasio-Cortez told reporters on Tuesday. \"But given the Republican Party - especially the leader - is too cowardly to really enforce any standard of conduct ... censure and committee removal is the next most appropriate step.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nGiven their older average age, members of Congress could be more at risk for severe symptoms.\n\nby Ella Nilsen and Li Zhou\n\nCoronavirus anxiety is mounting on Capitol Hill.\n\nMembers of both chambers began returning to the Capitol for this week's session on Monday, even as concerns about new coronavirus cases continued to grow. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Reps. Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Matt Gaetz (R-FL), and Doug Collins (R-GA) have all announced plans to \"self-quarantine,\" or stay home in the coming days, after being exposed to an individual who tested positive for coronavirus at the Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nRep. Julia Brownley (D-CA) also announced Thursday she had met with a separate individual last week who has since tested positive for coronavirus. Brownley said she would be working remotely this week, along with her staff.\n\nThe unique role of the Capitol as a hub for visitors and a workplace for lawmakers (many of whom are older) has further compounded concerns. Capitol Hill is an extremely busy place; in addition to being an office for lawmakers flying in from all over the country, it's also a destination for many tourists. The Architect of the Capitol estimates 3 million to 5 million people visit the Capitol each year.\n\nGiven their older average age, members of the Senate and House are also among the groups that could be most at risk for severe coronavirus symptoms. \"Sixty-six senators are over 60 - two-thirds of the body - with more than a quarter over 70,\" NBC News reports . \"The average age of House members is 57.6 years, according to the Congressional Research Service.\"\n\nAt this point, the Hill feels a bit like it's in a \"holding pattern,\" one Democratic aide told Vox. While staffers have been receiving intermittent alerts about the latest coronavirus developments, individual offices have also been prepping to ensure that teams can more easily telecommute and work remotely. No decisions have been announced yet about any type of extended leave or recess, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters Monday there's no reason yet to close the Capitol temporarily.\n\n\"Obviously members are concerned about what's happening with coronavirus and its impact,\" another Democratic aide told Vox.\n\nTeleworking is one thing, but the fact remains that lawmakers need to be present to vote. The House and Senate have already approved $8.3 billion in coronavirus aid , but committee chairs are meeting with Pelosi Monday night to discuss additional measures Congress may need to take for Americans impacted by the virus, as well as the US economy.\n\n\"We can't vote from home, however,\" Pelosi told reporters last Thursday. \"So it's about security; it's not about testing everybody who comes into the building. That's not realistic.\"\n\nCongress is far from the only place where concerns about coronavirus are growing - and what lawmakers do in response is likely to send a strong message to the broader public.\n\nIf lawmakers were to head on recess, it could set an alarming precedent, according to one former Senate aide.\n\n\"I think it would send a terrible signal to the American people if Congress decided to go on recess for a few weeks while the virus works its way through the country,\" said Jim Manley, who was a staffer for former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Manley also worked on the Hill during the anthrax scare lawmakers faced in 2001, and he noted that the ongoing operations in Congress helped demonstrate the government's ability to continue functioning during a crisis.\n\nIt's worth noting the anthrax scare had key differences with coronavirus, which is highly contagious and is affecting the country on a broader scale. Additionally, technological advances have changed significantly since 2001, making potential remote work more accessible.\n\nClosing down the Capitol, or severely curbing its operations, is also not the only course of action in the near term. To reduce potential exposure to coronavirus, lawmakers could cut back on the number of meetings they conduct, the travel they do, and the events they take part in. Some offices are already beginning to take such measures.\n\nThere's not a ton of recent precedent for Congress to physically shutter, though there's been at least one case when the Capitol closed, in part. \"I think it was actually 1918 that the Capitol was actually closed for health reasons,\" Senate Rules Committee Chair Roy Blunt told CNN in an allusion to the Spanish flu pandemic that took place at the time . Back then, the House and Senate closed their public galleries and held intermittent pro forma sessions.\n\nThe question on the minds of multiple members of Congress and their staff is if and when they'll get the green light from leadership to work remotely, especially if the coronavirus threat worsens in the United States.\n\n\"There has been guidance sent out on continuity of operations plans, ensuring offices have the resources they need to telework,\" a Democratic aide told Vox, adding that members of Congress have offered a number of ideas on that front.\n\nMembers who have reported being exposed to individuals with coronavirus are working from home, but it's been on a case-by-case basis. Though Pelosi has said House members and other offices are updating their technology to be able to work remotely, there has been no decision made thus far on whether lawmakers will actually work remotely or if Congress will simply hold a recess to allow members and staff to stay home.\n\n\"In case, god forbid, but in case there is a need for people to work from home, all of the offices - not only congressional offices but offices that serve the purpose of the Capitol - will have the technology up to date in order to do that,\" Pelosi said Thursday.\n\nWorking remotely is one thing, but voting remotely is another thing entirely. Voting is a huge part of the job of a member of Congress, especially during a massive public health crisis if more new funding or economic stimulus needs to be approved.\n\nPelosi said last week that members can't vote from home, and House rules state :\n\nEvery Member shall be present within the Hall of the House during its sittings, unless excused or necessarily prevented, and shall vote on each question put, unless having a direct personal or pecuniary interest in the event of such question.\n\nDespite a push for the ability to vote remotely in the past, those who have argued against it have long said that such tactics don't allow f or ample debate and discussion to take place . Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) previously proposed a bill that would enable lawmakers to take certain procedural votes remotely and videoconference during hearings, though it hasn't gained enough traction to advance.\n\nThe emerging challenges posed by the coronavirus, however, could prompt lawmakers to give it - and measures like it - another look.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Paul Gosar is facing attacks from an atypical group in his reelection bid: his own family.\n\nSix of Gosar's nine brothers and sisters have endorsed his Democratic opponent, Dr. David Brill, and appeared in Brill's campaign videos discussing their brother. One video shows his siblings saying that the Arizona Republican isn't working for the people; another, titled \" A family defends its honor ,\" features them discussing the decision to speak out against Gosar and urging voters to vote against him in November. Another focuses on health care.\n\nThis isn't the only example of family members speaking out against candidates in the 2018 midterms - Randy Bryce , the Democratic candidate to replace House Speaker Paul Ryan in Wisconsin, has been hit with a Republican attack ad featuring his brother, James Bryce. But the sheer number of siblings speaking out against Gosar is unique.\n\n\"None of this is pleasant for any of us,\" David Gosar, a lawyer, says in the \"A family defends its honor\" video.\n\n\"This isn't just about Paul; this is about family,\" Jennifer Gosar, a medical interpreter, says in the same video.\n\n\"It's intervention time,\" says Tim Gosar, a private investigator. \"And intervention time means that you go vote, and you go to vote Paul out.\"\n\nThe videos have brought to the surface some evidently significant family divisions - and inspired reactions from Rep. Gosar.\n\n\"You can't pick your family,\" he tweeted after the videos were released on Friday, adding, \"To the six angry Democrat Gosars - see you at Mom and Dad's house!\"\n\nIn another tweet, he called his siblings \"liberal Democrats who hate President Trump\" and \"disgruntled\" Hillary Clinton supporters.\n\nGosar, who represents Arizona's Fourth Congressional District, was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2010 as part of the Tea Party wave. His brother David Gosar told the Washington Post that's around the time they stopped speaking, when Paul Gosar told him that he believed the \"birther\" theory that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States.\n\n\"I was like, 'Oh my God, you have to be kidding me,' and then he went and got elected,\" David Gosar told the Post. \"I'm not going to break bread with a racist.\"\n\nDavid told the New York Times that he keeps his Twitter account for the sole purpose of admonishing his brother. It's that Twitter account that caught the Brill campaign's attention.\n\n\"None of us are doing this for publicity,\" David Gosar told the Phoenix New Times . \"None of us even want to do it.\"\n\nThe internet has delighted in the Gosar family feud, but one person not enjoying it is the siblings' 85-year-old mother, Bernadette Gosar, who lives in Wyoming. She apparently learned of the videos when contacted about them by the New York Times and told the publication she was \"shocked\" and \"crushed\" by the situation.\n\nShe said that she has a \"wonderful family\" but clarified that, politically, she's with Paul. \"He's done a hell of a job for Arizona, and they love him,\" she said.\n\nRep. Gosar is an immigration hardliner. In January, he made headlines when he tweeted that he had contacted the US Capitol Police and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to ask that they arrest undocumented immigrants attending the president's State of the Union address. Some Democratic lawmakers had invited two dozen young unauthorized immigrants, often referred to as DREAMers, to the speech.\n\nAs the Times notes, seven of Gosar's brothers and sisters previously wrote a letter to a local Arizona newspaper condemning his suggestion in a Vice News interview that a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last year was organized by an \"Obama sympathizer\" and funded by billionaire George Soros.\n\nIt's not clear whether the siblings' public opposition has hurt Gosar's chances at winning in November.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nNo, Capitol Police likely won't arrest DREAMers attending the address.\n\nby Ella Nilsen\n\nThere are 24 young unauthorized immigrants known as DREAMers who will attend President Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday night at the invitation of senators and representatives.\n\nBut at least one lawmaker, Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ), sees them as a threat. On Tuesday afternoon, Gosar tweeted that he had contacted US Capitol Police and US Attorney General Jeff Sessions to ask that they arrest any undocumented immigrants attending Trump's speech.\n\nGosar, a conservative Congress member from Arizona, is fervently opposed to immigration reforms giving DREAMers a pathway to citizenship.\n\n\"Of all the places where the Rule of Law needs to be enforced, it should be in the hallowed halls of Congress,\" he said in a separate tweet Tuesday afternoon. \"Any illegal aliens attempting to go through security, under any pretext of invitation or otherwise, should be arrested and deported.\"\n\nLet's be clear: It's highly unlikely that Capitol Police will comply with Gosar's request, as all the young immigrants attending tonight are recipients of either the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or Temporary Protected Status programs. As such, they are legally shielded from deportation.\n\nPart of getting DACA and TPS is getting a work permit to work in the US legally. Those permits come with a Social Security number, and all states allow DACA recipients to apply for drivers' licenses. Therefore, the 24 DREAMers who are in attendance at Trump's State of the Union speech likely do not have to worry about getting arrested.\n\nBut it's notable that a conservative Congress member is lumping DACA recipients in with \"illegal\" immigrants - this kind of rhetoric reveals how many conservative immigration hawks view the DACA debate.\n\nDemocrats and moderate Republicans have come to view DREAMers, many of whom grew up in America and think of themselves as American, as a sympathetic population that should be given a pathway to permanent legal status or citizenship. But hardline conservatives view this population as just one more group of unauthorized immigrants that should be deported.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nSen. Ted Cruz and Rep. Paul Gosar have self-quarantined after being exposed to the virus at the conference.\n\nby Sean Collins\n\nSen. Ted Cruz , Rep. Paul Gosar , and Rep. Doug Collins announced Monday plans to self-quarantine after interacting with an individual infected with the novel coronavirus at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in late February.\n\nNone of the three Republican lawmakers has exhibited any symptoms associated with Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, but in Monday statements, each said that they have decided to isolate themselves out of \"an abundance of caution.\"\n\nThat Cruz, Gosar, and Collins had concerning contact at CPAC is striking considering many of the conference's speakers worked to, as President Donald Trump has done, minimize the seriousness of the virus.\n\nFor example, US diplomat Mick Mulvaney - who at the time was the acting White House chief of staff - told attendees, \"The reason you're seeing so much attention to [the coronavirus] today is that [Democrats] think this is going to be what brings down the president. That's what this is all about.\"\n\nAnd a number of attendees felt the same, like the woman who told Fox News's Lawrence Jones coronavirus concerns were Democrats' \"next game.\"\n\n\"You know, we go from one thing to the next,\" she said. \"This is after impeachment failed. Russia failed. So now this is what we're doing.\"\n\nNow, however, there has been a shift in rhetoric. Saturday, the American Conservative Union (the group that puts on the conference) announced it had become aware of the Covid-19 case. It wrote in a statement , \"During this time, we need to remain calm, listen to our health care professionals, and support each other.\"\n\nWhile Cruz, Gosar, and Collins say they have not seen signs of any symptoms, it is not clear whether the infected individual transmitted the virus to other attendees.\n\nThe infected attendee has not been named, but it appears the man had access to many of the conference's highest-profile guests. Matt Schlapp, head of the American Conservative Union, has said he shook hands with him.\n\nSchlapp, as the event's face, shook hands with hundreds of other people, including Trump. And Cruz, Gosar, and Collins were all in contact with the infected individual as well - Gosar said in his statement he shook hands with the man \"several times,\" while Collins said he was in a photo with him.\n\nAll this has many CPAC attendees \"apoplectic,\" Raheem Kassam, editor-in-chief of the conservative outlet the National Pulse, wrote on Twitter Sunday. Kassam claims to be feeling ill after interacting with attendees who had contact with the infected man, including Gosar. And concerningly, Kassam said a number of the president's closest advisers, allies, and one cabinet member were also in contact with the infected individual.\n\nAmid all of this, Trump has continued to downplay the seriousness of the coronavirus, and unlike the three GOP lawmakers who all - before they became aware of their exposure - advocated for hand-washing and other protective measures, has been dismissive of the idea he might need to alter his habits.\n\nFor instance, when asked Friday at the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) if he was doing anything to protect himself from the coronavirus, Trump responded, \"Not at all.\"\n\nAnd at a time when public health officials are asking people to cut down on shaking hands, Trump told reporters at the CDC he has no plans to stop doing so.\n\n\"If you're a politician, like I walk in, and the doctors have their hands out, 'Hello sir, how are you.' If you don't shake hands, they're not going to like you too much,\" he said, adding, \"The fact is, I feel very secure.\"\n\nThe disease is still rare in the US, but Trump is not secure from it. He, as he admitted at the CDC, shakes dozens of hands per day. He has been in contact with those exposed to the virus at CPAC, like Schlapp and Collins, but also those exposed elsewhere. For instance, both Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attended March's AIPAC (American Israel Public Affairs Committee) conference, at which two attendees have been confirmed to have Covid-19. And there are concerns Pence may have been exposed to the virus during a visit to Florida.\n\nAnd Trump - as well as many members of his inner circle - is part of the demographic public health officials have said need to exercise the most caution about the virus.\n\n\"If you are an elderly person with an underlying condition, if you get infected the risk of getting into trouble is considerable,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Meet the Press Sunday.\n\nWe don't know much about the president's health other than what he and his administration tell us (namely that he is healthy, and in his words , that he has a \"gorgeous chest\" containing a healthy heart), but we do know his age: He is 73 years old.\n\nFauci said Sunday the older population and those with existing health conditions should \"say no [to] large crowds, no [to] long trips. And above all, don't get on a cruise ship.\"\n\nTrump, however, is saying yes to large crowds.\n\n\"I'm not concerned at all,\" Trump said Saturday in response to reports of the CPAC Covid-19 case and added, despite coronavirus concerns, \"We'll hold tremendous rallies.\"\n\nBut White House staff is becoming increasingly concerned, the Washington Post's Toluse Olorunnipa, Josh Dawsey, and Juliet Eilperin reported Monday. They note staffers are considering reducing Trump's travel to comply with the CDC recommendation that senior citizens limit their time on airplanes, and while Trump has held rallies ahead of Democratic primaries in recent weeks, he does not have a rally scheduled for Monday evening - or any rallies on his calendar in the immediate future.\n\nAnd even officials who vouched for Trump's vigor have begun to temper their comments.\n\nFor instance, Surgeon General Jerome Adams said Sunday, Trump \"sleeps less than I do and he's healthier than what I am.\"\n\nThe president was apparently so pleased with the statement he retweeted the above clip tweeted by my colleague Aaron Rupar.\n\nBut Monday, Adams - who is decades younger than the president - said the statement was \"wrong,\" tweeting \"I made a poor attempt at self deprecating humor based on my own well documented chronic medical issues - I in fact take five times as many meds as the president currently reportedly does. I should not have made this comparison.\"\n\nBut the president's retweet and his other statements about the virus are good reminders that - whether he is personally in danger of infection or not - his flippant attitude toward the virus is putting others in danger.\n\nHis claims that criticism of his coronavirus response are part of a Democratic \"hoax\" against him inspires many - like the CPAC attendee Jones interviewed - to believe the same. And in believing that, she placed herself in a crowded public place at a time when experts are advising people to do the opposite. Having done so, she inadvertently exposed herself to the coronavirus, and - had she become infected with it - would have exposed all she came into contact with.\n\nBut beyond issues of the president's words affecting person-to-person spread, his tendency to pat himself on the back has made it appear that all that needs to be done to limit the virus has been done.\n\nHe has often promoted the fact that he limited travel; he wrote on Twitter Sunday, for instance, \"We moved VERY early to close borders to certain areas, which was a Godsend.\"\n\nBut experts say the president's travel ban was misplaced and that by focusing on that, preparations to ensure the availability of testing and to slow the spread of community transmission seem to have fallen through the cracks.\n\n\"Travel bans and overseas quarantines and travel screening and so on are not going to offer us much protection anymore,\" former director of the USAID's Office of US Foreign Disaster Assistance Jeremy Konyndyk told Vox's Alex Ward . \"The main driver of transmission now is going to be community transmission, which is likely already ongoing in numerous places around the country. That needs to be the central focus of the policy now.\"\n\nFor some administration officials - like Fauci - that does indeed seem to be the focus. Fauci told Meet the Press 's Chuck Todd public health officials will make understanding and limiting community spread as well as developing mitigation strategies their priorities in the next three months.\n\nBut for Trump, the focus has been very different.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe reasons the GOP is so eager for political revenge.\n\nby Li Zhou\n\nAfter failing to wrangle the votes last week, House Republicans mustered the majority needed to censure Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) on Wednesday . That move is among the latest Republican attacks against prominent Democrats - including members of the Biden administration and Congress - and it's one that's aimed at energizing the GOP base ahead of the 2024 election .\n\nRepublicans targeted Schiff specifically because of his leading role in former President Donald Trump's first impeachment proceeding as well as his role in investigating possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia . As part of the House Intelligence Committee inquiry into the subject, Schiff alleged there was strong evidence of potential collusion , though Republicans argue that special counsel Robert Mueller's report later disputed this conclusion .\n\n\"Mr. Schiff exploited his position as chair of Intel Committee, and every opportunity possible, threatening national security , undermining our duly elected president and bringing dishonor upon the institution,\" Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL), the sponsor of the censure resolution, said prior to the vote.\n\nThough the censure was framed as being about holding Schiff accountable, it's ultimately part of a broader Republican political strategy. Many conservative voters and lawmakers want retribution after House Democrats launched two impeachment efforts against Trump, censured Rep. Paul Gosar and removed Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from her committees. Censuring Schiff allowed House Republican leadership to give that faction of the caucus a win, while also showing the party's most devoted voters that the GOP is using its power to scrutinize Democrats and Biden.\n\nAfter a vote on Schiff's prior censure failed, Trump - who has a large lead in primary polls , and is still seen as a kingmaker, despite his mixed 2022 record - argued that any House member that voted against it should face a primary challenge.\n\n\"Republicans are responding rationally to electoral incentives,\" Cook Political House expert Dave Wasserman told Vox. \"Most of them represent overwhelmingly red districts where their party's base are demanding that they take maximum action against the Biden administration. ... This is the reddest red meat that House Republicans could be throwing to the base.\"\n\nRepublicans' censure resolution was approved 213-209, with six GOP members, including five who are also on the Ethics Committee, voting present. The measure was an updated version of the one that failed last week: The earlier version included the possibility of a $16 million fine if Schiff was found guilty of misconduct, and that provision has since been dropped due to some members' concerns about it.\n\nAfter the vote passed, Schiff was asked to stand in the center of the House where he was verbally reprimanded by Speaker Kevin McCarthy. As the proceeding was taking place, Democrats yelled \"Shame!\" and \"Disgrace!\" at their GOP colleagues. Schiff was quick to denounce the censure, calling it \"petty political payback.\" And some Democrats accused Republicans of hypocrisy , noting they opted to censure Schiff even as they've stopped short of similarly disciplining members like Rep. George Santos (R-NY), who has been indicted for fraud and money laundering.\n\nSchiff's censure could be the first of a series of actions that Republicans take this week to hit back at Democrats. Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert has introduced an impeachment resolution targeting President Joe Biden, which is set to be tabled on the House floor, while Rep. Greene is on track to introduce a similar impeachment resolution taking aim at FBI Director Christopher Wray. In a closed-door meeting, though, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy warned that this might not be the right time to pursue a Biden impeachment, arguing that Republicans have to build the case first.\n\n\"It's simply a matter of trying to placate the Trumpist base through the politics of retribution,\" says American University government professor David Barker. \"Now that they have the majority, they are wielding that power to try to 'give the Dems a taste of their own medicine.'\"\n\nThe Democrat-led impeachments and punishments weren't the same as those currently moving through the House, however. Gosar and Greene were penalized for supporting threats of violence against their fellow lawmakers, while Trump was first impeached for abuse of power and obstructing Congress, then for his role in the January 6 insurrection .\n\nRepublicans also have to navigate the balance of catering to their base and not turning off moderate voters, who are opposed to these acts of political revenge. That's part of the reason House leadership has been more circumspect about pursuing an impeachment of Biden. If House Republicans overreach, after all, they'd risk losing their narrow majority and hurting their electoral chances with swing voters.\n\n\"They have 18 members from districts that Biden carried in 2020. This is fraught with peril for those Republicans,\" says Wasserman.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

      "text": "Where \"replacement theory\" comes from - and why it refuses to go away\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe white supremacist conspiracy theory has a long history in the United States and abroad.\n\nby Fabiola Cineas\n\nBefore the gunman shot down 10 Black people in Buffalo, New York, at a supermarket on Saturday afternoon, he had stated his intent: \"kill as many Black people as possible.\" He reportedly wrote these words in a 180-page screed published online before he carried out what investigators are calling a hate crime and a racist act of violent extremism.\n\nThe 18-year-old white man, who claimed to drive hours to the zip code he targeted in Buffalo because it \"has the highest black percentage that is close enough to where I live,\" repeatedly lamented immigration, which he feared would result in \"ethnic replacement,\" \"cultural replacement,\" \"racial replacement,\" and ultimately, he wrote, \"white genocide.\"\n\nThis is the \"white replacement theory\" or the \"Great Replacement\" that has motivated similar mass killings in recent years - the racist conspiracy theory that holds that, through immigration, interracial marriage, integration, and violence, and at the behest of secret forces orchestrated by \"global elites\" (as the Buffalo shooter claimed) or Jews, white people are being disenfranchised, disempowered, and pushed out of \"white nations.\"\n\nThese ideas are not new. They have been documented for at least a century, the forces of white fear that shaped the national origin quotas of the 1920s . They have inspired mass attacks - and also smaller-scale instances of violence - that have claimed the lives of hundreds of people in the United States and abroad.\n\nIn the United States, white people's fear about being replaced by \"outsiders\" and migrants of \"inferior\" backgrounds has a long history. These fears were especially apparent in the early 1900s when white intellectuals openly explored and shared ideas about displacement that shaped immigration policies and other laws.\n\nA leading proponent was Madison Grant , a lawyer, eugenicist, and conservationist who published The Passing of the Great Race in 1916, arguing that the supposedly superior \"Nordic\" race was in danger of extinction in the United States. Grant advocated for sterilization programs for supposedly inferior races, immigration restrictions, and anti-miscegenation laws that would stop any intermingling between racial groups.\n\nGrant's work had lasting consequences, influencing the lawmakers who drafted the Immigration Act of 1924 , which limited the number of immigrants from southern and western Europe for 40 years. His work left an impression on President Theodore Roosevelt, who praised it as \"a capital book\"; President Calvin Coolidge echoed Grant's ideas in a 1921 Good Housekeeping article, \"Whose Country Is This?\" claiming that the US should reject being regarded as a \"dumping ground\" for an \"advancing horde of aliens.\" Adolf Hitler, meanwhile, referred to Grant's work as his bible .\n\nGrant was not alone in making his argument. Four years later, an adherent of his, historian Lothrop Stoddard, published The Rising Tide of Color: The Threat Against White World-Supremacy , in which he similarly warned that the Nordic race would be eliminated or absorbed by \"alien hordes\" of immigrants that he viewed to be of lesser value including \"Alpines, Mediterraneans, Levantines and Jews.\" He called for race solidarity among white people to preserve what he considered \"good stocks.\" Stoddard, too, influenced elected officials like Warren G. Harding, who praised the book in a public speech in 1921, and leaders abroad in Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Nazi Germany .\n\nBy the end of World War II, the ideas that Grant and Stoddard promulgated were largely disavowed by elites for their association with the Nazis and the Holocaust. But they didn't disappear . US senator and former governor of Mississippi Theodore G. Bilbo published the book Take Your Choice: Separation or Mongrelization in 1947, in which he argued that the \"Caucasian race,\" which he credited with creating civilization, was \"in jeopardy\" from Black people, whom he considered \"mongrels\" who could not \"maintain a culture.\"\n\nThe 1970s saw the use of the phrase \"white genocide\" in the official newspaper of the National Socialist White People's Party (formerly the American Nazi Party), which argued \"birth control campaigns\" would make whites \"outnumbered four to one.\" Jean Raspail's 1973 dystopian fantasy novel Camp of the Saints , depicted a world in which France and the Western world is invaded by foreign dark-skinned refugees - a text \"widely revered\" by white supremacists, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center .\n\nThe controversial 1994 book The Bell Curve argued that the United States was encouraging the \"wrong women\" to have babies, and that \"the intelligence of immigrants is a legitimate topic for policymakers to think about\" since \"Latin and black immigrants are, at least in the short run, putting some downward pressure on the distribution of intelligence.\"\n\nFrench philosopher and white nationalist Renaud Camus helped give the theory new life in a 2012 book, Le Grand Remplacement . In a 2017 interview with Vox following the Charlottesville \"Unite the Right\" rally, Camus argued that the extremists who chanted \"we will not be replaced\" had reason to be concerned that the United States could change into \"just another poor, derelict, hyperviolent, and stupefied quarter of the 'global village.'\"\n\nAt the core of replacement theory is the concept of protecting a white \"race\" - one that is not necessarily bound by borders but simply held together by racist ideas of white power and supposed white dominance.\n\nThe Turner Diaries , a 1978 novel about a race war that eliminates all nonwhites, directly inspired the Oklahoma City bomber, who killed 168 people. The same text inspired the Norwegian far-right extremist who killed 77 people , mostly immigrants, in a bombing and gun rampage in 2011, saying he was fighting \"mass immigration.\"\n\nThe Norway extremist inspired the New Zealand shooter, who killed at least 50 Muslim worshippers at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019, leaving behind a document that explained an alleged \"assault on European people.\"\n\nAnd the New Zealand shooter particularly inspired the Buffalo shooter, according to his 180-page screed.\n\nReplacement theory forms the strands that connect this web of violence - from the Oklahoma bomber to Norway to New Zealand to Buffalo. As University of Chicago historian Kathleen Belew told Vox following the Christchurch massacre in 2019, white supremacists motivated by replacement theory and white power see themselves as fighting for \"the Aryan nation.\"\n\nThe connections don't stop there. The shooter who killed 23 people in El Paso, Texas, in 2019 claimed he acted in response to \"the Hispanic invasion\" of the state.\n\nIn 2018, a man who blamed Jewish people for helping to resettle immigrants killed 11 Jewish people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe white man who killed nine Black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015 claimed to be concerned about \"living in the melting pot\"; the white man who stabbed two people to death on a train in Oregon in May 2017, after harassing two Muslim women, adhered to the idea that there should be a \"white homeland for whites only.\" The man who opened fire in a California synagogue, killing one and injuring three others in 2019, wrote in an open letter that Jews were preparing a \"meticulously planned genocide of the European race\" and cited the Christchurch and Pittsburgh shootings as inspiration.\n\nThe white people who gathered in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 for the Unite the Right rally, where a white supremacist struck and killed a woman with his car, chanted \" you will not replace us \" and \" Jews will not replace us .\"\n\nMeanwhile, the rhetoric of replacement theory has become increasingly prominent among some Republicans. Party members have espoused tenets of replacement theory, and some have supported it by name , to help bolster anti-immigration sentiments and policies.\n\nThroughout his presidency, Donald Trump repeatedly employed the arguments and tropes that form the basis of replacement theory - that white people were facing \"white genocide\" as a result of an \"invasion\" from foreigners. \"We don't want what is happening with immigration in Europe to happen with us!\" Trump tweeted in 2018. The former president's latest presidential campaign posted more than 2,000 ads that featured the word \"invasion,\" according to a New York Times analysis .\n\nFollowing Trump's fearmongering that a migrant caravan of Central Americans was on its way to the US's southern border, other lawmakers adopted the language. Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) has repeatedly tweeted about an invasion that lawmakers need to take action against.\n\nFormer Iowa Rep. Steve King, who was in Congress from 2003 to 2021, constantly voiced fears about replacement. In 2017 he tweeted , \"We can't restore our civilization with someone else's babies,\" once retweeted a Nazi sympathizer's fears about migration, and celebrated Hungary's authoritarian leader Viktor Orbán for denouncing \"mixing cultures.\"\n\nFox News' Tucker Carlson has perhaps become the foremost champion of replacement theory on the right. In about 400 episodes of his show since 2016, according to a New York Times analysis , he shared ideas about replacement. He even used the idea to defend the people who carried out the January 6, 2021 insurrection at the US Capitol. \"In political terms, this policy is called the great replacement, the replacement of legacy Americans with more obedient people from faraway countries,\" Carlson said on his program last year in response to the Haitian migrants who arrived at the border.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) defended Carlson's interpretation of replacement theory on Twitter, saying the news host was \"correct\" in his analysis of \"what is happening to America.\"\n\nThere's some evidence that these ideas are resonating with Americans. A large poll conducted by the Associated Press and NORC in late 2021 found that about one in three US adults thinks that there is a plot underway to replace US-born Americans with immigrants. Republicans were more likely than Democrats to believe that native-born Americans are losing economic, political, and cultural influence because of immigration.\n\nReplacement theory has a long history, but no longer lies dormant - if it ever did - in the past, or in the black holes of the internet. The conspiracy allows white supremacist violence to remain \" the most persistent and lethal threat \" in America, as long as the country fails to root it out .\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nOmar, who has a long history of being targeted by GOP attacks, has been accused in the past of invoking anti-Semitic tropes.\n\nby Li Zhou\n\nOn Thursday, House Republicans voted 218-211 to remove Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), a three-term progressive, from the Foreign Affairs Committee. It's an act that's the latest GOP effort to secure political revenge for Democrats' conduct during the last Congress.\n\nRepublicans have been eager to target certain Democrats and their committee assignments ever since Reps. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) were removed from their committees in bipartisan votes last term, due to threats of political violence both espoused.\n\nPreviously, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy had barred Reps. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Eric Swalwell (D-CA) from sitting on the House Select Committee on Intelligence. McCarthy has criticized Schiff for his handling of President Donald Trump's first impeachment, and claims that Schiff advanced false information as part of it . He's also pointed to connections that Swalwell had to a Chinese intelligence operative, though the lawmaker has not been accused of wrongdoing, per Axios . Swalwell and Schiff, both of whom were outspoken and high-profile critics of Trump, have denounced McCarthy's moves as an act of \"political vengeance.\"\n\nSince those seats were on a select committee, McCarthy was able to block both lawmakers on his own. However, a majority of the House had to vote on a resolution to remove Omar from Foreign Affairs.\n\nAll 211 Democrats present wound up opposing the resolution, while 218 Republicans voted in favor of it, and one Republican - Rep. David Joyce (R-OH) - voted present.\n\nRepublicans' case against Omar sitting on Foreign Affairs centered on past statements she's made that some have characterized as anti-Semitic , including describing US lawmakers' support for Israel as \"all about the Benjamins,\" a comment that Democrats also condemned as trafficking in anti-Semitic tropes. Following outcries, Omar apologized for her remarks. Ahead of Thursday's vote, Omar also cosponsored a resolution that condemned anti-Semitism and recognized \"Israel as America's legitimate and democratic ally.\"\n\nThe focus on Omar's committee assignments also marks the latest instance that the lawmaker, who is a Muslim American woman and Somali refugee, has been targeted and singled out by Republicans, including members of the far right.\n\nPreviously, Rep. Lauren Boebert levied Islamophobic attacks on Omar in late 2021; Boebert faced minimal condemnation from Republican leaders. Omar has also been the subject of racist attacks from Trump and the subject of violent imagery from Greene. This history has led some Muslim American activists to suggest the push to remove Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee was just another play to nativist elements of the GOP base.\n\nDemocrats have also argued that Omar has been unfairly targeted again, and that her actions were wrongly equated with those of Gosar and Greene.\n\n\"You cannot remove a Member of Congress from a committee simply because you do not agree with their views,\" Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal said in a statement. \"This is both ludicrous and dangerous. In the last Congress, Republican members were moved from committees with a bipartisan vote for endangering the safety of their colleagues.\"\n\nMcCarthy has made clear that he was interested in going after Omar ever since last year, when Republicans retook the House majority. At the time, Omar suggested the GOP's efforts to disempower her were personal , and she was even more pointed in a recent interview with CNN .\n\nPointing to the repeated racist and Islamophobic attacks she's faced from Republicans in the past, she said, \"These members don't believe a Muslim refugee, an African, should even be in Congress.\"\n\nThis week's resolution, which was introduced by Rep. Max Miller (R-OH), alleged that past comments Omar made are anti-Semitic and that they should disqualify her from sitting on the Foreign Affairs Committee. She has \"attempted to undermine the relationship between the United States and Israel, one of the most important strategic alliances we have,\" Miller said in a statement .\n\nMcCarthy has said that he's comfortable with Omar serving on other committees, but not Foreign Affairs, which she's been for the last two terms.\n\nNot all Republicans were initially on board with McCarthy's plan. A few Republican lawmakers, including Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC), initially resisted it because they argued that it would set a concerning example both parties could employ in the future. Others, like Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), said they were unsure how to vote because they believe, as a New York Times editorial argued, Omar brings an important viewpoint to foreign policy discussions . In the end, nearly every Republican voted in favor of the resolution.\n\nIn addition to his specific grievances with Omar, McCarthy has emphasized that Democrats set a precedent by voting for the removal of Gosar and Greene from their committees last term. \"What they have started cannot be easily undone. Their actions today, and the past, have forever changed the way the House operates,\" McCarthy said in a floor speech following the vote to remove Gosar from committees . Although turnover on committees happens every term, the removal of specific members of the minority party by the majority party had not happened in modern times when Greene was stripped of assignments in 2021.\n\nDemocrats, however, have said the Greene and Gosar scenarios were different from Omar's. In Greene's case, she was disciplined for sharing posts promoting violence toward other lawmakers including a graphic of her holding a gun alongside images of members of the Squad. Greene was also criticized for racist comments and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories she shared, including by McCarthy himself. Gosar was stripped of committees after posting an animated video that depicted him killing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and brandishing weapons at President Joe Biden.\n\nIn the two votes, Republicans voted along with Democrats for their respective removals; 11 Republicans supported Greene's removal, while Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger - Republicans who have been more willing than most to be critical of their party, and who are no longer in Congress - supported Gosar's.\n\nDemocrats have emphasized that they took action against Greene and Gosar because Republicans refused to discipline extremist members themselves. In 2019, Republican leadership removed Rep. Steve King from committees, for example, after he condoned white supremacy. They've argued repeatedly that Omar's actions are far from comparable.\n\n\"There's no reason to remove Congresswoman Omar from her committees except revenge,\" Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), a Democrat who has criticized some of Omar's past comments, told Politico . \"We removed Congressman [Paul] Gosar and [Marjorie] Taylor Greene because they threatened violence against other members, including death.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe RNC censured two members of Congress for refusing to play along.\n\nby Ellen Ioanes\n\nOn Friday, the Republican National Committee officially stated that the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, which left at least five dead and about 140 injured , was \"legitimate political discourse.\"\n\nIn a two-page censure resolution condemning Republican Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger for their participation in the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack, the RNC wrote that \"Representatives Cheney and Kinzinger are participating in a Democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse, and they are both utilizing their past professed political affiliation to mask Democrat abuse of prosecutorial power for partisan purposes.\"\n\nIn a subsequent tweet, RNC chair Ronna McDaniel expanded on the language of the censure to clarify that it referred to \"ordinary citizens who engaged in legitimate political discourse that had nothing to do with violence at the Capitol.\"\n\nThe original text of the resolution, however - which, the New York Times notes , was \"carefully negotiated in private among party members\" before publication - is a fitting cap to a week that saw the GOP, led by former President Donald Trump, draw closer than ever to explicitly supporting the attack on the Capitol and its goal of overturning the 2020 election.\n\nIn addition to the censure, Trump last Saturday told supporters at a rally in Conroe, Texas, that he would consider pardoning those charged in connection with the January 6 attack, and Politico reported on Wednesday that he also contemplated doing so before leaving office in January last year.\n\n\"If I run and if I win [in 2024], we will treat those people from January 6 fairly. We will treat them fairly,\" Trump said at the rally , without addressing any specific concerns about the treatment of rioters. \"And if it requires pardons, we will give them pardons. Because they are being treated so unfairly.\"\n\nTrump also said in a statement last week that former Vice President Mike Pence \"could have overturned the Election!\" - an assertion that, while incorrect, is among Trump's most overt remarks about the intent behind January 6 and his actions leading up to it.\n\nTrump has not yet announced an official run for the presidency in 2024, but signs point to a likely White House bid as he retains a tight grip on the GOP rank and file.\n\nIn the meantime, large swaths of the Republican Party, still apparently in Trump's thrall, have shifted their position on the Capitol insurrection, distancing themselves from the disturbing reality of those events and positioning the insurrectionists as innocent protesters, or even patriotic guardians of the Constitution.\n\nThat reversal - from horror at the falsehood-fueled spectacle that unfolded at the Capitol last January to condemnation of Republicans who defy Trump's narrative - may have coalesced even more clearly over the past week and a half, but it's been building almost since the attack, spearheaded by members of Congress like Reps. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA).\n\nWhile some establishment Republicans, including Sen. Mitt Romney , have spoken out against the censure and praised Cheney's and Kinzinger's moral compasses, while others have expressed dismay at the idea of a future President Trump pardoning January 6 rioters, many have bought so wholeheartedly into Trump's narrative that they attacked Pence for accurately disputing on Thursday Trump's assertion that he could have overturned the results of the election.\n\nTrump's assertion that he wants fair treatment for the January 6 defendants may be superficially benign, but in reality, it's just one front in the GOP attempt to mythologize the attack as less severe than it was.\n\nTrump, along with members of Congress like Gaetz and Greene and would-be members like Ohio Senate candidate JD Vance, have made misleading statements about the slightly more than 700 people arrested for their roles in the attack, including describing them as \" political prisoners \" and claiming that they haven't been charged with crimes (they have).\n\nThe subtext of Trump's argument about fairness is particularly alarming, given the shocking violence directed against police defending the Capitol on January 6. By floating pardons should he regain office, Trump rewrites the limits of acceptable behavior for his supporters - and reinforces that those loyal to Trump are in the right and will be rewarded for their loyalty, while those who oppose his claims to power are not only wrong, but unprincipled.\n\n\"There is no room for dissenters from Donald Trump's views in the Republican Party,\" Alex Keyssar, a professor of history and social policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, told Vox in a Sunday interview.\n\nGaetz and Greene - both ardent supporters of Trump - are leading proponents of the narrative that January 6 attendees are being mistreated ( they're not ). Last summer , they, along with Reps. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) and Paul Gosar (R-AZ), visited a DC jail where some January 6 defendants were being held, demanding access as members of Congress and erroneously claiming they oversaw the budget for the jail, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe group, joined by Reps. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) and Bob Good (R-VA), also barged into the Justice Department this past summer, with Gosar calling January 6 defendants \"political prisoners\" and attempting to ask whether any of the defendants were being held in solitary confinement, the Washington Post's Meagan Flynn reported at the time.\n\nThe January 6 defendants are facing a variety of charges , ranging from obstructing an official proceeding of the government to seditious conspiracy . Some have already been convicted and sentenced ; as of the one-year anniversary of the attack, the longest sentence was just over five years in prison.\n\nAs Keyssar told Politico in a 2021 retrospective in December, the insurrection of January 6 accelerated \"the downward spiral of American political life\" and set off an \"intensified, rancorous struggle over the preservation of democratic values and institutions.\"\n\nTrump's insistence on pursuing his self-serving narrative of victimhood - and pulling the Republican Party along with him - doesn't just affect the GOP, as Keyssar points out; it ultimately affects the functioning of democracy and people's ability to participate in it. \"It's not just a matter of telling different stories,\" Keyssar told Vox on Sunday.\n\nSpecifically, he said, Trump's rhetoric around the insurrection is \"storytelling to justify a particular social order.\" According to Keyssar, the narratives forming around the insurrection echo the end of the Reconstruction period in the South following the Civil War. The Reconstruction era gave Black Americans unprecedented rights, power, and political representation for a brief period, until the end of the 19th century; in the decades following Reconstruction, the prevailing narrative among white Southerners was that the Civil War was an attack on Southerners' ways of life, and the Reconstruction period was the result of corrupt Northern \"carpetbaggers\" and \"scalawags\" taking over the remains of that society.\n\nAt the time, Keyssar said, the white Southern narrative argued that the disenfranchisement of Black Southerners and reinforcement of white supremacy \"had to be restored in order to have a 'good society' again.\" In the same vein now, Trump's fiction - that he was the true winner of the 2020 election and widespread fraud robbed him of a second term in office; that members of his own party who don't support his lies are unpatriotic; and that the people who protested and stormed the Capitol on January 6 aren't criminals - aims to restore him to power.\n\nJust because Trump's talking points around the 2020 election and the Republican Party's embrace of them aren't exactly unprecedented, that doesn't mean they aren't dangerous, Keyssar said.\n\nThe polarization of the two parties, and their dominance in state legislatures, has emboldened some places to propose laws targeting voter fraud - though there was no evidence of fraud in the 2020 election - which can have the real-world effect of making it more difficult for disenfranchised communities, including Black people and those in poverty, to vote.\n\nFurthermore, Keyssar said, the constant effort to delegitimize the election does serve to negate the peaceful means of changing power, which could portend further violence in one form or another. \"If you discredit the mechanism of elections,\" he said, \"then what are you left with? Force.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

      "text": "Here are the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nTen House Republicans broke with their party to support impeachment.\n\nby Li Zhou\n\nWhile House Republicans largely stood by President Donald Trump on Wednesday, a small - but significant - group of GOP lawmakers voted to impeach, making the push for his removal a bipartisan one.\n\nIn total, 10 Republicans including Reps. Liz Cheney (WY), John Katko (NY), and Adam Kinzinger (IL) voted in favor of an article of impeachment that charged Trump with inciting an insurrection. Multiple lawmakers emphasized that they were doing so because of Trump's attempts to interfere with the peaceful transfer of power - and his role in stoking violence during last week's attack on the Capitol.\n\nTheir support is notable and makes this impeachment vote the most bipartisan ever. It also marks a stark change from the previous impeachment when then-Rep. Justin Amash , a Republican-turned-independent, was the only non-Democrat to vote in favor of an article.\n\nCheney's stance, in particular, stands out given her position as the chair of the House Republican conference, and the third-highest-ranking GOP member in the lower chamber. She stressed that she is impeaching Trump for the actions he took to fuel the riot on January 6.\n\n\"The President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack,\" Cheney said in a statement . \"Everything that followed was his doing. None of this would have happened without the President.\" Five people have died due to injuries sustained during the storming of the Capitol last week.\n\nCheney's position differs from that of many House Republicans, who've urged \"unity\" and called for lawmakers to move on as a new administration gets underway. Her remarks have already prompted significant backlash from other representatives, including Trump allies Jim Jordan (R-OH) and Paul Gosar (R-AZ), who are now urging her to step down from her role in Republican leadership.\n\nThe fracturing within the House Republican conference underscores how the party remains split on its allegiance to Trump and the influence he will hold moving forward. Increasingly, a group of establishment Republicans in both the House and Senate are breaking with Trump following his attempts to challenge the election outcome, signaling a willingness by some members to turn away from him. Still, because of the support Trump holds with much of the Republican base, many lawmakers are continuing to side with the president.\n\nThe House approved the article of impeachment Wednesday afternoon, and it will soon head to the Senate - where no Republican senator has publicly supported Trump's conviction yet, though a few have called for his resignation. Below is a list of all the House Republicans who supported impeachment, and what some have said about it.\n\nWyoming Rep. Liz Cheney\n\n\"Much more will become clear in coming days and weeks, but what we know now is enough. The President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing. None of this would have happened without the President. The President could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence. He did not. There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution.\"\n\nNew York Rep. John Katko\n\n\"It cannot be ignored that President Trump encouraged this insurrection - both on social media ahead of January 6th, and in his speech that day. By deliberately promoting baseless theories suggesting the election was somehow stolen, the president created a combustible environment of misinformation, disenfranchisement, and division. When this manifested in violent acts on January 6th, he refused to promptly and forcefully call it off, putting countless lives in danger.\"\n\nIllinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger\n\n\"There is no doubt in my mind that the President of the United States broke his oath of office and incited this insurrection. He used his position in the Executive to attack the Legislative. So in assessing the articles of impeachment brought before the House, I must consider: if these actions-the Article II branch inciting a deadly insurrection against the Article I branch-are not worthy of impeachment, then what is an impeachable offense?\"\n\nMichigan Rep. Fred Upton\n\n\"Today the President characterized his inflammatory rhetoric at last Wednesday's rally as 'totally appropriate,' and he expressed no regrets for last week's violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. This sends exactly the wrong signal to those of us who support the very core of our democratic principles and took a solemn oath to the Constitution. I would have preferred a bipartisan, formal censure rather than a drawn-out impeachment process. I fear this will now interfere with important legislative business and a new Biden Administration. But it is time to say: Enough is enough.\"\n\nWashington Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler\n\n\"The President of the United States incited a riot aiming to halt the peaceful transfer of power from one administration to the next. ... The President's offenses, in my reading of the Constitution, were impeachable based on the indisputable evidence we already have. I understand the argument that the best course is not to further inflame the country or alienate Republican voters. But I am also a Republican voter. I believe in our Constitution, individual liberty, free markets, charity, life, justice, peace and this exceptional country. I see that my own party will be best served when those among us choose truth.\"\n\nWashington Rep. Dan Newhouse\n\n\"Turning a blind eye to this brutal assault on our Republic is not an option. A vote against this impeachment is a vote to validate the unacceptable violence we witnessed in our nation's capital. It is also a vote to condone President Trump's inaction.\"\n\nMichigan Rep. Peter Meijer\n\n\"I have wrestled with the division this vote will cause. I wrestled with the precedent it will establish and I have concerns with due process. ... With the facts at hand, I believe the article of impeachment to be accurate.\"\n\nOhio Rep. Anthony Gonzalez\n\n\"The President of the United States helped organize and incite a mob that attacked the United States Congress in an attempt to prevent us from completing our solemn duties as prescribed by the Constitution.\"\n\nSouth Carolina Rep.

      "text": "GOP congressman headlines conference where organizers push white nationalist rhetoric\n\nThe group's leader said of Jan. 6, \"We need a little bit more of that energy.\"\n\nGOP Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona was the surprise keynote speaker at a conference Friday night in Orlando, Florida, where speakers spread white nationalist rhetoric, organizers railed about the U.S. losing its \"white demographic core,\" and some called for further engagement like the ire that drove the Capitol attack on Jan. 6.\n\nGosar, who skipped Friday's House votes -- including the vote on the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package -- spoke Friday night at the America First Political Action Conference (AFPAC), where he blamed former President Donald Trump's election loss on \"big business, big tech, and the swamp,\" and pushed anti-immigration arguments to the crowd of \"Groypers,\" a loose coalition of mostly young alt-right extremists led by organizer Nick Fuentes.\n\nIn the days leading up to the event and while marketing tickets online in part by using his Twitter account, Fuentes teased that there would be a special guest, which turned out to be Gosar. Other speakers Friday night included former Iowa Representative Steve King, who's known for his long history of racist comments , and conservative commentator Michelle Malkin.\n\nAfter speaking at the event, less than 12 hours later Gosar was featured on a panel Saturday morning at the ongoing Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) happening concurrently to AFPAC in the Orlando area. Speaking on a panel moderated by CPAC's own Mercedes Schlapp, Gosar criticized the Biden administration's immigration policies.\n\nAt the start of the panel, Gosar -- unprompted and without mentioning Friday's event or Fuentes by name -- attempted to distance himself from \"racism.\"\n\n\"I want to tell you, I denounce when we talk about white racism. That's not appropriate. I believe in a strong immigration system,\" Gosar said.\n\nNeither Gosar nor representatives for CPAC responded to ABC News' requests for comment on the congressman's speech at the AFPAC event.\n\nOn Friday night, Gosar's keynote was followed by a speech by Fuentes that was filled with white grievance and far-right anti-immigration rhetoric. \"If [America] loses its white demographic core ... then this is not America anymore,\" the AFPAC founder told the crowd.\n\nFuentes went on to praise the Capitol attack, boasting about it leading to a delay in the certification of the election results.\n\n\"While I was there in D.C., outside of the building, and I saw hundreds of thousands of patriots surrounding the U.S. Capitol building and I saw the police retreating ... I said to myself: 'This is awesome,'\" Fuentes said to the applause of the crowd.\n\nAnd amid security concerns over threats to disrupt President Joe Biden's expected speech to a joint session of Congress, Fuentes encouraged more of the kind of commitment shown by rioters on Jan. 6.\n\n\"To see that Capitol under siege, to see the people of this country rise up and mobilize to D.C. with the pitchforks and the torches -- we need a little bit more of that energy in the future,\" he said.\n\nGosar, who was elected to Congress in 2011, has emerged as one of the most far-right Republicans in Washington. In January, The New York Times first reported that a leading member of an Oath Keepers chapter in Arizona, Jim Arroyo, posted a video on YouTube claiming Gosar attended one of their meetings and supported the group's calls for a war in the country.\n\n\"We did a meeting a couple of years ago where our elected representative from Washington, Paul Gosar, came out and we asked him flat out at that time, 'Do you think we're heading into a civil war?'\" Arroyo said. \"And his response was just flat out, 'We're in it. We just haven't started shooting at each other yet.'\" Gosar did not respond to the Times' request for comment.\n\nDuring the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, Gosar posted a message on Twitter calling for protesters not to \"get carried away.\" But over on the right-leaning Parler service, he shared a far more sympathetic message, using the same photo of people scaling the walls of the Capitol and writing, \"Americans are upset.\"\n\nGosar's featured appearance at Friday's event will be another major test for a Republican Party that is being pulled between traditional conservatives and a growing radical extremist element as it searches for a path forward following the pro-Trump Capitol attack.\n\nEarlier this month, the House approved a resolution that removed newly elected Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from her assigned committees due to a long history of pushing QAnon rhetoric and baseless conspiracy theories, including that the Sandy Hook and Parkland shootings were staged \"false flag\" operations. Green apologized to House members for her previous comments prior to the vote.\n\nAnd former President Trump issued the first blow of his revenge tour on Republicans who voted to impeach him, endorsing Max Miller, a former Trump aide, in his primary challenge against Rep. Anthony Gonzalez (R-Ohio), who was among 10 House Republicans to vote for impeachment.\n\nTrump's name was a recurring theme at Friday night's event, with Fuentes also promising to target Republicans who were not sufficiently loyal to the former president.\n\n\"He is one of us,\" Fuentes told the crowd.\n\nFriday night's AFPAC event marked one of the first major gatherings of far-right extremists since the Jan. 6 insurrection. The event featured at least two people, Fuentes and AFPAC speaker Vincent James Foxx, who were present near the Capitol building during the siege.\n\nFuentes, who has denied involvement in the storming of the Capitol itself, has been spotted in videos and photos rallying outside the Capitol on Jan. 6. In one video, Fuentes can be seen on a megaphone telling the crowd not to \"leave this Capitol until Donald Trump is inaugurated president.\" Foxx, who on Friday night said, \"We must not be afraid of the idea of secession,\" was photographed with Fuentes on Jan. 6. Neither man was charged in connection with the riot.\n\nFuentes, who attended the 2017 \"Unite the Right\" rally at Charlottesville, has a long history of making racist and anti-Semitic comments. Since the Capitol insurrection, a handful of America First followers have been arrested for their participation in the Jan. 6 attack.\n\nAfter spending parts of his speech Friday night celebrating the Capitol riot, Fuentes at one point attempted to walk back his comments.\n\n\"I disavow all violence. I disavow all vandalism. I respect the government is sovereign over us,\" he said -- then added, \"Alright, I think that'll stand up in court.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Paul Gosar and Marjorie Taylor Greene appeared at an event organized by a white nationalist, Republican party leaders are condemning them for attending.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell released a statement Monday criticizing white supremacist hate.\n\n\"There's no place in the Republican Party for white supremacists or anti-Semitism,\" McConnell said in a statement first reported by Politico.\n\nRepublican Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters Monday afternoon that he found Greene and Gosar's attendance \"unacceptable.\"\n\nMcCarthy suggested to reporters that he plans to speak with both Gosar and Greene later this week.\n\n\"To me, it was appalling and wrong,\" McCarthy told reporters. \"There's no place in our party for any of this.\"\n\n\"The party should not be associated any time any place with somebody who is anti-Semitic...This is unacceptable,\" he added.\n\nMcCarthy was in Israel last week with a congressional delegation. He told Punchbowl News that the news of Greene and Gosar's attendance was particularly upsetting because of his recent visit.\n\nGreene and Gosar have both previously been stripped of their committee assignments for their egregious behavior.\n\nMcCarthy, however, has previously said he would restore their assignments if Republicans take back the House in November.\n\nMcCarthy told CNN and another reporter outside his office that even though Greene claimed not to know who the event organizer was \"with that introduction, you should have walked off stage.\"\n\nShortly before introducing Greene, Nick Fuentes, the white nationalist who organized the event, led participants in applause for Russia's invasion of Ukraine and chanted Russian President Vladimir Putin's name.\n\nRepublican Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, when asked about Greene's behavior Monday, also condemned the event but stopped short of condemning her members.\n\n\"White supremacy. Neo Nazism, hate speech, and bigotry are disgusting. They have no place or home and our party.\"\n\nMcDaniel didn't say whether the party would take any further action against its members, such as censuring them. Instead, she said she \"would let the process play out\" and see if any members brought any censures forward at a party meeting in August.\n\nThe criticism follows recent comments by former President Donald Trump, who continues to praise Putin. During an interview with the conservative radio show \"The Clay Travis & Buck Sexton Show\" on Tuesday, Trump labeled Putin's tactics \"genius\" and \"savvy.\" Trump ultimately slammed the invasion on Saturday night at the Conservative Political Action Conference but called Putin \"smart.\"\n\nGreene and Gosar's appearance at the conference Friday night is now renewing calls for them to be reprimanded by fellow Republicans in Congress.\n\n\"In any other world, Greene speaking at a white supremacist conference where attendees have defended Vladimir Putin and praised Adolf Hitler would warrant expulsion from the caucus, to say nothing of her advocacy for violence and consistent anti-Semitism is disgusting,\" Democratic National Committee spokesperson Ammar Moussa said.\n\nGreene, however, has doubled down on her appearance.\n\n\"I won't cancel others in the conservative movement, even if I find some of their statements tasteless, misguided or even repulsive at times. I encourage them to seek wisdom, and apologize to those who have been hurt by their words, as I've had to do,\" she said. \"Our faith calls for charity and forgiveness.\"\n\n\"We're not going to be deterred by journalists and Washington insiders who fear the name of Our Lord, and relentlessly attack those of us who proclaim His name. We know that Christ is our only judge,\" she added.\n\nOver the weekend, in addition to claiming she didn't know who Fuentes was, Greene said she went to the event to reach his young audience and to discuss \"American First\" policies.\n\nLast month, Fuentes was subpoenaed by the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nABC News' Mariam Khan contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

It is a danger that it represents to everyone in the country,\" Pelosi said.\n\n\"When a member uses his or her national platform to encourage violence, tragically, people listen to those words,\" Pelosi added, before condemning House GOP leadership for, in her view, not holding their colleague accountable. \"It is sad that this entire House must take this step because of the refusal of the leadership of the other party.\"\n\nShe said it took nine days for Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy to speak out publicly about the incident and that when he did, he \"merely\" said there was no harm intended.\n\nSources confirmed to ABC News on Tuesday that Gosar apologized for the tweet behind closed doors during a GOP conference meeting. McCarthy said he had also spoken privately with Gosar about the tweet, but he did not appear to take further action against him.\n\nMcCarthy opposed the Democratic move to censure Gosar and remove him from his committee assignments, but instead of defending Gosar's actions ahead of the vote, he blasted Democrats for what he deemed was an overreach of power.\n\n\"The speaker is burning down the House on her way out the door,\" McCarthy said. \"Let me be clear. I do not condone violence, and representative Gosar has echoed that sentiment.\"\n\nGosar, speaking publicly about the video for the first time, which he said in an earlier statement was an attempt by his staff to reach a younger audience, said he doesn't condone violence but appeared to accept his fate as Democrats barrel towards the vote.\n\n\"I do not espouse violence or harm towards any member of Congress or Mr. Biden,\" Gosar said, notably not calling Biden \"president.\"\n\n\"If I must join Alexander Hamilton, the first person attempted to be censored by this House, so be it. It is done,\" he added.\n\nOcasio-Cortez urged her colleagues to vote \"yes\" and said the depictions are part of a larger trend of misogyny and racism in America.\n\n\"Can you find anyone in the chamber that finds this behavior acceptable?\" she asked her colleagues. \"Would you allow that in your home? Do you think this should happen on a school board...a church?\"\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said to reporters during a press call on Tuesday, \"I have never in 40 years seen such a vile, hateful, outrageous, dangerous, and inciting to violence against a colleague, ever.\"\n\n\"The fact that they would not take some action themselves or make some comments themselves, which I have not seen, is a testament that perhaps they are rationalizing, as they rationalize other items of criminal behavior, this particular action,\" Hoyer said of Republicans.\n\nThe resolution boots Gosar from the Oversight and Reform Committee, which he serves on alongside Ocasio-Cortez. It also removes him from the Committee on Natural Resources.\n\nLate Monday night, Pelosi told reporters it was up to McCarthy to rein in and reprimand his conference members -- but Democrats, outraged over Gosar's behavior, insisted on a floor vote. On Tuesday, she deemed the resolution as an appropriate measure.\n\n\"Why go after [Gosar]? Because he made threats, suggestions about harming a member of Congress...We cannot have members joking about murdering each other as well as threatening the president of the United States,\" Pelosi said.\n\nOnce a vote was imminent, Gosar on Tuesday seemed defiant, tweeting out a meme that says, \"God gives his hardest battles to his strongest soldiers.\"\n\nTwenty-three members of Congress have formerly been censured for misconduct, according to a 2016 Congressional Research Service Report.\n\nFormer Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y., was the last member of Congress to be censured -- in December 2010 -- accused of nearly a dozen ethics violations.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., for tweeting an edited Japanese cartoon showing him stabbing President Joe Biden and killing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.\n\nGosar on Monday tweeted the message, \"any anime fans out there?\" with what appeared to be an edited clip of the Japanese cartoon series \"Attack on Titan,\" in which the main characters fight off giants trying to exterminate humanity.\n\nThe edited clip of the show's opening credits depict Gosar and other GOP lawmakers flying through the air and stabbing giants with the faces of Biden and Ocasio-Cortez, in between images of Border Patrol officers with migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nGosar was immediately condemned by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Ocasio-Cortez and other Democrats, some of whom called for his expulsion from Congress and charged him with glorifying violence against the prominent Democrats.\n\nPelosi tweeted on Tuesday, \"Threats of violence against Members of Congress and the President of the United States must not be tolerated. @GOPLeader should join in condemning this horrific video and call on the Ethics Committee and law enforcement to investigate.\"\n\n\"For a Member of Congress to post a manipulated video on his social media accounts depicting himself killing Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking President Biden is a clear cut case for censure,\" Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., and other Democrats co-sponsoring her resolution wrote in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\"For that Member to post such a video on his official Instagram account and use his official congressional resources in the House of Representatives to further violence against elected officials goes beyond the pale.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez also denounced House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy for not publicly criticizing Gosar's actions. Aides to the California Republican did not respond to a message from ABC News seeking comment on the video.\n\nGosar eventually took down the tweet and video Tuesday night, after Twitter placed a public interest notice on the post. He said the video produced by his office was meant to \"symbolize the battle for the soul of America\" and was \"in no way intended to be a targeted attack against\" the Democrats.\n\n\"The cartoon depicts the symbolic nature of a battle between lawful and unlawful policies and in no way intended to be a targeted attack against Representative Cortez or Mr. Biden,\" Gosar said in a statement .\n\n\"It is a symbolic cartoon. It is not real life. Congressman Gosar cannot fly. The hero of the cartoon goes after the monster, the policy monster of open borders. I will always fight to defend the rule of law, securing our borders, and the America First agenda,\" the statement said.\n\nIf the censure resolution is taken up by the full House and approved by a majority of lawmakers present and voting, Gosar could be forced to stand in the center of the House chamber as the resolution condemning his actions are read aloud.\n\nIt's not yet clear if the House will take action against Gosar, who has courted controversy for spreading conspiracy theories about the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and appearing at a white nationalist event last winter -- though he distanced himself from the main organizer and his comments.\n\nTwenty-three members of Congress have been censured for misconduct, according to a 2016 Congressional Research Service Report.\n\nFormer Rep.

      "text": "Republican firebrands get prominent committee assignments, Santos awarded two seats\n\nThe White House criticized \"extreme MAGA members\" being appointed to oversight.\n\nUsing their new power after taking control of the House, Republicans have placed a number of controversial party figures on influential committees.\n\nReps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar, who were removed from their committee posts in the previous Congress over inflammatory statements, have received plum assignments on the powerful House Oversight Committee that is gearing up to investigate President Joe Biden , his family and his administration.\n\nCommittee assignments were a sticking point in Kevin McCarthy's battle for House speakership. Republican Reps. Lauren Boebert and Scott Perry, who initially opposed McCarthy's bid before flipping to his side, were also seated on the Oversight panel. Several of McCarthy's detractors received better assignments than they held in the previous Congress.\n\nThe White House, without naming names, on Wednesday slammed the appointment of hardliners to the House Oversight Committee. Spokesman Ian Sams said the party was \"handing the keys of oversight to the most extreme MAGA members of the Republican caucus who promote violent rhetoric and dangerous conspiracy theories.\"\n\nEmbattled Rep. George Santos also received two assignments on lower-level committees despite facing calls to resign and numerous investigations after admitting to fabricating much of his resume.\n\nAt the same time, McCarthy plans to keep Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell off the House Intelligence Committee and Rep. Ilhan Omar from serving on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nHere's what to know about the new committee assignments:\n\nGreene's placement on the panel comes after she pledged her support to McCarthy and criticized the other hard-line members of the House Freedom Caucus who were blocking McCarthy's path to the gavel. Greene also received a spot on the Homeland Security Committee.\n\nHer placements come after she was stripped of her assignments in the previous Democrat-controlled House over her past inflammatory posts on social media. Before being elected, she liked posts advocating for political violence against Democrats and embracing numerous conspiracy theories about 9/11 and school shootings.\n\n\"Joe Biden, be prepared,\" Greene said in a statement about her appointment to the House Oversight Committee.\n\nGosar, too, was removed from his committee assignments by Democrats after he tweeted an altered anime video that depicted him killing Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and swinging two swords at Biden.\n\nWhile the White House didn't call out specific members, Sams noted the new members of the committee include individuals who \"suggested violence against political opponents, with one drawing a bipartisan censure from the House. They have defended and downplayed a violent insurrection against our democracy, and one defied a subpoena in an investigation of his own involvement in January 6.\"\n\nSantos will serve on the Small Business Committee, despite his lies about a career on Wall Street , and the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.\n\nSantos has been under scrutiny for lying about much of his resume, including falsely claiming he worked at Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. He's also the target of numerous complaints alleging misuse of campaign finances and other violations of campaign finance law.\n\nAt least seven Republican members of the House have called on Santos to resign, but leadership has stuck by the congressman so far. McCarthy said he has a right to serve despite the mounting controversy.\n\nMost of the 20 Republicans who repeatedly voted against McCarthy for speaker have received committee assignments, and some received positions on more influential panels.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, perhaps McCarthy's biggest opponent during the speakership showdown, will continue to serve on the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nBoebert, another vocal McCarthy critic who voted \"present\" rather than for McCarthy on the final speakership ballots, was awarded a new seat on the House Oversight Committee. She will also keep her seat on the Committee on Natural Resources.\n\nRep. Anna Paulina Luna, a new congresswoman from Florida, will also serve on the House Oversight Committee.\n\nRep. Byron Donalds, who was offered as a GOP alternative to McCarthy on numerous ballots, was elected to serve again on the House Oversight Committee and received a new seat on the House Committee on Financial Services.\n\nReps. Andrew Clyde and Michael Cloud, also McCarthy detractors, won seats on the House Appropriations Committee.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "The Rookies: Paul Gosar On the Rise in Arizona\n\nPaul Gosar sold his dental practice to run for a congressional seat in Arizona.\n\nOct. 14, 2010 -- Paul Gosar is not your everyday candidate for Congress.\n\nAsked if his opponent in Arizona -- Democratic incumbent Ann Kirkpatrick -- should fear him, he exclaims, \"Afraid of me as a candidate? Danger, Will Robinson, danger!\" quoting a catchphrase from the 1960s TV series \"Lost in Space.\"\n\nThat was just one of many off-the-cuff quips from Gosar in a wide-ranging 30-minute interview with ABC News. It is clear that Gosar, a dentist for the last 25 years, is one of the most colorful candidates looking to secure a seat on Capitol Hill this fall.\n\nRated one of the Republican Party's \"Young Guns\" -- a group of the GOP's most electable challengers -- Gosar is making a strong push to unseat Kirkpatrick in Arizona's First Congressional District, running especially hard against the Democrats' most recent signature legislative achievement: health care reform .\n\n\"What better time to have a doctor in the house?\" he says. \"If it's meant to be, it's meant to be. Sometimes it's a leap of faith.\"\n\nBut ask him why voters should send him to Washington, he points to personal, rather than political experience.\n\n\"I'm a person that has lived in Main Street America,\" he explains. \"I'm a family man. I've got a wonderful wife and family. I've got kids that have gone through the school districts. I've started two small businesses. I've built my own house. And I'm a healthcare provider. Oh my God! A lot of these things come home to roost. I'm self-made. I'm a citizen. And I live in this district.\"\n\nGosar might not be a seasoned politician, but that's not viewed as a bad thing these days. Now, having sold his practice to pursue his political goals, he is riding a wave of Tea Party momentum as far as it will take him. In a district that has been held by a Republican for much of the past decade, Gosar is hitting out at Kirkpatrick for voting in favor of the new health care reform law and the economic stimulus package .\n\nIn recent ads, Gosar has denounced Kirkpatrick as \"a rubber stamp for the Obama-Pelosi agenda\" and \"another big spender who's turned her back on the voters.\" \"It's time for her to go,\" he states.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

In the cartoon, Gosar is portrayed as a sword-wielding character who slashes at a figure with Ocasio-Cortez's face with his weapons from behind, causing the character to collapse to the ground. Then, with a sword in each hands, Gosar is depicted charging toward Mr. Biden and raising his arms in attack.\n\nJust 23 other members of Congress in U.S. history have been censured, the most severe punishment a lawmaker can face short of expulsion, with the most recent being Democratic Congressman Charles Rangel of New York in 2010 for ethics violations .\n\nAhead of the vote, Ocasio-Cortez criticized Republicans for failing to denounce Gosar's actions and asked her fellow lawmakers, \"Does anyone in this chamber find this behavior acceptable?\"\n\n\"What is so hard about saying that this is wrong?\" she said in a speech from the House floor. \"This is not about me. This is not about Representative Gosar. But this is about what we are willing to accept.\"\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez calls out House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy for not condemning Rep. Paul Gosar posting an anime video showing him killing her: \"What is so hard about saying that this is wrong?\" She says the censure vote for Gosar is \"about what we are willing to accept.\" pic.twitter.com/9mz5s0AC7n\n\nBut Gosar defended himself, arguing he does not \"espouse violence toward anyone.\" He did not apologize to Ocasio-Cortez and instead said he \"self-censored\" by removing the portrayal from his social media accounts on his own accord after learning his colleagues felt threatened by it.\n\n\"There is no threat in the cartoon other than the threat that immigration poses to our country, and no threat was intended by my staff or me,\" the Arizona lawmaker said in floor remarks, likening himself to Alexander Hamilton at the conclusion of his remarks.\n\nThe move by the House to discipline the Arizona Republican was the latest undertaken by the Democratic majority in response to violent statements promoted by GOP lawmakers. In February, the House voted to remove Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene from her committees after extremist and racist comments she posted to social media before she was elected to Congress surfaced.\n\nDemocrats have said such action against those Republicans was warranted as their conduct promotes violence against members of Congress and GOP congressional leaders have failed to discipline their colleagues on their own.\n\nBut Republicans warn that Democrats are now paving the way for them to respond in kind when the GOP retakes control of the House.\n\n\"Today's action once again tramples on the traditional norms of the House: The idea that the majority and the minority have the right to appoint their own members to committees as they see fit,\" Congressman Tom Cole of Oklahoma, the top Republican on the House Rules Committee, said from the House floor. \"It sets a dangerous and disturbing precedent that will likely change the character of the House in the years to come, and not for the better.\"\n\nBut Pelosi said the censure resolution against Gosar was about \"workplace harassment and violence against women.\" She also condemned House Republican leadership for failing to discipline Gosar on their own, saying it is \"sad that this entire House must take this step\" because of their refusal to respond.\n\n\"These actions demand a response,\" Pelosi said. \"We cannot have a member joking about murdering each other or threatening the president of the United States. This is both an endangerment of our elected officials and an insult to the institution of the House of Representatives.\"\n\nIn response, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy accused Pelosi of \"burning down the House on her way out the door\" and claimed Democrats are abusing their power by removing Gosar from his committees.\n\nGosar has been in Congress since 2011 and serves on the House Oversight and Reform Committee alongside Ocasio-Cortez, as well as the House Natural Resources Committee. Across his six terms in Congress, he has raised eyebrows for social media posts and promotion of conspiracy theories, including that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.\n\nGosar objected to the electoral votes from his home state of Arizona during the joint session of Congress on January 6 and has claimed Ashli Babbitt, an Air Force veteran who was fatally shot when she tried to jump through a broken window outside the House chamber during the January 6 assault, was \"executed.\"\n\nThe U.S. Capitol Police cleared the officer who killed Babbitt and said he acted lawfully and within department policy.\n\nGosar's video last week was met with swift condemnation from congressional Democrats. He removed the post after receiving a call from McCarthy, who told him the cartoon was inappropriate, and said in a statement he does not \"espouse violence or harm towards any member of Congress or Mr. Biden.\"\n\nGosar also appeared behind closed doors before his fellow House Republicans on Tuesday, Cole said, and insisted to his colleagues that the video was intended to symbolize the policies he opposes and was not meant for it to be an endorsement of violence.\n\nThe Arizona Republican, however, downplayed the controversy in a tweet.\n\nMelissa Quinn is a politics reporter for CBSNews.com.

Paul Gosar of Arizona announced he was signing onto the motion to vacate against Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, after the House advanced a foreign aid package with more Democratic votes than Republican support.\n\n\"I have added my name in support of the motion to vacate the Speaker,\" Gosar said in a statement. \"Our border cannot be an afterthought. We need a Speaker who puts America first rather than bending to the reckless demands of the warmongers, neo-cons and the military industrial complex making billions from a costly and endless war half a world away.\"\n\nA number of right-wing hardliners have lashed out at Johnson for omitting border security provisions from the package. The House is expected to vote on final passage on the legislation, which includes aid for Israel, Ukraine, the Indo-Pacific region and other foreign policy priorities, on Saturday.\n\nThe effort to oust Johnson has been spearheaded by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia. She has dangled the threat over his head for weeks, warning him against holding a vote on funding for Ukraine, but she has so far not moved to force a vote and has not said when she would. Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky is also supporting the resolution.\n\nGreene said Thursday she had not forced the vote yet because \"I'm a responsible person.\"\n\n\"I'm not acting out of emotions or rash feelings or anger,\" she said. \"I'm doing this the right way.\"\n\nAhead of Friday's procedural vote, Johnson said he was not worried about his job.\n\n\"I don't worry,\" he said. \"I just do my job.\"\n\nJohnson said Wednesday he had not asked Democrats to help him.\n\n\"I have not asked a single Democrat to get involved in that at all,\" he said. \"I do not spend time walking around thinking about the motion to vacate. I have a job to do here, and I'm going to do the job, regardless of personal consequences, that's what we're supposed to do. If Marjorie brings the motion, she brings the motion and we'll let the chips fall where they may.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries wouldn't explicitly say Friday whether Democrats will bail him out, saying the caucus \"will have a conversation about how to deal with any hypothetical motion to vacate, which at this point hasn't been noticed.\"\n\n\"Marjorie Taylor Greene, Massie and Gosar are quite a group,\" the New York Democrat said. \"I'm sure that will play some role in our conversation. But central to the conversation, the prerequisite to the conversation, is to make sure that the national security legislation in totality is passed by the House of Representatives.\"\n\nNikole Killion, Ellis Kim, Jaala Brown and Laura Garrison contributed reporting.\n\nCaitlin Yilek is a politics reporter at CBSNews.com, based in Washington, D.C.

Dave Gosar told CBSN's Elaine Quijano in an interview Wednesday evening that he started to notice \"unhinged behavior\" from his brother at the end of former President Obama's second term.\n\nIn 2018, the congressman's siblings began to speak out against him. Dave Gosar says their decision was fueled by their brother's antisemitic rhetoric. That year, six of Paul Gosar's ten siblings campaigned against their brother when he was up for reelection.\n\nSpeaking in a video campaign for Gosar's Democrat opponent David Brill, Dave Gosar said the siblings had to \"stand up for our good name.\"\n\nSince then, Dave Gosar has criticized his brother's handling of the coronavirus pandemic . In the NBC piece, he said he was bothered when Paul Gosar called the initial response to COVID-19 \"overblown.\"\n\nDave Gosar also believes his brother, a loyal supporter of former President Trump, played a role in the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol .\n\n\"It's just lunacy, it's not politics,\" Dave Gosar told CBSN.\n\nEarlier this year, a Democratic congresswoman released a nearly 2,000-page report examining lawmakers social media and misinformation about the 2020 election that found that Paul Gosar's social media posts \"include phony allegations of his own state 'stealing' the election, and support for protests against local election officials. He wrote in one post that officials who were 'stealing' votes were committing 'sedition and treason.'\"\n\nPaul Gosar's office did not comment on the report.\n\nIn Dave Gosar's opinion, many Republicans believe that if they don't follow Mr. Trump, then they will alienate his base supporters.\n\n\"It's a cult,\" Dave Gosar said about the Republican Party.\n\nPaul Gosar's rhetoric and politics have left the Gosar family deeply divided, his brother said. Of the 10 siblings, he said six have spoken out against their lawmaker brother. Dave Gosar said three of his brothers, as well as their parents, who are Trump supporters, have stayed silent.\n\n\"It's not been fun,\" Dave Gosar said. \"None of us like to do this. Every time we do one of these interviews, we feel like we're doing the right thing but it still leaves a bad taste in your mouth.\"\n\nDave Gosar said he hasn't spoken to his brother in five years. But, he and his five siblings have chosen to publicly rebuke their brother because they have a \"duty to speak out\" And, he said, he hoped that \"by speaking out, other people in the same situation would also be embolden to speak out.\"\n\n\"What am I supposed to do as an American?\" Dave Gosar asked. \"I would encourage more people to speak out.\"\n\nSophie Reardon is a News Editor at CBS News.

The congressman then appeared to remove the post from his Twitter feed.\n\nWith the House's vote Wednesday afternoon, Gosar became the 24th member of Congress in U.S. history to be censured, the most severe punishment a lawmaker can face short of expulsion. In addition to the formal rebuke of the congressman, he was also stripped of his assignments to the House Oversight and Reform Committee, on which Ocasio-Cortez also serves, and Natural Resources Committee.\n\nThe move to censure Gosar stemmed from an edited anime video the congressman shared to his official social media accounts last week, which racked up more than 3 million views before he removed the posts.

Paul Gosar harshly criticized after tweeting altered animation showing him attacking Ocasio-Cortez and Biden\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nNovember 9, 2021 / 7:34 AM EST / CBS/AP\n\nArizona Representative Paul Gosar was facing criticism after he tweeted a video that included altered animation showing him striking Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a sword.\n\nThe video also shows him apparently set to attack President Biden with a weapon that appears to be a club or a sword.\n\nIn a tweet Monday night, Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, referred to Gosar as \"a creepy member I work with\" and said he \"shared a fantasy video of him killing me.\" She added that Gosar would face no consequences because Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy \"cheers him on with excuses.\" She also said institutions \"don't protect\" women of color.\n\nA fellow House Democrat, Ted Lieu of California, referred to Gosar's tweet as \"sick behavior\" and said in a tweet of his own: \"In any workplace in America, if a coworker made an anime video killing another coworker, that person would be fired.\"\n\nAnother House Democrat from California, Eric Swalwell tweeted, \"Happy Monday in America, where @GOPLeader McCarthy's colleague just posted a video of himself swinging two swords at President Biden. These blood thirsty losers are more comfortable with violence than voting. Keep exposing them.\"\n\nIn a statement to The Washington Post, Gosar's digital director, Jessica Lycos, tossed aside assertions that the video glorifies violence, saying, \"Everyone needs to relax.\"\n\nGosar, a Republican, posted the video Sunday with a note saying: \"Any anime fans out there?\"\n\nThe roughly 90-second video is an altered version of a Japanese anime series, interspersed with shots of border patrol officers and migrants at the southern U.S. border.\n\nDuring one roughly 10-second section of the video, animated characters whose faces have been replaced with Gosar and fellow Republican Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Lauren Boebert of Colorado are seen fighting other animated characters.\n\nIn one scene, Gosar's character is seen striking the one made to look like Ocasio-Cortez in the back of the neck with a sword.\n\nTwitter later attached a warning to the tweet saying it \"violated the Twitter Rules about hateful conduct. However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public's interest for the Tweet to remain accessible.\"\n\nGosar is known as an ardent ally of former President Donald Trump. He was among the lawmakers whose phone or computer records a House panel investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection asked social media and telecommunications companies to preserve as they were potentially involved with efforts to \"challenge, delay or interfere\" with the certification of the 2020 election or otherwise try to overturn its results.\n\n© 2021 CBS Interactive Inc.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, Paul Gosar and George Santos receive House committee seats\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nJanuary 17, 2023 / 7:27 PM EST / CBS News\n\nWashington - Once stripped of their committee assignments by the Democratic-controlled House over controversial social media posts, Republican Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar has been installed on House panels by GOP leaders for the new Congress.\n\nGreene, of Georgia, will serve on the Homeland Security Committee, her office confirmed, while Gosar, of Arizona, will return to the Natural Resources Committee, according to a release from the committee.\n\nGreene issued a statement on Tuesday indicating she would be joining the Oversight and Accountability Committee, although House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told reporters Tuesday that assignments for that committee hadn't yet been chosen yet. The Oversight and Accountability launched an investigation into President Biden's handling of documents marked classified discovered at his former office at a Washington think tank and his Wilmington, Delaware, home .\n\nMcCarthy told reporters that Rep. George Santos, the embattled New York Republican under scrutiny from federal and local investigators, will be added to the Small Business and Science committees.\n\nSeveral of Santos's GOP colleagues from the New York congressional delegation have called on him to resign amid growing questions about his professional experience, background and finances. Santos has rebuffed calls to step down, and House GOP leaders have said his future in Congress is up to New York voters.\n\nMcCarthy's election to House speaker earlier this month paved the way for top Republicans to begin selecting committee chairs and panel membership. The language of bills gets hashed out in committees, and committee chairs - who are almost always from the majority party - decide which bills to consider.\n\nDuring the speaker's election, Greene split from some of her conservative House Freedom Caucus colleagues and was a vocal defender of McCarthy's bid for the gavel.\n\nAsked about Greene's placement on the Homeland Security panel, McCarthy said he thinks it's \"great.\"\n\nWhen Democrats controlled the House in the last Congress, it held separate votes to remove Greene and Gosar from their respective committees due to incendiary comments they made on social media.\n\nIn Greene's case, the House voted to remove her from the Budget panel and Education and Labor Committee after extremist and racist comments she posted to social media before she was elected to Congress surfaced. Greene lost her committee spots just a month after she was sworn in as a House member, and 11 Republicans joined all Democrats in voting to strip the Georgia lawmaker of her assignments.\n\nGosar, meanwhile, was censured by the House in November 2021 and lost his seats on the Oversight and Reform Committee and Natural Resources panel after he posted an edited anime video to his social media accounts depicting violence against Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and President Biden.\n\nTwo Republicans - then.-Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois -  joined all the House Democrats in voting to punish Gosar for sharing the violent video.\n\nZak Hudak contributed to this report.\n\nMelissa Quinn is a politics reporter for CBSNews.com.

      "text": "Rep. Paul Gosar's lengthy ties to White nationalists, pro-Nazi blogger and far-right fringe received little pushback for years\n\nLast spring, Republican Rep. Paul Gosar and a small group of volunteers traveled to the southern border city of San Luis, Arizona, to clean up the city's trash.\n\nThe small group included a blogger who has praised Nazi Germany; a Gosar-endorsed congressional candidate who would be removed from Twitter for calling for executing election officials; and a speaker removed from the 2020 Republican National Convention for sharing an antisemitic conspiracy theory describing an elaborate Jewish plan for global domination.\n\nSince 2018, when Gosar dined with a European extremist who called for banning Islam from Europe, the far-right Arizona lawmaker has boosted the profiles of local antisemites, attended a conference organized by a prominent White nationalist, and repeatedly shared content from a Holocaust denial website.\n\nGosar is now facing scrutiny over his ties to extremists after speaking via video at a conference organized by White nationalist Nick Fuentes. Gosar spoke in person at the event last year. And both Gosar, and his colleague Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who spoke in person at the conference this year, have been condemned by Republican leaders over their appearances.\n\nGosar has also shared animated images of political violence against his colleagues. In November, Gosar shared a photoshopped anime video on social media showing him appearing to kill New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking President Joe Biden. He was then censured by the House and stripped of his committee assignments, but only two Republicans - Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger and Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney - voted to censure Gosar for promoting violence.\n\nRepublican leadership has yet to discipline Gosar, or Greene for that matter, for their ties to White nationalists beyond harsh words, even though, three years ago, they stripped another congressman from House committees for lamenting that the terms White nationalist and White supremacist were considered \"offensive.\"\n\nGosar's ties to extremists go back further than the violent social media posts he was censured for. He has long associations with White nationalists, a pro-Nazi blogger and far-right fringe players that have received little examination compared to his colleagues, according to an extensive CNN KFile review of Gosar's events and social media posts over the years.\n\nHis endorsement, along with Greene's, has become highly sought after in local and national political primaries by like-minded candidates.\n\nA spokesperson for Gosar declined to comment on specific questions about the congressman's associates and instead offered a statement disparaging CNN's reporting.\n\nIn his home state, Gosar engaged with local far-right Arizona figures, including sharing a post from Kyle Clifton, who has shared antisemitic images, and appeared in photos with Greyson Arnold, who has expressed admiration for Nazi Germany .\n\nThe April 2021 trip Gosar took to the border included Arnold , a far-right blogger who has shared a post saying \"Jewish led colored hordes\" are fighting the \"White Christian West.\" Arnold has repeatedly shared content saying the US fought on the wrong side in World War II , spread antisemitic conspiracy theories and falsely claimed there were \"Jewish plans to genocide the German people.\" He recently shared posts questioning teaching of the Holocaust, calling it the original \"critical race theory.\"\n\nArnold regularly posts on the social media site Telegram under the moniker \"Pure Politics.\" He wrote on Telegram he was invited by Gosar to the trip, and can be seen in various photos from attendees documenting the visit, which Gosar said was to pick up trash he claimed was left by \"illegal aliens pouring over our border.\"\n\nThe trip also included right-wing activist Mary Ann Mendoza, who was abruptly pulled from speaking at the Republican National Convention in 2020 after she spread an antisemitic conspiracy theory describing an elaborate Jewish plan for global domination. She later deleted the tweet and claimed that she hadn't read \"every post within the thread.\" \"My apologies for not paying attention to the intent of the whole message,\" Mendoza said. \"That does not reflect my feelings or personal thoughts whatsoever.\"\n\nAnother attendee, congressional candidate Jarome Bell, would later be banned from Twitter for calling for executing election officials. He had previously posted in 2020 his partial support of instituting martial law and arresting people for \"treason and sedition\" after the 2020 election.\n\nIn October 2020, Gosar was interviewed by Arnold during an event in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, where he told Arnold, \"We really are in a civil war. It's just that the gunfire hasn't started.\" And this past January, Gosar shared on his Instagram page a photo posted from Arnold at an event with Gosar this year.\n\nJared Holt, a fellow at the Atlantic Council and an expert on domestic extremism, told CNN that politicians like Gosar and Greene speaking and associating with these figures and groups gives those ideas new credibility and legitimacy.\n\nOn social media, Gosar regularly engages with far-right personalities and memes. Gosar has repeatedly promoted the work of and tagged Vincent James Foxx, who was recently banned from Twitter and has a history of deeply antisemitic statements. The Anti-Defamation League has labeled Foxx as a White supremacist.\n\nGosar shared on Instagram a screenshot of himself with Ethan Schmidt-Crockett, who harassed a store specializing in wigs for cancer patients last summer because it required customers to wear masks and is the founder of the AntiMaskersClub. Schmidt-Crockett was recently banned from the Arizona House after harassing a Democratic lawmaker by using a racial slur. In a video of Gosar and Schmidt-Crockett posted in December 2021, Gosar encourages the \"Anti Vaxxers Club\" to stay the course.\n\nIn November 2020, Gosar credited Mike Cernovich with a Phoenix \"Stop the Steal\" rally after the 2020 election, comparing Cernovich to civil rights icon Rosa Parks.\n\nCernovich, a far-right commentator, is best known for his role peddling far-right conspiracy theories, including \" Pizzagate ,\" which bizarrely and falsely claimed Hillary Clinton and her campaign chairman John Podesta were connected to a pedophilia ring run in a Washington, DC, pizza restaurant. The incident came to a head in December 2016 when a man fired an AR-15 inside the restaurant, saying he was attempting to find and rescue child sex slaves he believed were being held there. No one was injured.\n\nGosar has also shared a column on Twitter from the UNZ Review, a website that has published Holocaust denialism and columns in support of White nationalism.\n\nHe has shared a political consultant, Noel Fritsch, on his political campaigns with Paul Nehlen , the racist and antisemitic candidate who attempted to primary then-House Speaker Paul Ryan. The same consultant advised Bell, and Lauren Witzke, a 2020 congressional candidate who embraced the QAnon conspiracy theory.\n\nGosar has also regularly appeared on fringe media, like the radio show of Dr. Bill Deagle, a conspiracy theorist who says the government created AIDS - and said such in his interview with Gosar to no pushback. He has also appeared multiple times on and shared content from the show of Stew Peters, a right-wing conspiracy theorist who has on multiple occasions called for hanging Dr. Anthony Fauci.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Paul Gosar has a lonnnnnng history of controversy\n\nThe US House is set to hold a censure vote against Arizona Republican Rep. Paul Gosar on Wednesday in reaction to a photoshopped anime video he posted on Twitter in which he is shown killing New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and threatening President Joe Biden.\n\nWhile this is the highest-profile incident involving Gosar - and one that could cost him his seats on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform and the House Committee on Natural Resources - it's FAR from the only time Gosar has drawn negative attention to himself during his decade in Congress.\n\nConsider:\n\n* Following the white supremacist rally and violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in the summer of 2017, Gosar suggested that the gathering was, in fact, \"created by the left\" and organized by \"an Obama sympathizer.\"  He also suggested that George Soros, the liberal billionaire, had something to do with funding the neo-Nazi rally. \"You know George Soros is one of those people that actually helps back these individuals,\" Gosar told Vice News .\n\n* The day after Arizona Sen. John McCain was diagnosed with brain cancer, Gosar's chief of staff sent a text message to a lawyer for Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey expressing the congressman's interest in being appointed to the seat. \"To anyone who uses this as an opportunity to speculate or fan the rumor mill: Washington DC's obsession with this when there is no issue to be discussed is disgraceful,\" said a spokesman for the governor .\n\n* When several Democrats announced their plans to bring \"Dreamers\" - children of undocumented immigrants born in the United States - to then-President Donald Trump's 2018 State of the Union speech, Gosar said that he had asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions as well as the Capitol Police to \" consider checking identification . . . and arresting any illegal aliens in attendance .\"\n\n* In a 2018 congressional hearing with former FBI agent Peter Strzok, Gosar told the witness : \"This morning I watched - by the way I'm a dentist. I read body language very well.\"\n\n* In 2018, six of Gosar's nine siblings appeared in ads for his Democratic opponent. \"Paul's absolutely not working for his district,\" one of his brothers said in the commercial . In response, Gosar offered up this: \"These disgruntled Hillary suppporters (sic) are related by blood to me but like leftists everywhere, they put political ideology before family. Lenin, Mao and Kim Jung (sic) Un would be proud.\"\n\nTHE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\n* In September, Gosar, who has been a fierce backer of Trump's lie that the 2020 election was stolen, called for a re-run of the 2020 presidential election in Arizona . \"My suggestion is that we actually have some hearings and look over this batch and set a new election for Biden and Trump before the end of the year,\" he said.\n\nThere's more, but you get the idea.\n\nWhile House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has not publicly condemned Gosar's decision to post the photoshopped video, the Arizona Republican's penchant for controversy - and unwillingness to play nice with party leaders - has cost him in the past. Gosar was passed over for the top spot on the Oversight Committee in June 2020 despite being the committee's most senior Republican. The same thing happened to Gosar later that year when, despite again being the most senior Republican on the Natural Resources Committee , he was passed over for the top ranking job .\n\nAt the same time, despite all of that controversy, Gosar has easily beaten back primary challenges. As the Arizona Republic noted in 2018 : \"Two years of controversial comments and stinging attack ads from most of his siblings seem to have done little to dent Gosar's support in Arizona's most-Republican-leaning district.\" In 2020, Gosar won the Republican primary with 63% of the vote against a challenger who said Gosar was not supportive enough of Trump.\n\nCould being stripped of his committee assignments - as seems likely with Democrats in control of the House - change how district voters see Gosar? Or could it encourage an ambitious Republican to make a primary challenge in 2022 - arguing that Gosar is no longer able to best serve the district?\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

      "text": "House votes to censure and remove Gosar from committees over violent video targeting AOC and Biden\n\nThe House of Representatives voted Wednesday to approve a resolution that censures Rep. Paul Gosar and strips him of his two committee assignments, the first time a sitting House member has been censured in more than 10 years.\n\nThe action led by House Democrats represents a major rebuke to the Arizona Republican for posting a photoshopped anime video to social media showing him appearing to kill Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking President Joe Biden.\n\nThe final vote was 223 to 207. Republicans Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and Liz Cheney of Wyoming voted with all the Democrats for the censure resolution . Republican Rep. David Joyce of Ohio voted present, meaning he took no position either way.\n\nGosar took down the video after facing criticism but did not apologize. About an hour after being censured, Gosar retweeted a tweet praising him that also included the video.\n\nHouse Democrats have made clear they believe he must face significant consequences for his actions, while many Republicans have argued Democrats are setting a dangerous precedent that could be used against them in the future.\n\nThe episode underscores and threatens to worsen the rising tensions and deepening distrust between Democrats and Republicans in Congress.\n\nA censure resolution is the most severe form of punishment in the House, and stripping a member of committee assignments deprives them of a powerful platform to influence legislation and give voice to constituent priorities.\n\nThe resolution approved by the House will remove Gosar from the House Oversight and Reform Committee, which Ocasio-Cortez also serves on, and the Natural Resources Committee.\n\n\"We cannot have a member joking about murdering each other or threatening the President of the United States,\" Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a floor speech.\n\n\"Disguising death threats as a video doesn't make it less real,\" she said. \"It's a sad day for the House of Representatives, but a necessary day.\"\n\nHouse GOP leader Kevin McCarthy accused Democrats of hypocrisy, arguing that they have not responded to members of their own party in the same way.\n\nMcCarthy went on to suggest that Republicans will use the standard that has been set to rebuke Democrats if they retake the majority. \"Under the Pelosi precedent, all the members that I have mentioned earlier will need the approval of a majority to keep those positions in the future.\"\n\nIn remarks on the House floor ahead of the vote, Gosar was defiant.\n\n\"For this cartoon, some in the current Congress suggest I should be punished. I have said decisively there is no threat in the cartoon other than the threat that immigration poses to our country. And no threat was intended by my staff or me,\" he said.\n\n\"I voluntarily took the cartoon down not because it was itself a threat, but because some thought it was. Out of compassion for those who generally felt offense, I self-censored\" Gosar said.\n\nApproval of a censure resolution represents a dramatic moment on the House floor. The last time a member was censured was in 2010, when former Democratic Rep. Charlie Rangel of New York was censured by his own party over various ethics violations.\n\nAfter the resolution is adopted, the lawmaker who is being reprimanded is required to stand in the well of the House while the resolution is read out loud by whoever is presiding over the chamber.\n\nFollowing passage of the measure, Pelosi asked Gosar to present himself. She then read out the censure and announced the congressman's removal from committee assignments.\n\nWhen Gosar stood in the well as Pelosi read the censure to him, a group of Republicans joined him. Ocasio-Cortez and Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters of California were sitting in the front row as the censure was read .\n\nIn a statement released after the censure, Gosar continued to defend his actions. \"President Trump called me his 'warrior' for a reason,\" he said. \"I have been fighting for America First and against the Democrats' efforts to destroy this country with open borders, drugs, illegal immigration and human trafficking all condoned and initiated by the Biden administration.\"\n\nJoyce, the Ohio Republican who voted present, explained his vote in a statement.\n\nCiting that he is a member of the House Ethics Committee, the congressman said, \"I may deem it appropriate to vote present on legislation related to matters that are or could come before the Committee.\"\n\nHe went on to say, \"I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to allow the Ethics Committee to do its job and address any alleged violations of the U.S. House of Representatives' rules or any related conduct by House Members, officers, or employees.\"\n\nThe move to censure Gosar follows a lack of action from Republican leadership in the House. McCarthy, who had not commented publicly on the Gosar episode until this week, has said that after the tweet he had called the Arizona Republican, who then deleted it, but he did not explicitly condemn Gosar's behavior.\n\nMcCarthy said Gosar had explained his actions during a closed-door conference meeting on Tuesday morning, and his explanation was well received in the conference, according to attendees.\n\n\"He didn't see it before it posted. It was not his intent to show any harm,\" McCarthy told reporters. \"What I said to conference was (we) cannot accept any action or showing of a violence to another member.\"\n\nAmid a backlash against the video, the congressman issued a statement on the video, saying that it \"was not meant to depict any harm or violence against anyone portrayed\" and calling it \"a symbolic portrayal of a fight over immigration policy.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez spoke out against Gosar's actions and inaction by House GOP leadership in remarks on the House floor ahead of the vote.\n\n\"In response to the Republican leader's remarks when he says that this action is unprecedented: What I believe is unprecedented is for a member of House leadership of either party to be unable to condemn incitement of violence against a member of this body,\" she said.\n\n\"Our work here matters. Our example matters. There is meaning in our service and as leaders in this country when we incite violence with depictions against our colleagues that trickles down into violence in this country,\" she said.\n\n\"It's pretty cut and dry. Does anyone in this chamber find this behavior acceptable?\"\n\nPelosi said on Wednesday that Gosar could face criminal liability for the video.\n\nRelated article Paul Gosar has a lonnnnnng history of controversy\n\n\"I think threatening the lives of anyone, not just a member of Congress and certainly the President of the United States, should warrant law enforcement attention,\" Pelosi said.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters on Tuesday that Democrats are not worried about the precedent the action would set if Republicans were to take back the majority next Congress.\n\n\"If precedent was set, it was set in the Greene case,\" Hoyer said, referring to Democrats stripping GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia of her committee assignments following upheaval after her past incendiary comments and apparent support of violence against Democrats surfaced.\n\n\"Setting it twice is not going to make a difference I don't think,\" Hoyer said. \"And I know there's comments that we'll do it to you. I don't know, frankly, of any incident that is analogous on our side of the aisle. In any event, if there were an analogous event action ought to be taken Democratic not.\"\n\nGosar entered his office on Capitol Hill on Wednesday ahead of the vote, but didn't take any questions. He also has not participated in the two committees meeting Wednesday morning that the House plans to vote to strip him of later.\n\nHouse GOP leaders had recommended to their members that they vote against the resolution censuring Gosar and stripping him of his committee assignments, according to leadership aides.\n\nThis was not a formal whip operation, but they used the same tactic they employed when 11 Republicans joined with House Democrats in voting to strip Greene from her committees earlier this year.\n\nKinzinger and Cheney both indicated ahead of the vote their plans to support censuring Gosar.\n\n\"I'll be voting yes on the Gosar censure resolution,\" Kinzinger tweeted earlier in the week.\n\n\"We have to hold Members accountable who incite or glorify violence, who spread and perpetuate dangerous conspiracies. The failure to do so will take us one step closer to this fantasized violence becoming real,\" he said.\n\nCheney said earlier in the week that McCarthy's inaction on Gosar is \"indefensible.\"\n\n\"Our party needs a leader who is going to stand up for what's right and stand up for the truth, and stop trying to play these games,\" Cheney told CNN.\n\nCheney said she would support both censuring Gosar or stripping him of his committee assignments.\n\nThis story and headline has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.\n\nCNN's Morgan Rimmer, Kristin Wilson, Melanie Zanona, Manu Raju, Alex Rogers, Lauren Fox and Daniella Diaz contributed.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Gosar becomes third House GOP member to back effort to oust Johnson from speakership\n\nFollow:\n\nRep. Paul Gosar on Friday signed on to the effort to remove Speaker Mike Johnson from his job , the Arizona Republican announced in a news release, becoming the third member to do so.\n\nGosar huddled on the House floor earlier in the day with GOP Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie, the other two co-sponsors of the motion to vacate the speakership.\n\nThey have not taken steps to force a floor vote on the resolution. The House adjourned for the rest of the day on Friday afternoon, meaning the earliest Greene could move to oust Johnson is Saturday.\n\nIf Greene takes that consequential step, the House will have to consider it within two legislative days. This means leadership could wait to handle it on the floor after the weeklong recess if they so choose. A floor vote to oust Johnson would require a majority to succeed.\n\nConservative lawmakers, who are unhappy with the speaker over his proposed foreign aid bills among other priorities, have attacked the speaker for relying on Democrats to advance the bills.\n\nRep. Chip Roy, a key hardliner who sits on the House Rules Committee, accused Johnson of giving away Republicans' leverage on border security. However, he would not say if he would support ousting the speaker.\n\n\"I'm not getting into that right now,\" he said, but when pressed on whether moving to oust the speaker would hurt the House GOP conference, he replied, \"I mean, it's bad for our party not to lead,\" and lamented the GOP's inaction on border security.\n\nOther GOP hardliners were also seething on Friday.\n\n\"It's tough to defend him right now. You know, and that's hard to say, but it's just a reality,\" said Rep. Eli Crane.\n\nThe Arizona Republican, who voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall, didn't rule out supporting efforts to remove Johnson.\n\n\"My position is that I'm open, and I'm not going to tell you guys what I'm going to do. We'll see if that materializes, we'll see if the trigger is pulled on this. That won't be up to me, but I'm definitely frustrated like a lot of the conference and like a lot of the American people,\" he said.\n\n\"He knows how frustrated I am. I do it as respectfully as I can, but I'm not going to pull punches because at the end of the day this is so much bigger than me or the motion to vacate or Speaker Mike Johnson,\" Crane added. \"To me, this comes down to, 'Are we going to try to save this country, or are we just going to continue on with the Washington uniparty that continuously sells out the American people?'\"\n\nRep. Dan Bishop targeted his ire at the House GOP Conference's leadership as a whole, calling their actions \"pathetic.\"\n\n\"My purpose is not really criticism of the speaker, per se, it's the whole - it's the power sources within the Republican Conference and the way - and the speaker, unfortunately, has acceded to it - but it's the way that they never prioritize center-right Americans' priorities. Never. And that's where we've ended up again, and I think it's pathetic,\" he said.\n\nBishop was clear that he is not supporting removing Johnson from the speakership - for now. \"I don't see any particular advantage in solving the problem I just described by moving against the speaker at this time,\" said the North Carolina Republican.\n\nGosar's move comes as Johnson has faced growing threats to his speakership for his handling of legislation to send foreign aid to Ukraine and Israel.\n\nThat threat reached its highest point yet on Thursday after CNN and other outlets reported that Johnson was being lobbied by his members to raise the threshold required to trigger the procedure to oust the speaker - a move that would help ensure the Louisiana Republican can pass foreign aid bills and still keep his job without needing to rely on Democrats to bail him out.\n\nThe speaker was surrounded on the House floor on Thursday by a number of far-right lawmakers in a heated discussion. The group implored Johnson to give them assurances that he would not raise the threshold on the motion to vacate, but the speaker would not commit, leaving many of the lawmakers fuming and some even saying this was a red line that could propel the motion to oust him forward.\n\nAfter that pressure, Johnson said later in the day that he will not change the procedure for removing him from the speakership.\n\nProminent conservative lawmakers echoed Bishop in refusing to back removing Johnson from the speakership until at least the election in November.\n\nHouse Freedom Caucus Chairman Bob Good told CNN's Manu Raju that Johnson \"has failed us,\" and sharply criticized his handling of the foreign aid bills, though he added that he is opposed to ousting Johnson ahead of November.\n\n\"I don't defend the performance of the speaker, I don't defend the actions that have been taken, including today, I think this is a terrible mistake. However, that doesn't mean that I support what I would consider to be not the most prudent action right now. We're 6 months before an election, we've got a two or three vote margin. There's a far greater degree of uncertainty in that situation than there was back in September,\" he said.\n\nRep. Ralph Norman, another Republican hardliner, agreed that they should leave Johnson in place through the election, and said he hopes Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene holds off on her effort to oust the speaker.\n\n\"We've got seven months until an election. We'll have a new president, hopefully, and then we'll see how the speaker race comes out. And to be honest, I don't know if Mike, after all this - he's going through a lot, he's doing in his mind what he thinks is best. I will not criticize them. I disagree with him, I'm not going to criticize him,\" said Norman.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments and reporting.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

      "website": "https://www.cnn.com",
      "text": "Paul Gosar spends most in House on taxpayer-funded travel even as he rails against 'bloated' government\n\nRep. Paul Gosar boasts he's been \"relentless\" in seeking to restore fiscal responsibility and \"common sense\" when it comes to the \"bloated\" federal government.\n\n\"I will continue to cut wasteful federal spending wherever I can,\" the Arizona Republican says on his official website. \"The American people and taxpayers deserve nothing less.\"\n\nYet Gosar doesn't seem to practice what he preaches.\n\nA review conducted by the nonpartisan watchdog Moonlight Foundation of the self-described fiscal conservative's spending shows he has spent more taxpayer dollars on travel than any other member of the House over the past five years - an unusual amount of money spent by a rank-and-file member who has served in the minority for part of that time and has built a scant record of legislative accomplishments.\n\nThe analysis of his spending, reviewed by CNN, raises serious questions about the nature of the expenses since congressional rules do not require lawmakers to disclose anything more than the most basic of details: The amount, the date and the expense's category. Gosar's office denies misusing taxpayer dollars.\n\nSince 2016, Gosar has spent nearly $1 million in taxpayer dollars on travel - the most in the entire 435-member House - as he has traveled to events in Florida, Colorado, Texas and Europe, among other places, according to congressional records. Members in neighboring Arizona districts that are roughly the same size spent about 40% of that amount in that timeframe, the records show.\n\nAnd the closest spenders to Gosar were the two delegates from Guam who served over the past five years - and whose district is nearly 8,000 miles away from Washington or about four times the distance from the Capitol to Phoenix. Yet they still managed to incur roughly $65,000 less than Gosar in their travel expenses paid for by US taxpayers over the past five years.\n\nHouse ethics rules say lawmakers could be held \"personally liable\" for misusing funds and that their taxpayer-funded allowance may \"not be used to pay for any expenses to activities or events that are primarily social in nature, personal expenses, campaign or political expenses or House committee expenses.\" Lawmakers and political candidates are required to use their campaign money - raised from donors or their personal funds - to pay for their political travel.\n\nYet an examination of Gosar's expenses shows that his campaign finance expenses for travel over the past five years pale in comparison to what he has billed taxpayers.\n\n\"No one has spent more taxpayer money on travel in the last five years than Representative Paul Gosar,\" said Karen Goll, executive director of the Moonlight Foundation. \"After he won his second congressional race, his office's travel budget started to skyrocket with budget-busting charges on lodging, car rentals, and transportation.\"\n\nIn a statement, a Gosar spokesperson said taxpayer dollars were spent appropriately and that the higher spending had to do with his role as the chairman of the House's Western Caucus from 2016-2020. The role, the spokesperson said, requires \"extensive official government travel throughout the state of Arizona and the rest of the country,\" including travel costs for the congressman and four aides. The spokesperson said that they use \"one travel purchase card\" for all travel expenses, such as airfare, parking, rental cars and gas.\n\n\"Unlike out-of-touch politicians, Congressman Gosar travels back to his district in Arizona every week, then hits the road, to work tirelessly on behalf of his constituents of the Fourth Congressional District, a district roughly 160 times larger than the size of Guam,\" said the spokesperson, who asked not to be named.\n\nThe House's Western Caucus holds some events and field visits annually outside Washington. In 2021, it was scheduled to hold just a handful of events requiring travel, according to its agenda. And when Gosar was chairman, he tweeted about some out-of-town events he attended.\n\nThere are dozens of caucuses for House members to join allowing them to showcase their shared interest in various parochial issues - everything from the Wild Salmon Caucus to the 5G Caucus to the Motorcycle Caucus. But these caucuses rarely have much sway in the legislative process, and members often tout their membership with such groups simply to demonstrate their involvement on certain issues with their constituents.\n\nWhen traveling for official business by car, lawmakers and staff can seek mileage reimbursements. In the final quarter of 2021, for instance, three Gosar aides totaled less than $400 in mileage reimbursements, while Gosar did not disclose any for himself, according to congressional records. Yet at the same time, Gosar's office disclosed a total of $80,641 in the last quarter for travel expenses for 2021 - nearly half of the $188,099 he incurred for the entire year, the records show.\n\nIt's impossible to know how lawmakers spend their annual allowance because of the rules they set up themselves. Lawmakers' expenses are largely shielded from the public since they can simply file an expense under a general category, such as \"airfare commercial transportation\" without any other information. Moreover, disbursements are released quarterly with no fanfare, and the line-item expenses are cumbersome to scour and difficult to find online and to aggregate.\n\nOver the last few years, Gosar made political trips that generated some attention - at the same time as taxpayer-funded travel expenses appeared in his quarterly reports.\n\nIn February 2021, for instance, Gosar expensed nearly $3,500 over the same time period where he and his chief of staff Tom Van Flein went to Orlando to attend the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual gathering of conservative activists. While in Orlando, Gosar spoke at the America First Political Action Conference, a gathering known for its white nationalist rhetoric. Records filed with the House show Gosar also billed taxpayers another $1,000 in several lodging expenses over three nights in that time period.\n\nOver a three-day period in July 2018, Gosar disclosed to the House Ethics Committee that a group, Middle East Forum, was paying $9,500 for his travel to London to speak at a rally for a jailed far-right activist who had been criticized for espousing hateful and anti-Islamic rhetoric. That same trip, Gosar dined with a far-right Belgian politician with a history of making racist remarks - Filip DeWinter - for an hours-long dinner in London.\n\nYet, in that same time period, Gosar's office charged taxpayers another $2,300 in commercial travel expenses - and there were no corresponding campaign finance expenses in that same period.\n\nThere are also many unknown disbursements that raise other questions as well, such as when Gosar billed taxpayers $11,143 in three different expenses for lodging over a three-day period in October 2021 - with no other explanation.\n\nAt times, even when some of Gosar's travel expenses seem to be for official reasons, the expenses don't seem to justify the need.\n\nFor instance, when Gosar attended a two-day July 2019 event hosted by the Western Conservative Summit in Denver, he expensed $3,430 between commercial transportation, lodging, car rental and meals - a hefty expenditure for a two-day event. Similarly, in March 2019, Gosar joined a House Western Caucus roundtable to talk about energy issues in Houston but disbursements from that time period show nearly $5,500 in lodging and travel expenses even though the event appears to have been for 1-2 days.\n\nGosar's office did not weigh in on each of these expenses when asked specifically about them. But the spokesperson contended all disbursements were related to official activity.\n\n\"Travel receipts are reviewed in-house and by the House of Representatives,\" the spokesperson said. \"In compliance with all travel rules set forth within the travel guidelines established by the House Committee on Ethics and House Administration, all travel was directly related to officially-connected purposes and at no time were official funds used for unapproved or international travel.\"\n\nA dentist from Flagstaff who was elected in the 2010 Tea Party wave, the 63-year-old Gosar has built a national profile as a hard-right Republican. An anti-immigration hardliner, Gosar became a staunch ally of then-President Donald Trump and worked with a group of House conservatives and the White House to try to overturn Joe Biden's electoral victory.\n\nAfter the January 6 riot, Gosar was unapologetic - and contended that the Capitol rioter, Ashli Babbitt, was \"executed\" by a U.S. Capitol Police officer when she was shot and killed while she and a group of rioters were trying to break in through a glass door just steps from the House floor where lawmakers were hiding. A Capitol Police review of the officer's actions found that he acted accordingly and may have saved the lives of staff members and lawmakers as the mob was trying to break into the House chamber.\n\nGosar added to his penchant for controversy last year when he tweeted an animated video showing him killing Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and committing violence against Biden, something he contended was a parody for the battle over immigration while also saying he wasn't aware of the violence in the video before he tweeted it. As a result, Gosar was subjected to a rare censure by the House last November - the first member to endure such a rebuke in nearly 11 years - and then was booted from his two committee assignments.\n\nAnd this year, as Russia's war in Ukraine rages on, Gosar has been among the handful of House Republicans who have voted against bills aimed at showing support for Ukraine . Most recently, he was one of just 10 House members to vote against a bill last week aimed at making it easier to lend weapons systems to help Ukraine defend itself.\n\nBut his spending habits have gotten less scrutiny - even as they far exceed his own congressional colleagues. In his first full year in Congress in 2011, Gosar's spending was comparable to most of his colleagues - about $75,000. That year, a fellow Arizonan, Democratic Rep. Raul Grijalva, spent $79,000 in his travel budget, the analysis shows.\n\nBut over the next decade, Gosar's travel expenses nearly doubled Grijalva's, with the Republican's annual expenses exceeding $115,000 - and sometimes well in excess.\n\nIn the last five years, Gosar has also spent nearly $600,000 more than his Republican colleague from Arizona, David Schweikert, on travel expenses over that same timeframe.\n\nAnd in 2021 alone, he spent the most on travel of any member of the House, spending nearly $189,000 in taxpayer funds. By contrast, Rep. Andy Biggs, a fellow conservative who represents a neighboring Arizona district, spent just over $69,000 in taxpayer-funded travel expenses in 2021.\n\nTaxpayer advocates at the Moonlight Foundation say the Gosar case shows - at the very least - the need for more transparency by members of Congress.\n\n\"Far too often, Congressional travel budgets are treated like personal slush funds by lawmakers,\" Goll said. \"While some travel expenses are necessary to serve constituents, ballooning travel budgets show the need for better disclosures. For instance, detail of where, when, and what purpose lawmakers use taxpayer money to travel outside of their districts ought to be disclosed.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar get committee assignments\n\nRepublican Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Paul Gosar of Arizona have been given committee assignments for the new Congress, after being booted from their committees by Democrats and some Republicans for their incendiary remarks, sources told CNN.\n\nThe House GOP Steering Committee on Tuesday agreed to place Greene on the House Homeland Security Committee, which has jurisdiction over the border and will likely play a role in potentially impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas .\n\nAnd Gosar got a seat on the House Committee on Natural Resources, where he previously served.\n\nBoth decisions were made unanimously by the steering panel, sources told CNN, which is stocked with members who are close to and a part of House GOP leadership. The committee rosters will still need to be ratified by the entire House GOP, but typically the conference approves whatever the Steering Committee recommends.\n\nGreene and Gosar were also among several GOP hardliners - which also included Reps. Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania - added to the House Oversight Committee, according to Republican sources.\n\nThe addition of Greene is notable since she had lobbied for that spot and was a prominent defender of Kevin McCarthy's during the speaker's race. Gosar, who like Greene lost committee spots in the last Congress as Democratic retaliation for incendiary remarks, voted against McCarthy but later flipped to him.\n\nMcCarthy has long vowed to put Greene and Gosar back on committees, while he has pledged to kick some House Democrats off of theirs.\n\nPerry also ultimately supported McCarthy after opposing him. Boebert helped McCarthy win by voting \"present.\"\n\nThe addition of the hardliners will give them the ability to shape some of the most aggressive investigations into the Biden administration.\n\nBoth chambers of Congress are out of session for the week, but the Steering Committee is meeting Tuesday to nail down committee assignments for members of the Republican Conference. Capitol Hill observers have been waiting to see which lawmakers will end up on which committees in the new GOP-controlled House, given the role those panels will play in investigating the Biden administration.\n\nRep. Roger Williams, a Texas Republican who is chairing the Small Business Committee, told CNN that embattled freshman Rep. George Santos of New York will be named to his panel . Santos has faced calls for his resignation, including from Republicans , following revelations that he repeatedly lied about his resume and identity .\n\n\"I don't condone what he said, what he's done,\" Williams told CNN. \"I don't think anybody does. But that's not my role. He was elected. He represents a million people.\"\n\nSantos was also awarded a seat on the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, according to multiple GOP sources.\n\nThe House voted in February 2021 to remove Greene from her committee assignments following incendiary and violent past statements including that she repeatedly indicated support for executing prominent Democratic politicians before being elected to Congress.\n\nIn November 2021, the House voted to censure Gosar and remove him from his committees after he posted a photoshopped anime video to social media showing him appearing to kill Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking President Joe Biden.\n\nMcCarthy has repeatedly cited Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell, both of California, and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota of examples of Democratic lawmakers whom he would remove from their committee assignments.

      "text": "Why Paul Gosar thinks he is a winner\n\nWednesday was, on its face, a very bad day for Paul Gosar.\n\nNot only did the Arizona Republican become only the 24th Member of Congress to be censured by the House but he was also stripped of all his committee assignments.\n\nBut, if you think Wednesday was a bad day for Gosar, you don't understand the distorted reward system of the modern Republican party.\n\nChances are that before he posted the photoshopped video in which he is shown killing Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the bulk of the Republican base had never heard of Gosar. (Sure, he popped up from time to time to push conspiracy theories about the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville and the 2020 election, but - by and large - he was a non-entity on the national scene.)\n\nNow look at him. For the base, Gosar is suddenly a hero of free speech and the antidote to Democrats' pursuit of cancel culture and wokeness.\n\nThat sentiment was everywhere in the floor debate over Gosar's censure on Wednesday.\n\n\"House Democrats have broken nearly every rule and standard in order to silence dissidents and pass their radical agenda,\" said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy . Texas Rep. Chip Roy accused Democrats of \"chilling debate\" with the censure motion. \"What scares me most about this is the attack on the freedom of speech from the Left this year,\" said high profile conservative Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio .\n\nTHE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\nGosar picked up on his newfound conservative hero status.\n\n\"If I must join Alexander Hamilton, the first person attempted to be censured by this House, so be it, it is done,\" he said . (The first person actually censured by the House was William Stanbery, a member of Congress from Ohio. His offense? Suggesting that the Speaker of the House had his eye on the presidency.)\n\nIn all of this, Gosar is following a blueprint laid out by Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was stripped of her committee assignments by the Democratic-controlled House in February after a series of incidents regarding the use of intolerant language. In the before time, that would have been a sure sign that Greene wasn't long for Congress. After all, how can you represent the people who elected you best if you aren't even allowed to serve on committees in the House?\n\nThat line of thinking, however, presumes that the goal of a Member of Congress is to, you know get stuff done. That is NOT in fact the goal of Greene and plenty of Republicans elected in the Trump years to the House. Their goal is to be someone - ideally a major figure on the state television of the right (Fox News), which can lead to lucrative books deals, speaklng engagements and maybe a plum lobbying job when they get out of Congress.\n\nThat new mentality is summed up in an email North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn sent to his Republican House colleagues earlier this year.\n\n\"I have built my staff around comms rather than legislation,\" wrote Cawthorn - meaning that he is spending a lot more time and energy on building a communications operation that will get him known outside of the halls of Congress than he is in putting together a staff that can help him actually do the hard work of legislating.\n\nSeen in this light, serving on committees is a distraction from the real goal that the like of Greene, Cawthorn and Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz have for themselves: Building their #brand.\n\nAnd, judging from the likes of Greene, Republican voters - and donors - have no problem with this approach. Despite being a freshman Member of Congress without committee assignments and a safe Republican seat, Greene has raised more than $6 million so far in 2021 - a once-unheard-of sum for someone of her newness and total lack of power in Washington.\n\nGosar now adds his name to this legion of House Republicans. Which is why the thinks he won on Wednesday.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved. CNN Sans TM & © 2016 Cable News Network."

Paul Gosar complained that there are too few white people enlisting in the US Army in a funding email seen by Vice News.\n\n\"The number of white recruits has plummeted,\" Gosar wrote in the email, which had the subject line, \"dismantling woke marxist ideologies.\"\n\nHe complained that the declining rates were \"a casualty of this cultural skirmish that has left our Army beleaguered and besieged by 'woke' ideologies.\"\n\n\"This is not merely a crisis of numbers,\" Gosar said in the email, per Vice. \"It is a crisis of spirit.\"\n\nMarxist doctrines had \"sapped our Army's vitality, leading to dwindling ranks and dispirited hearts,\" Gosar wrote.\n\nGosar, Rep. for Arizona's 9th congressional district. is known for his far-right views and has been accused of having links to White nationalists and Capitol rioters.\n\nThe idea that the military has become too \"woke\" and concerned with liberal values has become a pervasive one among the far-right, due to changes such as the adoption of LGBTQ+ inclusive policies.\n\nFar-right memes have circulated depicting US soldiers with rainbow flags or referencing pronouns, implying they are weaker than their global counterparts, Vice noted.\n\nGosar was apparently responding to a recent report by Military.com which said that there had been a sharp decline in white recruits.\n\nThe report said that there wasn't one clear reason for this demographic change, but said partisan attacks from conservative lawmakers and media framing the military as \"woke\" might have contributed to the problem.\n\nOther factors include an overall recruitment slump and broader trends in the labor market for men, which has seen men in their prime working age increasingly disengaging from employment.\n\nAnother possible factor cited by the outlet is that young white Americans make up about 75% of fatal opioid overdoses each year, of which there were around 80,000 in 2021.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Rep. Paul Gosar posts 'Attack on Titan' anime edit on Twitter that depicts him killing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\n\nArizona Rep. Paul Gosar posted an edited anime scene on Twitter on Sunday evening that depicts him killing New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nThe \"Attack on Titan\" spoof, entitled \"Attack of Immigrants,\" shows an anime character with Gosar's face edited on it killing a giant superimposed with Ocasio-Cortez's face. Gosar shared the video on his official Twitter account, where it had 2.6 million views at press time.\n\nTwitter's rules and policies prohibit users from threatening \"violence against an individual or a group of people,\" as well as the \"glorification of violence.\" While statements that wish harm or make vague threats may not necessarily fall within those boundaries, the platform may enforce them under its abusive behavior or hateful conduct policies. The platform did not respond to a request for comment at press time.\n\nThe full clip, which is 1 minute and 32 seconds long, splices footage of Gosar, immigration officials, migrants, and former President Donald Trump with clips from the anime. Gosar, a Republican, has been a vocal supporter of Trump and has described January 6 Capitol rioters as \"peaceful patriots.\" He falsely stated in an interview with Reuters that he believes voter fraud led to former President Trump losing the 2020 election.\n\nSince the video was posted, members of congress including Ocasio-Cortez, have responded. California Rep. Ted Lieu said in a tweet that this was \"sick behavior\" from Gosar, writing, \"In any workplace in America, if a coworker made an anime video killing another coworker, that person would be fired.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez quote-tweeted Lieu's response and wrote, \"So while I was en route to Glasgow, a creepy member I work with who fundraises for Neo-Nazi groups shared a fantasy video of him killing me.\"\n\nTagging House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, she wrote that Gosar would \"face no consequences\" for the video because McCarthy \"cheers him on with excuses.\"\n\n\"Attack on Titan\" is a Japanese manga series written by author Hajime Isayama that exploded in popularity when it was adapted into an anime television series in 2013. The story takes place in a world in which a militaristic society, believing itself to be the last vestiges of humanity, lives within the confines of three concentric walls designed to keep out titans, or giant humanoid monsters that eat humans for sport. Gosar's edited video parodies the anime series' first opening theme.\n\nThe series has been criticized in the past for appearing to espouse antisemitic conspiracy theories and its tackling of fascist themes, as Vice reported. Hajime Isayama has also drawn criticism for taking inspiration for a character in the series from an Imperial Japanese general who acted as a cavalry commander in the Sino-Japanese war, Polygon reported.\n\nPolitical interpretations of the series vary, with some saying it condemns fascist and racist ideology. But, as The New Republic reported, some members of the alt-right have embraced the show . In some interpretations that predominately follow a subversive plot twist, they see the show as endorsing white supremacy.\n\nIn the video Gosar shared, his face is superimposed onto the protagonist of the series, who is called Eren Yaeger. In the anime, Yaegar vows to exterminate the titans after they kill his mother and destroy his home.\n\nThe video shows footage of migrants attempting to wade through water is edited with blood splatters on the screen, before showing what appears to be an MS13 gang member, as Newsweek reported . Words like \"drugs,\" \"crime,\" \"poverty,\" \"money,\" \"gangs,\" \"violence,\" and \"trafficking\" appear on-screen. MS13, which is also known as Mara Salvatrucha, was an international crime gang founded by immigrants from El Salvador in California, as the BBC reported .\n\nGosar, as Yaegar, kills Ocasio-Cortez by stabbing her in the neck. In the closing moments of the clip, he approaches a second \"titan\" with his blades drawn. This time, the \"titan\" has current President Joe Biden's face.\n\nOther Republicans, Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert and Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, are also edited into the clip.\n\nRepresentatives for Gosar, Ocasio-Cortez, and Twitter did not immediately respond to Insider's requests for comment.\n\nFor more stories like this, check out coverage from Insider's Digital Culture team here.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "A GOP congressman's tweet about quarantining himself from the 'Wuhan coronavirus' sparks debate about racism surrounding the disease\n\nAfter coming into contact with an individual who tested positive for COVID-19, the disease associated with the coronavirus, at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month, US Rep. Paul Gosar announced on Twitter that he and his staff would self-quarantine.\n\nWhile many praised the Arizona representative - along with and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex) - for taking precautionary measures against the novel virus, others have lambasted Gosar for referring to the coronavirus as the \"Wuhan virus.\"\n\n\"Most people call it the coronavirus. Some call it Covid-19. But only the most ignorant and racist among us would call it the Wuhan virus,\" the CEO and founder of Cool Quit tweeted in response to Gosar's tweet.\n\nGosar's tweet ignited a heated debate about whether the phrase \"Wuhan virus,\" which singles out the Chinese city at the center of the coronavirus outbreak, is inherently racist.\n\nFellow US Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif), MSNBC's Chris Hayes and American journalist Molly Jong-Fast were just two of many who called out the Republican congressman on Twitter for using the term \"Wuhan virus.\"\n\n\"Calling #COVIDー19 the Wuhan Virus is an example of the myopia that allowed it to spread in the US. The virus is not constrained by country or race. Be just as stupid to call it the Milan Virus,\" Lieu quipped on Twitter.\n\nHowever, others quickly defended the Republican representative, pointing out that several media outlets had previously referred to the disease in a similar fashion.\n\n\"Newsflash... There are THOUSANDS of entries of mainstream news outlets including NBC, referring to 'Wuhan Virus,' as well as ASIAN media itself & top medical institutions calling it Wuhan Virus,\" conservative pundit Michelle Malkin tweeted.\n\nIn response to the overwhelming backlash, Gosar doubled down on using the term \"Wuhan virus,\" defiantly using the term repeatedly and claiming his critics were simply \"snowflake Leftists who think everything is racist\" on Twitter .\n\n\"Just astoundingly ignorant to have all major media refer to it as #WuhanVirus for months but somehow, today, you've decided that's #racist . If you think this virus cares about your race you probably work for or watch MSNBC,\" Gosar retorted on Twitter.\n\nGosasr also claimed that people on the left were spreading fake information that COVID-19 was a \"hoax,\" and insinuated that President Donald Trump and his allies had never doubted the \"existence or persistence\" of the novel virus.\n\nIn fact, President Trump called the virus a \"hoax.\" And GOP politicians and conservative pundit Rush Limbaugh, who was recently awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, previously aired a widely-debunked conspiracy theory that the coronavirus was a leaked Chinese biological weapon and erroneously claimed the virus was nothing more than a \"common cold\" being \"weaponized\" against Trump .\n\nAlthough Gosar stood by calling the disease the \"Wuhan virus\" on Twitter, a spokesman for the Arizona congressman told The Washington Post that he did not \"did not have some sinister undertone or meaning.\" In an official statement from Gosar's office on Sunday, the official designation \"COVID-19\" was used instead.\n\nThe debate comes as people of Asian descent have experienced increased discrimination in the wake of the novel virus. As the coronavirus swept across the globe, infecting more than 11,000 people in over 100 countries, racism and xenophobia have spread with the infectious disease . Members of the Asian diaspora have reported more incidents of being racially discriminated and isolated at school, work, and other public places.\n\nIn the early days of the coronavirus outbreak, many media outlets, including Business Insider, referred to the disease as the \"Wuhan coronavirus.\"\n\nHowever, the World Health Organization later designated \"COVID-19\" as the official name for the disease, NPR reported. WHO offered guidelines in 2015 on naming illnesses and recommends avoiding the use of names that refer to specific groups of people, places, or professions to prevent stigmatizing those included in the name.\n\nSince then, Business Insider and other news organizations have taken measures to stop using labels and images when reporting on the coronavirus that could be construed as discriminatory.\n\nHowever, some politicians, including Gosar, have resisted using the new nomenclature for the coronavirus although the virus has spread far outside Wuhan, China. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo ignored pleas from Beijing to stop referring to the disease as the \"Wuhan virus,\" rising tensions between the US and China in the midst of the outbreak, the South China Morning Post reported.\n\nThe Wuhan coronavirus is causing increased reports of racism and xenophobia against Asian people at college, work, and supermarkets\n\nMore than 111,000 people have been infected and nearly 3,900 have died. The US has reported 22 deaths.

Paul Gosar of Arizona tweeted a doctored photo showing former President Barack Obama shaking hands with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.\n\n\"The world is a better place without these guys in power,\" Gosar tweeted.\n\nObama and Rouhani have never met. Rouhani is also still in power.\n\nCNN reported that the original photo that the fake picture was based on shows Obama shaking hands with Manmohan Singh, who was India's prime minister at the time.\n\nObama and Rouhani spoke by phone in September 2013 in a historic moment that reflected the highest level contact between a US president and an Iranian president in 30 years. It came as the Obama administration was in the process of negotiating the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), known as the Iran nuclear deal, with Rouhani's government.\n\nIran signed the deal in 2015, but the pact unraveled when President Donald Trump withdrew the US from it in May 2018. Iran continued to comply with the deal at the urging of other western nations, but it officially pulled out of the agreement over the weekend after Trump ordered a drone strike that assassinated Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the most powerful military official in Iran, who was also widely revered throughout the country.\n\nGosar responded after his tweet made the rounds.\n\n\"To the dim witted reporters like @dmedin11 : no one said this wasn't photoshopped. No one said the president of Iran was dead. No one said Obama met with Rouhani in person,\" he tweeted. \"The tweet says:  'the world is a better place without either of them in power'.\"\n\nGosar added: \"The point remains to all but the dimmest: Obama coddled, appeased, nurtured and protected the worlds No. 1 sponsor of terror. The world is better without Obama as president. The world will be better off without Rouhani.\"\n\nThe congressman made headlines in 2018 after six of his siblings endorsed his opponent, Democratic candidate David Brill, in the midterm elections. In a campaign ad for Brill, Gosar's siblings skewered him for his positions on healthcare and Social Security.\n\n\"I'm just hoping either in this election cycle or next, the people get the idea that he's just not fit for that office and he needs to be removed,\" Gosar's brother David said in the ad.\n\nGosar responded by tweeting: \"My siblings who chose to film ads against me are all liberal Democrats who hate President Trump.\" He also said they were \"disgruntled\" by Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 US presidential election, adding that they were \"related by blood to me but like leftists everywhere, they put political ideology before family. Stalin would be proud.\"\n\nGosar ended by saying, \"To the six angry Democrat Gosars - see you at Mom and Dad's house!\"\n\nJump to"

Paul Gosar told Vice News that the Antifa group - short for anti-fascist - was responsible for the outbreak of violence in Charlottesville.\n\n\"Because let's look at the person that actually started the rally,\" Gosar said. \"It's come to our attention that this is a person from Occupy Wall Street that was an Obama sympathizer.\"\n\nJason Kessler, the leader of \"Unite the Right,\" the group that organized the rally, admitted he did vote for President Barack Obama and had attended an Occupy Wall Street rally, though his views have since become more extremist and racist. The Southern Poverty Law Center outlined Kessler's rightward shift , which began in 2013 after he was angered when a PR executive was publicly excoriated and fired over a racist tweet.\n\nThe rally in Charlottesville, which left a 32-year old woman dead and multiple injured, broke out after white nationalists held a torchlight vigil to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a park in the town, and were met by a large group of counterprotestors.\n\nGosar further suggested that George Soros, a billionaire Democratic donor, had provided financial backing to the Charlottesville rally organizers as some sort of subversive attempt to discredit the white nationalist groups. This theory has been widely debunked.\n\n\"You know, you know George Soros is one of those people that actually helps back these individuals. Who is he? I think he's from Hungary. I think he was Jewish. And I think he turned in his own people to the Nazis,\" Gosar said.\n\n\"Better be careful where we go with those,\" he added.\n\nSoros, who is Jewish and was only 13 years old when Nazi Germany occupied Hungary, has frequently been cast as a scapegoat by conspiracy-minded public figures on the right, including Alex Jones of Infowars.\n\nJump to"

She's no longer alone.\n\nThe Georgia congresswoman is getting back-up on the so-called \"motion to vacate\" she filed against the GOP speaker of the House in March: two more Republicans signed on this week.\n\nThese GOP lawmakers argue Johnson is betraying his party, first by passing compromise government funding bills that were not sufficiently hard-right and now by working with Democrats to pass more aid to Ukraine.\n\nBut the circumstances are far different from October, when then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted via a motion to vacate for the first time in American history.\n\nThat effort, led by Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida and supported by 7 of his colleagues, was only successful because every single House Democrat voted for it. Democrats loathed McCarthy , and the ex-speaker did little to incentivize them to protect him from Gaetz's effort.\n\nThis time, several Democrats have indicated they're willing to protect Johnson - likely by voting to table Greene's motion - if he passes Ukraine aid, as he plans to do on Saturday.\n\nGreene has not yet forced a vote on her resolution, and it's unclear when she will.

An idiosyncratic libertarian who's used to taking lonely positions , Massie is upset with Johnson for numerous reasons, including approving foreign aid and pushing through a bill that re-authorizes government spy powers.\n\nPaul Gosar: The Arizona congressman signed onto Greene's motion Friday to protest Johnson's move to approve more Ukraine aid, saying in a statement: \"We need a Speaker who puts America first rather than bending to the reckless demands of the warmongers, neo-cons and the military-industrial complex.\"\n\nJump to"

Now, some want him removed from office, and they criticize Democratic leadership for not acting more quickly.\n\nTwo of his estranged siblings told NBC News in interviews that the congressman's conduct around the riot should be investigated and that he should face more serious consequences for his ongoing efforts to delegitimize the election results and the attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\"I consider him a traitor to this country.

He told Trump supporters at a December protest at the Arizona Capitol, \"Once we conquer the Hill, Donald Trump is returned to being the president.\"\n\nAt Trump's rally before the riot, Gosar tweeted : \"Biden should concede. I want his concession on my desk tomorrow morning. Don't make me come over there.\"\n\nIn that tweet, he tagged the far-right activist Ali Alexander, who organized the \"Stop the Steal\" movement and with whom Gosar rallied elsewhere in an effort to overturn the election.\n\nWeeks before the riot, Alexander told followers in a since-deleted video on Periscope that he, Gosar, and along with two other members, \"schemed up [the idea] of putting maximum pressure on Congress while they were voting\" on Jan. 6. to \"change the minds of Republicans in that body hearing our loud roar from outside.\"\n\nResponding to a complaint filed with the House Ethics Committee, Gosar said : \"I have never instigated violence,\" adding, \"I have never aided or abetted violence. I have not urged or supported violence.\"\n\nSince the Capitol riot, Gosar has led the defense of those who stormed the Capitol, calling them \" peaceful patriots \" at a May 12 hearing. He has sought to paint Ashli Babbit, the rioter who was shot and killed by Capitol Police after attempting to breach an entrance near the House chamber as members and aides were fleeing, as a victim who was \"executed.\" He added the unnamed officer was \"lying in wait\" for her.\n\nHe joined 20 House Republicans in voting against awarding Congressional Gold Medals to the officers who defend the Capitol against the mob.\n\nSoon after the riot, three of the congressman's siblings, including Dave and Jennifer Gosar, contacted Rep. Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., asking him to help expel their brother from Congress over his role in the happenings. Such a step is exceedingly rare; Congress has only expelled 20 members in its history.\n\nEarlier this year, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., called on the House Ethics Committee to probe Gosar's and two colleagues' involvement in planning Jan. 6 rallies. This month, the committee said in a letter it was declining to investigate.\n\nRep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., in May asked colleagues to co-sign a resolution calling for the censure of Gosar and others. Months prior, Grijalva asked House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to suspend Gosar's committee assignments.\n\nNone of those efforts have gained steam.\n\nGrijalva said Democrats won't be pursuing the kind of reprimand with Gosar as they did when stripping Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., of committee assignments this year, adding such a move would only serve to create more notoriety for the Arizona Republican.\n\n\"Right now, I think Mr. Gosar feels emboldened,\" Grijalva said. \"Nothing has happened. There has been no reaction on the part of his colleagues in Congress, and, basically, he feels no public reaction. So he proceeds along, every time increasing the rhetoric in a bad way. In a very bad way.\"\n\nDave Gosar thinks the only reason his brother has yet to face consequences is because of a lack of political will.\n\n\"They're trying to bury it just like they bury everything in the past,\" he said. \"And I want to tell you if they think that's going to fly this time, they're sorely mistaken. ... I think he should be removed from Congress, and they have the power to do it, no matter what they tell you.\"\n\nJennifer Gosar said she is upset that only Greene has faced formal rebuke after the riot, arguing the freshman member had little to do with the lead-up the rally. Democrats cited other nonriot comments Greene made when she was removed from committees.\n\n\"To say that somehow Marjorie Taylor Greene is like the ringleader makes me want to barf,\" Jennifer Gosar said. \"It's absolutely not true, and it's more because they don't want to take a stronger stance.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers are in no rush to criticize fellow members like Gosar and Greene, but increasingly, they are also putting distance between such members and themselves.\n\n\"The Freedom Caucus has become the Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar caucus, which has diminished its credibility substantially in the House,\" one conservative House member, who declined to be named, said, referring to the group that was once comprised of tea party-aligned lawmakers. \"Many members who used to be associated won't go near Freedom Caucus now.\"\n\nFor Gosar's siblings, they say the rift has caused tension in their family but remaining silent was not an option.\n\n\"I would not have come out publicly if it were not absolutely necessary,\" Jennifer Gosar said. \"But just because he's my brother doesn't mean he gets a pass.\"\n\nAllan Smith is a political reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Paul Gosar over video depicting killing of AOC\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nWASHINGTON - The House voted Wednesday to censure Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., after he posted an animated video that depicted him killing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and attacking President Joe Biden.\n\nThe House voted 223-207, with two Republicans voting in favor - Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and Liz Cheney of Wyoming.\n\nThe resolution also removes Gosar from the two committees he serves on, Oversight and Reform, and Natural Resources.\n\n\"The glorification of the suggestion of the killing of a colleague is completely unacceptable,\" Cheney told reporters Wednesday, \"And I think that it's a clear violation of House rules. I think it's a sad day.\"\n\nFollowing the vote, Gosar had to stand in the well of the House chamber as Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., read the resolution. After expulsion, censure is considered the harshest punishment against a member in the House.\n\n\"When a member uses his or her national platform to encourage violence, tragically, people listen to those words and they may act upon them,\" Pelosi said on the House floor before the vote. \"Words spoken by elected officials weigh a ton. People hear them very differently.\"\n\nShe continued: \"These threats specifically targeted a woman, a woman of color, which is, as the resolution states, a global phenomenon meant to silence women, to discourage them for seeking positions of authority and participating in public life. Again, this is about workplace harassment and violence against women.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez, a member of the Oversight Committee, said Wednesday that Gosar had not apologized to her.\n\n\"What is so hard, what is so hard about saying this is wrong?\" she said. \"This is not about me. This is not about Rep. Gosar. This is about what we are willing to accept. If you believe that this behavior should not be accepted, then vote yes. It's really that simple.\"\n\nDemocratic members could be seen hugging Ocasio-Cortez on the House floor.\n\nGosar spoke a few minutes later, denying that his video was intended to be a threat and saying: \"I do not espouse violence towards anyone. I never have.\" He declined to apologize and then compared himself to Alexander Hamilton.\n\n\"If I must join Alexander Hamilton, the first person attempted to be censured by this House, so be it. It is done,\" he said.\n\nRep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., shot back, \"Mr. Gosar, you are no Alexander Hamilton.\"\n\nIn a statement after the vote, Gosar said the cartoon was done in a \"superhero format with good guys and bad guys.\"\n\n\"It flies through the air. It moves fast. But it does not incite violence. It does not promote violence,\" he said, adding: \"If this cartoon 'incites violence' and needs to be banned and me 'punished' for it, then the Cartoon Network, Disney and all of Hollywood must be shut down and 'punished' for all the cartoon and film violence they portray.\"\n\nRep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., the ranking member of the Rules Committee, said the issue should have been dealt with by the Republican conference or the Ethics Committee. He said Democrats have rushed the process and \"set an extremely dangerous precedent for the future of this institution.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told CNN on Monday that he discussed the video with Gosar before it was taken down, but that was the only response by GOP leadership.\n\nCheney said Tuesday that McCarthy's inaction was \"indefensible, morally and ethically, and it's crazy politically.\"\n\nOn the floor before the vote, McCarthy criticized Democrats for punishing Gosar.\n\n\"It's an old definition of abuse of power: rules for thee, but not for me. That's exactly what's happening here today,\" he said. \"House Democrats are preparing once again to break another precedent of the United States House of Representatives.\"\n\nGosar shared an edited video on his official social media channels last week in which he and other Republican lawmakers are depicted as heroes from the Japanese anime series \"Attack on Titan.\" The faces of Ocasio-Cortez and Biden were superimposed on the show's villains. Twitter later added a warning label to Gosar's tweet, which was eventually removed. The video was also removed from his Instagram account.\n\nThe House has censured about two dozen lawmakers since 1832, most recently Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y., in 2010, over ethics violations.\n\nRebecca Shabad is a politics reporter for NBC News based in Washington.\n\nTeaganne Finn is a political reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Our brother Paul Gosar backed Trump's lie and betrayed America. Has he no shame?\n\nFollow think\n\nMORE FROM NBC\n\n© 2025 NBCNEWS.COM\n\nIn 1954, the Boston lawyer Joseph Welch famously asked Wisconsin Republican Sen. Joseph McCarthy, \"At long last, sir, have you left no sense of decency?\" It was a question that marked the beginning of the end for McCarthy's madness, and the senator died a disgraced and despised opportunist.\n\nWe are not surprised to see him heading down a very similar path to McCarthy's. So, have you no sense of decency, Paul?\n\nWe now ask our brother, Rep. Paul Gosar, that same question. Although his colleagues in Congress and others in the media seem to only recently be paying attention, we have been aware of his unhinged behavior for years. We are therefore not surprised to see him heading down a very similar path to McCarthy's.\n\nSo, have you no sense of decency, Paul? Wasn't it shameful and destructive enough when you:\n\n● Falsely blamed the Charlottesville, Virginia, neo-Nazi march on an innocent, old man in a vicious anti-Semitic attack ?\n\n● Claimed that Covid-19 was overblown and would miraculously disappear after the election, thereby misleading and harming those who believed you, despite the fact that Arizona had the highest infection rate in the world both before and after the November election?\n\n● Marched in England for convicted criminal Tommy Robinson in support of his hateful attacks against British Muslims?\n\n● Backed the Cliven Bundy insurrection , when Bundy used an armed mob to defy officers attempting to enforce laws Bundy had clearly violated for years? (And doubled down on Bundy's bigotry by failing to condemn Bundy's horrible racist rant , although that rant was too much even for Sean Hannity ?)\n\n● Were an open and avowed \"birther\" ?\n\nAnd this is just the start of our list, which includes so many other examples, from your decision to lobby for John McCain's Senate seat while he was still alive to supporting the Senate run of Roy Moore , who was accused of sexual misconduct with teenagers when he was in his 30s. ( Moore has denied the allegations .)\n\nIt seems, in fact, that you are immune to shame. In addition to betraying your family and causing irreparable damage to the relationships within it, you decided to betray your country by helping incite the Jan. 6 domestic terrorist attack on the Capitol .\n\nFor starters, you repeatedly lied about the election results and achieved the deplorable distinction of being the congressman with the most tweets devoted to election lies and instigating the riot. Then you helped organize the \"Stop the Steal\" rallies with Ali Alexander while calling President Joe Biden a \"usurper\" who stole the election and was engaged in a \"coup,\" challenging crowds to \"take the Hill\" and saying \"sedition and treason for stealing votes is appropriate.\" You ended your \"Open Letter to Arizona\" by calling on supporters to \"be ready to defend the Constitution and the White House.\" Finally, you lied on the floor of Congress and falsely claimed that hundreds of thousands of Arizona ballots had been deliberately switched from former President Donald Trump to Biden - a statistic you most certainly knew to be a complete lie.\n\nBut just as shocking, you are now trying to gaslight everyone by claiming Ashli Babbitt was somehow an innocent bystander as she attempted to smash her way into the hallway right outside the chamber where you were hiding, having only moments before lied about the election.\n\nMaybe your lifelong, insecure need for the approval of others caused you to sacrifice your common decency and integrity to satisfy Trump and his followers in order to keep your seat.\n\nIn fact, your lies helped delay the Capitol Police from clearing the chamber, and this delay led at least in part to the officer's decision to shoot Babbitt to protect you. And now you have the gall to blame those men and women who protected you for her death. Disgracefully, you even voted against awarding commendations to those who risked their lives to protect yours? You, one of the key big lie proponents and key instigators of the insurrection? Have you left no sense of decency?\n\nWhich brings us to your white supremacist ally, Nick Fuentes . How is it that a hateful boy 40 years your junior is able to lead you around by your nose? Let's start there. And what about Fuentes' disgusting and appalling Holocaust denial you have never once condemned? Or his racist statements scoffing at the horrors of Jim Crow, segregation and Derek Chauvin's brutal murder of George Floyd - again, statements you have never condemned. What decent person would associate with such a wretched creature? None of your colleagues will go near him.\n\nMaybe you don't know how you got to this very dark place, Paul. Unfortunately, we have some ideas. Maybe it's because you're in way over your head in Congress and don't have the intellect, character or maturity to be in that leadership role. Maybe your lifelong, insecure need for the approval of others caused you to sacrifice your common decency and integrity to satisfy Trump and his followers in order to keep your seat.\n\nThe extremism of your beliefs is finally getting the media attention it deserves. What should happen now is that you resign. Sadly, this seems unlikely. This means unless your colleagues step in, you are likely doomed to go down in history as a cautionary tale: a person who betrayed his family, his country and even himself.\n\nUltimately, the first victim of the big lies - the lies you have always told yourself to justify anything you do, always for your benefit and at the expense of others - is really you.\n\nDave Gosar lives in Wyoming and has practiced law for over 30 years.\n\nJennifer Gosar lives and works in the Pacific Northwest, currently working as a public health official. She is fluent in English and Spanish and still works occasionally as a medical interpreter.\n\nTim Gosar has been a private investigator for about 30 years, working at both the state and federal levels. He is very active in the environmental community advocating for ideas and solutions to combat the climate crisis.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Marjorie Taylor Greene , R-Ga., and Paul Gosar , R-Ariz. - for speaking at a gathering of white nationalists in Florida over the weekend.\n\n\"There's no place in the Republican Party for white supremacists or anti-Semitism,\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in a terse statement.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told reporters for CNN and Punchbowl News that it was \"appalling and wrong\" for the two lawmakers to attend the meeting in Florida and that he plans to discuss the matter with them.\n\n\"There's no place in our party for any of this. ... The party should not be associated any time, any place with somebody who is antisemitic,\" said McCarthy, who recently returned from leading a delegation of House Republicans to Israel. \"This is unacceptable.\"\n\n\"There's no place in the Republican Party for white supremacists or anti-Semitism.\"\n\nSenate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell\n\nMoments later, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., whose own political career nearly ended after it was reported that he had addressed white supremacists in 2002, generally condemned antisemitism and racism but also noted that Greene had distanced herself from the remarks of the event organizer.\n\n\"There's no place in America for antisemitism, for hate speech and thought that any race is purer than any other,\" Scalise told NBC News.\n\n\"It's my understanding Marjorie had condemned the remarks that the leader of that group made, and obviously he made some statements that were racist and antisemitic,\" Scalise said. \"We don't condone those, and we reject it.\"\n\nThe rare criticism of fellow Republican lawmakers by GOP leaders, which followed fierce condemnation of Greene and Gosar from Republicans across the political spectrum, highlighted how the two represent a major political liability for the party as it seeks to win back control of the House and the Senate this fall.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, called Greene and Gosar \"morons\" in an appearance on CNN, while Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said her House colleagues are promoting antisemitism and white supremacy that is \"a toxin in the bloodstream.\"\n\nEven some high-profile Trump allies said they were disgusted. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted that Greene was \"playing footsie\" with \"anti-Semitic neo-Nazis.\" And Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., the head of the conservative Republican Study Committee, also did not mince words.\n\n\"It's unbecoming for a member of Congress to speak at an event that's promoted by anyone who espouses those views,\" Banks told NBC News. \"This is an event that no Republican should attend ... and it's unfortunate that she did.\"\n\nThe firestorm erupted over the weekend when Greene and Gosar spoke at the far-right America First Political Action Conference at a hotel in Orlando, Florida, an event organized by Nicholas Fuentes. Fuentes, a white nationalist activist who gained national prominence after he attended the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as \"brilliant\" in recent days as he ordered his military to invade Ukraine.\n\nGosar attended the Fuentes event last year in person and addressed the gathering over the weekend in a recorded video. Before he introduced Greene in Orlando, Fuentes appeared to offer praise for Adolf Hitler, to whom Democrats have been comparing Putin.\n\n\"Now they're going on about Russia and Vladimir Putin is Hitler - they say that's not a good thing,\" he said. Fuentes then urged the crowd to rally behind Russia in its war with Ukraine; the crowd chanted back: \"Putin! Putin!\"\n\nGreene defended her appearance, telling a CBS News reporter that she knew very little about Fuentes.\n\n\"I do not know Nick Fuentes. I have never heard him speak. I have never seen a video. I do not know what his views are, so I am not aligned with anything that is controversial,\" Greene said.\n\n\"I went to his event ... to address his very large following, because it's a very young following, and it's a generation I'm extremely concerned about.\"\n\nGosar has been silent about the controversy. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nControversy is nothing new for Greene and Gosar. Both were involved in an effort last year to launch an \" America First Caucus \" to protect \"Anglo-Saxon political traditions\"; the idea was dropped after members of both parties panned it.\n\nA year ago this month, all House Democrats - along with 11 Republicans - voted to boot Greene off her two committees after it was revealed that her past Facebook posts espoused antisemitic conspiracy theories and violence against Democratic politicians.\n\nAnd in November, all House Democrats and two Republicans voted to censure Gosar and remove him from his committees after he tweeted an anime video depicting him killing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.\n\nIn the latter two instances, Democrats forced floor votes after McCarthy refused to take disciplinary action against Greene and Gosar. McCarthy has said he would put Gosar and Greene back on their committees if Republicans win the House in the midterm elections.\n\nThe weekend's episode further highlighted the thin tightrope that McCarthy, Scalise and other House GOP leaders are walking as they try to win back the majority in November and position themselves for the top leadership roles in 2023.\n\nA GOP victory in the fall midterms would be likely to catapult McCarthy and Scalise into the speaker's and the majority leader's offices, respectively.\n\nBut to get there, they are taking extreme caution not to anger former President Donald Trump, the de facto leader of the GOP, or his top allies on Capitol Hill, whose support they may need in the future. That's why, for the past year, McCarthy and Scalise have been reluctant to publicly criticize or discipline any rank-and-file members - particularly those in the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus who are closely aligned with Trump, like Greene and Gosar.\n\n\"The No. 1 goal for a handful of people in this town is to become speaker next Congress,\" said a House Republican who requested anonymity to speak about GOP leadership. \"For those individuals, picking fights internally isn't something they are willing to do, because it could interfere with their ability to become speaker.\"\n\nBut the GOP outcry made it clear to Republican leaders that Greene and Gosar had given Democrats a new opportunity to argue why they should remain in control of the House and the Senate.\n\n\"It continues to disturb me that the Republicans in Congress have allowed white supremacists to infiltrate their ranks and that not only do they not repudiate it, they encourage it,\" Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., the former Democratic National Committee chair and the first Jewish woman from Florida elected to Congress, said in an interview.\n\n\"They fan the flames of those who are white supremacists. They don't shun candidates who are running for Congress with their party who embrace white supremacists,\" she said. \"And voters have a choice to make all across the country on whether they want to increase the concentration of white supremacists in the Congress by continuing to elect and re-elect Republicans who embrace that philosophy.\"\n\nScott Wong is a senior congressional reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Paul Gosar of Arizona on committees again after Democrats stripped them of that privilege in 2021, multiple GOP sources said.\n\nThe GOP Steering Committee, which doles out committee gavels and seats, voted to give Greene and Gosar spots on the Oversight and Accountability Committee, which plans to launch numerous investigations into President Joe Biden and his administration .\n\nGosar also secured an assignment on the Natural Resources Committee. Democrats had booted him off both panels in the last Congress.\n\nGreene also won a seat on the Homeland Security Committee, which Republicans will use to focus on border security and to investigate Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Last week, a House Republican from Texas filed articles of impeachment against Mayorkas.\n\nA spokesperson for Greene confirmed her appointments. She had taken fire in recent months from the right for defending Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., during his tumultuous, successful quest to become House speaker, but her gamble appears to have paid off.\n\nGreene and Gosar are allies of former President Donald Trump and members of the House Freedom Caucus.\n\nIn February 2021, the House, then controlled by Democrats, voted to remove Greene from the Budget Committee and the Education and Labor Committee after her social media posts revealed she was spreading dangerous and racist conspiracy theories .\n\nThe Democratic majority chose to pursue a proposal to remove Greene from her committees after House Republican leaders opted not to act against her. Greene, a freshman lawmaker at the time, had come under fire for having expressed support for the QAnon conspiracy theory, embracing calls for violence against top Democrats and suggesting that the Newtown, Connecticut, and Parkland, Florida, school shootings were staged.\n\nLater that year, in November, the House voted to remove Gosar from his two committees - Oversight and Reform and Natural Resources - after he posted an animated video that depicted him killing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and attacking Biden. As part of the measure, Gosar was censured, which is considered the harshest punishment against a member in the House, after expulsion.\n\nAs minority leader, McCarthy had delivered a veiled threat before the vote to remove Gosar, warning Democrats that if Republicans won control of the House in the 2022 election, Democrats' seats on committees might not be safe.\n\nRebecca Shabad is a politics reporter for NBC News based in Washington.\n\nScott Wong is a senior congressional reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. - is a hater in the truest sense of the word. He's effectively declared war on progressive politics of any kind - except when he can use their benefits to earn kudos.\n\nIn a press release Monday, Gosar took credit for airport improvements his district received as a result of the American Rescue Plan, a bill he whined about all the way through its enactment in March.\n\nGosar is just a two-faced politician whose self-serving hypocrisy explains, in part, why his own siblings revile him.\n\n\"I am pleased to announce that the City of Kingman will receive this critical funding for economic relief related to operational costs for cleaning and sanitizing the Kingman Airport to combat the spread of COVID-19,\" Gosar said in his press release. \"This funding is essential to maintaining safe and reliable air service to the community.\"\n\nBut Gosar voted against the relief plan - twice. And in February, as the proposed legislation worked its way through Congress, the far-right lawmaker condemned the package as \"funding for Democrats' pet projects.\"\n\n\"The American people should be furious,\" he had tweeted .\n\nSo should they be \"furious\" or \"pleased,\" Congressman? It's clear Gosar is just a two-faced politician whose self-serving hypocrisy explains, in part, why his own siblings revile him.\n\nRelated posts:\n\nNewsom gives conservatives a taste of their own medicine\n\nWhite nationalists held a buffoonish rally - but there's nothing funny about it\n\nRep.

Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., was censured by the House of Representatives and lost his committee assignments after posting a violent video on social media of a character with his image murdering a character with New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's image. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption\n\nRep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., was censured by the House of Representatives and lost his committee assignments after posting a violent video on social media of a character with his image murdering a character with New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's image.\n\nThe House of Representatives voted to censure hardline Republican Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., and remove him from his two committee assignments.\n\nThe vote was mostly along party lines, 223-207. Two Republicans, Reps. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., and Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., joined all Democrats to censure Gosar, while Rep. David Joyce, R-Ohio, voted present.\n\nThe formal rebuke came after Gosar posted an anime style video on Twitter last week that depicts him murdering Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y, and attacking President Biden. The video, which he deleted after intense blowback, shows a a character with Gosar's image wielding a sword to kill a character with the image of Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nGosar sat in the back corner of the House floor during Wednesday's debate wearing an American flag mask. When it was his turn to speak he defended the video, saying \"no threat was intended\" and did not express any regret for the fallout. He compared himself to Alexander Hamilton, who was the first person Congress attempted to censure, when he served in George Washington's cabinet.\n\nAlso present in the chamber was Ocasio-Cortez, who argued the issue was \"pretty cut and dry\" - if violence was not acceptable in people's homes, in school board meetings, it should not be acceptable in Congress.\n\nUnder the censure resolution adopted by the House, Gosar had to stand in the well of the chamber and listen to the rebuke as it was read aloud. And he will no longer serve on the Natural Resources committee or the Oversight panel - where Ocasio Cortez is also a member.\n\nThe last time the House censured a lawmaker was in 2010 when the ethics committee found Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y., misused official congressional resources and filed inaccurate financial reports and tax returns.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the House needed to act now on Gosar \"because it's an emergency.\" She said it amounted to \"violence against women, workplace harassment, really I think legal matters in terms threatening our member and threatening the president of the United States.\" She added, \"this is outrageous, and outrageous on the part of the Republican leadership not to act upon this.\"\n\nThe No. 2 House Democrat, Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, said the video could qualify as a criminal offense since making threats against federal officials is illegal. During the floor debate Hoyer looked over to the GOP side of the floor and yelled, \"Have you no shame?\"\n\nAnd while some Republicans brought up a host of other issues from inflation to immigration, others condemned violence but countered the Democratic response went too far. Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., said the issue should have been referred to the House ethics committee.\n\nJoyce's present vote was a nod to that option. \"As a former prosecutor and member of the House Ethics Committee, Congressman Joyce has a unique understanding of the Committee's duty to carry out its investigatory and adjudication responsibilities in an impartial manner, \" said Joyce spokesperson Katherine Sears. \"As such, he may deem it appropriate to vote present on legislation related to matters that are or could come before the Committee.\"\n\nCole added he thought the video \"was certainly provocative and in my opinion inappropriate\" but he said setting the precedent of allowing the majority to decide the minority party's committee assignments sets a \"slippery slope for the institution to go down.\"  And he said GOP leaders have a history of policing their members' conduct.\n\nDuring his floor speech, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., argued Democrats were changing the rules of the chamber, and setting a standard they didn't accept for comments from their own members. In a personal swipe, he said, \"The speaker is burning down the House on the way out the door.\"\n\nBut on the floor, Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Pa., referred to the violence that took place in the chamber on Jan. 6. \"This Congress knows what happens when members of the radical right get stirred up by their leaders,\" she said.\n\nOcasio-Cortez told reporters the video is part of a pattern that normalizes violence. She has had a security detail for months following the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and says threats have increased recently. She said the House must respond.\n\n\"I believe this is a part of a concerted strategy and I think it's very important for us to draw a strict line a strong line for material consequence,\" said the New York congresswoman.\n\nIt's not just Democrats who have seen an uptick in threats. Some House Republicans have also faced increase security threats recently.\n\nAfter 13 House GOP members joined Democrats to pass the bipartisan infrastructure bill, another hardline Republican, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., called those members \"traitors\" and posted their office numbers on Twitter. Several of the Republicans reported thousands of angry calls flooding their offices. Both Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., and Rep. Tom Reed, R-N.Y., reported death threats. Police in Nassau County, N.Y., arrested a 64-year-old man for threatening to kill Rep. Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y.\n\nRep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., who also voted for the infrastructure bill, said he made it clear to GOP leaders and his constituents he was backing the bill and hasn't faced any serious blowback from this vote. But he told reporters that after he switched parties in 2019 after being elected as a Democrat he, his wife, daughters and grandchildren faced some death and rape threats.\n\n\"It happens a lot,\" he said, and said he reported it to the FBI and a man was arrested a few months ago.\n\nGreene is pushing for the 13 members to lose their committee positions, and there is a resolution to strip Rep. John Katko, R-N.Y., from his top slot on the House Homeland Security Committee.\n\nVan Drew didn't think that effort would proceed. He declined to single out any of his fellow Republicans when he talked to reporters earlier in the week for the amped up rhetoric. He admitted he had not seen the Gosar video. \"Both parties need to encourage more of a process that is gentle for the lack of a better, not even gentle, even normal and I think in time it will calm down. It's America, it's a good place.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Gosar explained to his GOP colleagues in a closed door meeting that his staff created the video and he had not seen it before it was posted and he took it down later.\n\nBut talking to a conservative outlet Red Voice Media Tuesday afternoon, he defended the video as an outreach effort about the Democrats' agenda. \"It's an anime - we were trying to reach out to newer generations, who like these new cartoons fabricated in Japanese likeness to actually tell them what's harmful in this bill,\" Gosar said, referring to the Democrats' domestic spending bill the House is expected to consider this week.\n\nHe also said he didn't apologize, saying, \"I just said this video had nothing to do with harming anybody.\" Ocasio-Cortez told reporters she hasn't received any apology from Gosar, and complained about the lack of response from top Republican leaders.\n\nLeader McCarthy said Tuesday the video was out of line, adding \"we cannot accept any action of a showing of violence to another member or anything else. That's inappropriate. It cannot stand.\"\n\nThis is the second time a House Republican has faced penalties for over the line political rhetoric. In February the House stripped Greene of her committee assignments for a string of threatening statements she made about Democrats.\n\nRepublican leaders warned then that calling out lawmakers for controversial statements sets a bad precedent.\n\nBut Ocasio-Cortez said if Republicans oppose this resolution it will send the wrong message. \"I think it says that they believe that this behavior is acceptable towards women in workplaces across the country.\"\n\nNPR's Claudia Grisales contributed to this report.\n\nAn earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to Rep. John Katko as a Democrat. He is a Republican.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

SPRUNT: The No. 2 House Democrat, Steny Hoyer, said the censure resolution wasn't about partisanship but accountability for one member threatening the life of a colleague. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STENY HOYER: Can't that appall you, even that act? Do you have no shame? SPRUNT: Many Republican lawmakers did not defend the video but said the resolution goes too far. GOP leader Kevin McCarthy argued Democrats were doing this for political gain. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KEVIN MCCARTHY: For Democrats, this vote isn't about a video. It's about control. That's the one and only thing Democrats are interested in. SPRUNT: But Ocasio-Cortez criticized McCarthy for making it all about politics. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ: What is so hard about saying that this is wrong? SPRUNT: Gosar listened as his colleagues debated his fate. When it was his turn to speak, he defended the video. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PAUL GOSAR: I do not espouse violence towards anyone. I never have. It was not my purpose to make anyone upset. I voluntarily took the cartoon down, not because it was itself a threat but because some thought it was.

      "text": "Rep. Paul Gosar shared an anime video of himself killing AOC. This was her response\n\nBy\n\nRachel Treisman\n\nRep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., is being criticized for tweeting an edited anime video depicting violence against Democrats including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and President Biden. Bill Clark/Pool/AFP via Getty Images hide caption\n\nRep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., is being criticized for tweeting an edited anime video depicting violence against Democrats including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and President Biden.\n\nCritics are slamming Republican Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona for sharing an altered anime video in which he kills Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and swings swords at President Biden.\n\nGosar shared the video from both his personal and professional Twitter accounts Sunday, writing, \"Any anime fans out there?\" in the latter . Twitter has not removed the tweets but instead hid them from view, with users required to click on a label in order to see it.\n\n\"This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules about hateful conduct,\" reads the label. \"However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public's interest for the Tweet to remain accessible.\"\n\nThe 92-second clip appears to be an edited version of the opening credits of the Japanese manga series Attack on Titan .\n\nIt intersperses clips of migrants and Border Patrol agents, images of Democratic leaders and animation of Republican politicians - including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Lauren Boebert of Colorado - on the attack. Blood spatters and words like drugs, crime, murder, poverty, gangs, violence and trafficking flash on the screen at points.\n\nThe Phoenix New Times reports that the plot of Attack on Titan is seen by some as an allegory for immigration and white nationalists' extinction theory and that its anime has faced criticism for antisemitic, pro-fascist and pro-genocidal themes (which the show's creator denies).\n\nIt seems as though the video was done in-house, as Gosar wrote on his personal Twitter that \"the creativity of my team is off the hook.\" His press secretary has not responded to NPR's request for comment but told The Washington Post that \"everyone needs to relax.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez castigated Gosar in a series of tweets on Monday, spanning the personal and the political. She slammed Gosar's video as just one of several incidents of harassment she has faced on the job, arguing that institutions - Congress included - fail to protect women of color.\n\n\"So while I was en route to Glasgow, a creepy member I work with who fundraises for Neo-Nazi groups shared a fantasy video of him killing me,\" she wrote. \"And he'll face no consequences bc [House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy] cheers him on with excuses. Fun Monday! Well, back to work bc institutions don't protect woc.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez recalled other incidents that happened at work and without consequences, such as when Rep. Ted Yoho , R-Fla., called her a \"f****** b****\" on the steps of the Capitol.\n\nShe promised to go back to business, but not before taking one final dig at Gosar:\n\nThis dude is a just a collection of wet toothpicks anyway. White supremacy is for extremely fragile people &sad men like him, whose self concept relies on the myth that he was born superior because deep down he knows he couldn't open a pickle jar or read a whole book by himself\n\nOther Democratic representatives took to Twitter to condemn Gosar's behavior, which California Rep. Ted Lieu called \"sick.\"\n\n\"In any workplace in America, if a coworker made an anime video killing another coworker, that person would be fired,\" he added.\n\n\"These blood thirsty losers are more comfortable with violence than voting. Keep exposing them,\" tweeted Rep. Eric Swalwell , also of California.\n\nGosar, an ally of former President Donald Trump, has repeatedly downplayed the severity of the Capitol insurrection and has spread misinformation about what happened on Jan. 6. Earlier this year, he denounced \"white racism\" after speaking at a far-right conference whose organizer spoke approvingly of the storming of the Capitol and white nationalism, the The Washington Post reported .\n\nAnd Gosar was among the lawmakers whose phone or computer records a House panel investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection asked social media and telecommunications companies to preserve, as those lawmakers were potentially involved with efforts to \"challenge, delay or interfere\" with the certification or otherwise try to overturn the results of the 2020 election, The Associated Press notes .\n\nThis story originally appeared in the Morning Edition live blog .\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "< Rep. Gosar is censured over an anime video depicting him killing AOC\n\nNOEL KING, HOST: The House of Representatives will vote today to censure Republican Congressman Paul Gosar of Arizona. He posted an anime-style video on social media that depicted him murdering a Democratic colleague and attacking President Biden. Here's NPR's Deirdre Walsh. DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: In the anime-style video that Gosar posted on Twitter last week, a character with his image wields a sword to kill a character with the image of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The Democratic congresswoman says the video is part of a pattern that normalizes violence. She says the House must respond. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ: I believe this is part of a concerted strategy. And I think it's very important for us to draw a very strict line and strong line of material consequence. WALSH: The No. 2 House Democrat told reporters the video could qualify as a criminal offense since making threats against federal officials is illegal. Gosar told his GOP colleagues his staff created the video and he had not seen it before it was posted, and he took it down. Talking to a conservative outlet hours later, he defended the video as an outreach effort about the Democrats' agenda. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PAUL GOSAR: It's an anime. We were trying to reach out to the newer generation that likes these cartoons fabricated in Japanese likeness to actually tell them what's harmful in this bill. WALSH: He also said he didn't apologize. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GOSAR: I just said this video had nothing to do with harming anybody. WALSH: Asked by reporters, the top House Republican, Kevin McCarthy, said the video was out of line. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KEVIN MCCARTHY: Cannot accept any action of a - showing of a violence to another member or anything... WALSH: This is the second time a House Republican faces penalties for over-the-line political rhetoric. In February, the House stripped Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of her committee assignments for a string of threatening statements she made about Democrats. Republican leaders warned then that calling out lawmakers for controversial statements sets a bad precedent. Ocasio-Cortez says if Republicans oppose this resolution, it will send the wrong message. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) OCASIO-CORTEZ: I think it says that they believe that this behavior is acceptable towards women in workplaces across the country. WALSH: If the House approves the resolution, Gosar will have to stand in the well of the chamber and listen to the rebuke as it is read aloud. He'll also no longer serve on the Natural Resources Committee or Oversight Panel, where Ocasio-Cortez is a member. Deirdre Walsh, NPR News, the Capitol. Copyright © 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

      "text": "GOP Rep. Paul Gosar Outlines Opposition To DACA Program\n\nNPR's Ari Shapiro speaks with Republican Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona about why he is against the DACA program. He wrote an op-ed in USA Today urging Congress to \"restore the rule of law in the United States by rolling back DACA.\"\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Earlier this week, we spoke with Congressman Carlos Curbelo, a Florida Republican who has introduced a bill to let DREAMers stay here legally. Well, Republican Congressman Paul Gosar of Arizona would vote against that bill. I asked him why he thought people who were brought to the U.S. as children should face consequences for their parents' actions. PAUL GOSAR: Do we allow the children as citizens to move forward and then allow them to claim their families who are the lawbreakers? Something's wrong with this process, and we got it backwards. There are other ways to remedy this. In the '30s, '40s and '50s, we had an extended visitor status that we did every year, allowing people. So no one's saying that you have to be deported right away. But what ends up happening - how about getting back to the rule of law, you know? I think Justice Brandeis said it very, very well. In a government of laws, the existence of the government will be imperiled if it fails to observe the law scrupulously. If the government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for the law. SHAPIRO: President Trump said yesterday that if Congress does not legalize DACA, quote, \"I will revisit this issue.\" How do you interpret that? GOSAR: Well, maybe what he's going to do because he's aware of where I, you know, proposed the long-term extensions for visitor status, you know, on a year-to-year basis - so there's other opportunities on the floor and - that are out there. There's remedies while we go through this aspect of a very articulated, well-predicated discussion about immigration. If you put them all together in one, it'll never pass. But what the American people want is the trust to be restored. Trust is a series of promises kept. Start simple. Articulate with them what it takes to be legally in this country. Look at the definitions of the borders of this country and defining sovereignty of a country that enforces its laws, can create its laws, defines its jurisdiction and upholds those aspects. We have to have all these kind of conversations, and they're begging for it. If they're - if the last election isn't a wakeup call, I don't know what is. SHAPIRO: Historically, Republican leadership has been reluctant to bring a vote to the floor if a bill would pass with a minority of Republicans and a majority of Democrats. Do you think they would make an exception for this bill? I know you would not support their making an exception for this bill, but I wonder whether you think they would. GOSAR: Well, Ari, you know, if anything in the past - you know, those four - my four terms - we see it all the time when we see debt ceilings, when we see budgets, when we see continuing resolutions. Leadership always goes off the - off-course because very few, you know - they can get very, very few Republicans who aren't concerned about accountability and fiscal responsibilities to go along with them. So that's been the fallacy all along - is that leadership does it when they like to and don't use it when it's convenient for them not to. So from that standpoint, you know - if they're going to bring that forward, I'm sure they could probably do that. But there are consequences. And I - once again, I'll bring it up. The American people are frustrated when you don't have a solution, when you kick the can down, when you do a knee-jerk reaction instead of solving the problem. Listen. Make a diagnosis. Break it up into pieces where they can actually articulate a decision and have a conversation with you. And let it go. SHAPIRO: You've described what you would like to see. Given the Congress you know that you're a part of, what do you think will happen? GOSAR: I think this is the perfect storm because we're talking about budgets. We're talking about debt ceilings. We're talking about health care. These are all attractive interplays for all citizens and refugees and immigrants. So why not take it one piece at a time and have that discussion? We can show the American people that we can walk and chew gum at the same time. There shouldn't be a hard lift. SHAPIRO: You're saying wrap immigration into... GOSAR: As piece by piece... SHAPIRO: ...Something like that. GOSAR: As piece by piece by having that discussion. There's plenty of opportunity to have that discussion. There's plenty of time to have this done in a conscientious fashion in six months. So from that standpoint, I don't give the remedy that this is too short a time. It's just perfect to kind of nudge us. And the American public is watching. They want to see that their voices are being heard. They're scared. They don't know who their neighbor is. They want to know that they're following the law. They want to make sure that we're a country, that we're - define borders and that we actually have a rule of law and that we're enforcing it. SHAPIRO: Republican Congressman Paul Gosar of Arizona, thanks for coming into the studio. GOSAR: Ari, thanks for having me - appreciate it. Copyright © 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

There are other ways to remedy this. In the '30s, '40s and '50s, we had an extended visitor status that we did every year, allowing people. So no one's saying that you have to be deported right away. But what ends up happening - how about getting back to the rule of law, you know? I think Justice Brandeis said it very, very well. In a government of laws, the existence of the government will be imperiled if it fails to observe the law scrupulously. If the government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for the law. SHAPIRO: President Trump said yesterday that if Congress does not legalize DACA, quote, \"I will revisit this issue.\" How do you interpret that? GOSAR: Well, maybe what he's going to do because he's aware of where I, you know, proposed the long-term extensions for visitor status, you know, on a year-to-year basis - so there's other opportunities on the floor and - that are out there. There's remedies while we go through this aspect of a very articulated, well-predicated discussion about immigration. If you put them all together in one, it'll never pass. But what the American people want is the trust to be restored. Trust is a series of promises kept. Start simple. Articulate with them what it takes to be legally in this country. Look at the definitions of the borders of this country and defining sovereignty of a country that enforces its laws, can create its laws, defines its jurisdiction and upholds those aspects. We have to have all these kind of conversations, and they're begging for it. If they're - if the last election isn't a wakeup call, I don't know what is. SHAPIRO: Historically, Republican leadership has been reluctant to bring a vote to the floor if a bill would pass with a minority of Republicans and a majority of Democrats. Do you think they would make an exception for this bill? I know you would not support their making an exception for this bill, but I wonder whether you think they would. GOSAR: Well, Ari, you know, if anything in the past - you know, those four - my four terms - we see it all the time when we see debt ceilings, when we see budgets, when we see continuing resolutions. Leadership always goes off the - off-course because very few, you know - they can get very, very few Republicans who aren't concerned about accountability and fiscal responsibilities to go along with them. So that's been the fallacy all along - is that leadership does it when they like to and don't use it when it's convenient for them not to. So from that standpoint, you know - if they're going to bring that forward, I'm sure they could probably do that. But there are consequences. And I - once again, I'll bring it up. The American people are frustrated when you don't have a solution, when you kick the can down, when you do a knee-jerk reaction instead of solving the problem. Listen. Make a diagnosis. Break it up into pieces where they can actually articulate a decision and have a conversation with you. And let it go. SHAPIRO: You've described what you would like to see. Given the Congress you know that you're a part of, what do you think will happen? GOSAR: I think this is the perfect storm because we're talking about budgets. We're talking about debt ceilings. We're talking about health care. These are all attractive interplays for all citizens and refugees and immigrants. So why not take it one piece at a time and have that discussion? We can show the American people that we can walk and chew gum at the same time. There shouldn't be a hard lift. SHAPIRO: You're saying wrap immigration into... GOSAR: As piece by piece... SHAPIRO: ...Something like that. GOSAR: As piece by piece by having that discussion. There's plenty of opportunity to have that discussion. There's plenty of time to have this done in a conscientious fashion in six months. So from that standpoint, I don't give the remedy that this is too short a time. It's just perfect to kind of nudge us. And the American public is watching. They want to see that their voices are being heard. They're scared. They don't know who their neighbor is. They want to know that they're following the law. They want to make sure that we're a country, that we're - define borders and that we actually have a rule of law and that we're enforcing it. SHAPIRO: Republican Congressman Paul Gosar of Arizona, thanks for coming into the studio. GOSAR: Ari, thanks for having me - appreciate it. Copyright © 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

We have to have all these kind of conversations, and they're begging for it. If they're - if the last election isn't a wakeup call, I don't know what is. SHAPIRO: Historically, Republican leadership has been reluctant to bring a vote to the floor if a bill would pass with a minority of Republicans and a majority of Democrats. Do you think they would make an exception for this bill? I know you would not support their making an exception for this bill, but I wonder whether you think they would. GOSAR: Well, Ari, you know, if anything in the past - you know, those four - my four terms - we see it all the time when we see debt ceilings, when we see budgets, when we see continuing resolutions. Leadership always goes off the - off-course because very few, you know - they can get very, very few Republicans who aren't concerned about accountability and fiscal responsibilities to go along with them. So that's been the fallacy all along - is that leadership does it when they like to and don't use it when it's convenient for them not to. So from that standpoint, you know - if they're going to bring that forward, I'm sure they could probably do that. But there are consequences. And I - once again, I'll bring it up. The American people are frustrated when you don't have a solution, when you kick the can down, when you do a knee-jerk reaction instead of solving the problem. Listen. Make a diagnosis. Break it up into pieces where they can actually articulate a decision and have a conversation with you. And let it go. SHAPIRO: You've described what you would like to see. Given the Congress you know that you're a part of, what do you think will happen? GOSAR: I think this is the perfect storm because we're talking about budgets. We're talking about debt ceilings. We're talking about health care. These are all attractive interplays for all citizens and refugees and immigrants. So why not take it one piece at a time and have that discussion? We can show the American people that we can walk and chew gum at the same time. There shouldn't be a hard lift. SHAPIRO: You're saying wrap immigration into... GOSAR: As piece by piece... SHAPIRO: ...Something like that. GOSAR: As piece by piece by having that discussion. There's plenty of opportunity to have that discussion. There's plenty of time to have this done in a conscientious fashion in six months. So from that standpoint, I don't give the remedy that this is too short a time. It's just perfect to kind of nudge us. And the American public is watching. They want to see that their voices are being heard. They're scared. They don't know who their neighbor is. They want to know that they're following the law. They want to make sure that we're a country, that we're - define borders and that we actually have a rule of law and that we're enforcing it.

We're talking about health care. These are all attractive interplays for all citizens and refugees and immigrants. So why not take it one piece at a time and have that discussion? We can show the American people that we can walk and chew gum at the same time. There shouldn't be a hard lift. SHAPIRO: You're saying wrap immigration into... GOSAR: As piece by piece...

Paul Gosar, seen here on Capitol Hill in June 2023, announced Friday he's joining the move to oust Mike Johnson as House speaker. Drew Angerer/Getty Images hide caption\n\nArizona GOP Rep. Paul Gosar, seen here on Capitol Hill in June 2023, announced Friday he's joining the move to oust Mike Johnson as House speaker.\n\nA third Republican House member has signed onto the effort to remove Mike Johnson as House speaker.\n\n\"We need a Speaker who puts America first rather than bending to the reckless demands of the warmongers, neo-cons and the military industrial complex making billions from a costly and endless war half a world away,\" Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar said in a statement late Friday morning.\n\nGeorgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene filed the motion to vacate resolution nearly a month ago, in part over disputes with the speaker on how he handled a $1.2 trillion appropriations package . Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie co-sponsored that motion earlier this week.\n\nThe trio of Republicans have expressed dismay that Johnson forged ahead with Ukraine aid without securing support for a bill aimed to strengthen security along the U.S.-Southern border.\n\nGosar's announcement came shortly after a House vote to advance foreign aid bills to Ukraine, Taiwan and Israel, which required Democrats' support to offset GOP defections.\n\nWith Gosar signing onto the effort to oust the speaker it means Johnson will likely need votes from Democrats if the resolution comes up for a vote. The GOP majority shrinks to a one-vote margin after Wisconsin GOP Rep. Mike Gallagher's resignation becomes official, which is expected after the House votes on the foreign aid package.\n\nSome Democrats have indicated they would help save Johnson if the motion to vacate comes to the floor.\n\nRep. Bob Good, who chairs the House Freedom Caucus, said that although he disagrees with Johnson, he doesn't think it's in Republicans' interest to remove him as speaker.\n\n\"I don't defend the performance of the speaker, I don't defend the actions that have been taken,\" Good told reporters after the Friday vote. \"However, that doesn't mean that I support what I would consider to be not the most prudent action right now. We're six months before an election, we have a two-three vote margin.\"\n\nSeveral members of the Republican conference had called for a Thursday rule to include changing the threshold to bring a motion to remove the speaker - which currently is just one member.\n\nRep. Mike Lawler, a moderate Republican from a New York swing district, said Thursday the threshold should be changed \"immediately.\"\n\n\"However it needs to get done, it should get done,\" Lawler said. \"If Mike Johnson is removed simply because he put aid to our allies on the floor, No. 1, it'll cause another prolonged amount of chaos. And No. 2, it will make it that much harder for the next speaker to do the right thing at the right time.\"\n\nBut Johnson went on social media Thursday to say the House will \"continue to govern under the existing rules.\"\n\nSince the beginning of the 118th Congress, the House rule allowing a Motion to Vacate from a single member has harmed this office and our House majority. Recently, many members have encouraged me to endorse a new rule to raise this threshold. While I understand the importance of...\n\nHouse Democrats played a key role in helping GOP leaders advance legislation to provide nearly $95 billion in stalled funding for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, teeing up a vote on final passage on Saturday.\n\n\"Even though it's not the perfect legislation, it's not the legislation that we would write if Republicans were in charge of both the House, the Senate, and the White House, this is the best possible product that we can get under these circumstances,\" Johnson said after the vote.\n\nDemocrats also took the extremely rare step of voting to advance the Republican foreign aid bills out of the Rules Committee late Thursday night.\n\nHouse Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar of California, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York and House Minority Whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts speak during a news conference at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday. Kent Nishimura/Getty Images hide caption\n\nHouse Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar of California, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York and House Minority Whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts speak during a news conference at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday.\n\nRepublican Reps. Chip Roy, Thomas Massie and Ralph Norman voted against the rule in committee.\n\nAhead of the vote, Democratic leaders had not committed to supporting the rule, as text was not yet available. But they said they were open to the possibility and they were committed to getting foreign aid passed.\n\n\"We're going to do what's necessary to make sure that the national security bill gets over the finish line,\" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Thursday morning.\n\nMinority support of a majority rule virtually never happens. As a result, Johnson and his predecessor, former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, have seen several rules fail on the floor, largely over objections from the right flank of the party.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "Tea Party Up In Arms Over Ariz. Freshman's Vote\n\nBy\n\nDaniel Kraker\n\nMembers of Congress are back in their home districts during the spring congressional recess. And they're facing critiques from voters. Arizona freshmen Paul Gosar was the only Republican from his state to vote for the budget compromise last week.\n\nROBERT SIEGEL, host: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel. Members of Congress are back home for the spring recess, and some are getting an earful from their constituents. Paul Gosar represents Arizona's sprawling 1st District. He was the only Republican representative from Arizona's delegation to vote for the budget compromise last week. And as Daniel Kraker reports from member station KNAU, that decision upset some of his Tea Party backers. DANIEL KRAKER: Sedona, Arizona, is not your run-of-the-mill American small town. Its towering red rocks lure 4 million tourists every year. And Robin Kelley is not your typical local Tea Party president. Ms. ROBIN KELLEY (President, Sedona Tea Party): I'm a psychic, a clairvoyant, an energy healer, and I take people out on the rocks to help them empower their lives, which is exactly what the Tea Party is about, is empowering each of us as individuals to participate in the government. KRAKER: Kelley organized a town hall Wednesday at the Sedona Elks Lodge for Congressman Paul Gosar. Sedona has a reputation as a liberal, New Age town. But Kelley is a small business owner concerned about government spending. And she wasn't happy with Gosar's vote in favor of the budget compromise. Ms. KELLEY: I tell you, I did not like that vote because we need to cut spending, because we need to cut our deficit. So originally, I hated that decision. KRAKER: Until she heard Gosar explain it. The congressman says a government shutdown would have left the military without the funding it needs, and he's encouraging his constituents to be patient. Representative PAUL GOSAR (Republican, Arizona): And this is paltry, yes. You know, Tea Party folks are upset, but you have to get America back into understanding why you have a fiscal problem. You know, not all of us are on the same page, and so it's a learning curve. Mr. PAT HICKS (Founder, Sedona Tea Party): He didn't convince me the other way, but he did explain how complicated it is. KRAKER: Pat Hicks founded the Sedona Tea Party group. Mr. HICKS: For a while there, I was saying come on, guys. Knock it off. We've got a hundred-billion-dollar promise, and now, it's down to 38 billion. No, it doesn't sound right. And now, listening to Gosar today and beginning to understand how difficult it is to take two steps up and one and a half steps backwards, I'm much more sympathetic to their cause. KRAKER: People at the town hall were much less sympathetic to Gosar's vote in favor of the House budget bill that would significantly transform Medicare. It's a risky vote in a state like Arizona, where retirees known as snowbirds flock to the desert sun and vote in high numbers. Ms. SUSAN COSENTINO: I'm horrified by the plan to turn Medicare into a voucher system. I think it'll just send the seniors into poverty. KRAKER: That's retiree Susan Cosentino. The hundred or so people at the town hall in Sedona were mostly seniors. Another, Anne Leap, also works with retirees. She runs a small business connecting them with services they need to live independently. Ms. ANNE LEAP: Seniors at the lower end are so frightened by all this, and seniors at the upper end, they're just - many of them are just outraged. It's a scary time for us. KRAKER: Democrats are hoping to take advantage of that fright. Paul Gosar is one of 25 Republican congressmen they're targeting with radio ads. (Soundbite of radio ad) Unidentified Man: Did you know Congressman Paul Gosar voted to end Medicare, forcing seniors to pay $12,500 for private health insurance without guaranteed coverage? Tell Gosar to keep his hands off Medicare. KRAKER: For his part, Gosar says if we don't fix Medicare now, it will bankrupt the country. Rep. GOSAR: Kicking the can doesn't work anymore. There is a way that we should be able to hold our promise to our seniors and not put it on the back of our future generations. That's where we need to go. KRAKER: But getting there won't be easy with 10,000 baby boomers turning 65 every single day. For NPR News, I'm Daniel Kraker. Copyright © 2011 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Members of Congress are back home for the spring recess, and some are getting an earful from their constituents. Paul Gosar represents Arizona's sprawling 1st District. He was the only Republican representative from Arizona's delegation to vote for the budget compromise last week. And as Daniel Kraker reports from member station KNAU, that decision upset some of his Tea Party backers. DANIEL KRAKER: Sedona, Arizona, is not your run-of-the-mill American small town. Its towering red rocks lure 4 million tourists every year. And Robin Kelley is not your typical local Tea Party president. Ms. ROBIN KELLEY (President, Sedona Tea Party): I'm a psychic, a clairvoyant, an energy healer, and I take people out on the rocks to help them empower their lives, which is exactly what the Tea Party is about, is empowering each of us as individuals to participate in the government. KRAKER: Kelley organized a town hall Wednesday at the Sedona Elks Lodge for Congressman Paul Gosar. Sedona has a reputation as a liberal, New Age town. But Kelley is a small business owner concerned about government spending. And she wasn't happy with Gosar's vote in favor of the budget compromise. Ms. KELLEY: I tell you, I did not like that vote because we need to cut spending, because we need to cut our deficit. So originally, I hated that decision. KRAKER: Until she heard Gosar explain it. The congressman says a government shutdown would have left the military without the funding it needs, and he's encouraging his constituents to be patient. Representative PAUL GOSAR (Republican, Arizona): And this is paltry, yes. You know, Tea Party folks are upset, but you have to get America back into understanding why you have a fiscal problem. You know, not all of us are on the same page, and so it's a learning curve. Mr. PAT HICKS (Founder, Sedona Tea Party): He didn't convince me the other way, but he did explain how complicated it is. KRAKER: Pat Hicks founded the Sedona Tea Party group. Mr. HICKS: For a while there, I was saying come on, guys. Knock it off. We've got a hundred-billion-dollar promise, and now, it's down to 38 billion. No, it doesn't sound right. And now, listening to Gosar today and beginning to understand how difficult it is to take two steps up and one and a half steps backwards, I'm much more sympathetic to their cause. KRAKER: People at the town hall were much less sympathetic to Gosar's vote in favor of the House budget bill that would significantly transform Medicare. It's a risky vote in a state like Arizona, where retirees known as snowbirds flock to the desert sun and vote in high numbers. Ms. SUSAN COSENTINO: I'm horrified by the plan to turn Medicare into a voucher system. I think it'll just send the seniors into poverty. KRAKER: That's retiree Susan Cosentino. The hundred or so people at the town hall in Sedona were mostly seniors. Another, Anne Leap, also works with retirees. She runs a small business connecting them with services they need to live independently. Ms. ANNE LEAP: Seniors at the lower end are so frightened by all this, and seniors at the upper end, they're just - many of them are just outraged. It's a scary time for us.

KRAKER: People at the town hall were much less sympathetic to Gosar's vote in favor of the House budget bill that would significantly transform Medicare. It's a risky vote in a state like Arizona, where retirees known as snowbirds flock to the desert sun and vote in high numbers. Ms. SUSAN COSENTINO: I'm horrified by the plan to turn Medicare into a voucher system. I think it'll just send the seniors into poverty. KRAKER: That's retiree Susan Cosentino. The hundred or so people at the town hall in Sedona were mostly seniors. Another, Anne Leap, also works with retirees. She runs a small business connecting them with services they need to live independently. Ms. ANNE LEAP: Seniors at the lower end are so frightened by all this, and seniors at the upper end, they're just - many of them are just outraged. It's a scary time for us. KRAKER: Democrats are hoping to take advantage of that fright. Paul Gosar is one of 25 Republican congressmen they're targeting with radio ads. (Soundbite of radio ad) Unidentified Man: Did you know Congressman Paul Gosar voted to end Medicare, forcing seniors to pay $12,500 for private health insurance without guaranteed coverage? Tell Gosar to keep his hands off Medicare. KRAKER: For his part, Gosar says if we don't fix Medicare now, it will bankrupt the country. Rep. GOSAR: Kicking the can doesn't work anymore. There is a way that we should be able to hold our promise to our seniors and not put it on the back of our future generations. That's where we need to go.

KRAKER: Kelley organized a town hall Wednesday at the Sedona Elks Lodge for Congressman Paul Gosar. Sedona has a reputation as a liberal, New Age town. But Kelley is a small business owner concerned about government spending. And she wasn't happy with Gosar's vote in favor of the budget compromise. Ms. KELLEY: I tell you, I did not like that vote because we need to cut spending, because we need to cut our deficit. So originally, I hated that decision. KRAKER: Until she heard Gosar explain it. The congressman says a government shutdown would have left the military without the funding it needs, and he's encouraging his constituents to be patient. Representative PAUL GOSAR (Republican, Arizona): And this is paltry, yes. You know, Tea Party folks are upset, but you have to get America back into understanding why you have a fiscal problem. You know, not all of us are on the same page, and so it's a learning curve. Mr. PAT HICKS (Founder, Sedona Tea Party): He didn't convince me the other way, but he did explain how complicated it is. KRAKER: Pat Hicks founded the Sedona Tea Party group. Mr. HICKS: For a while there, I was saying come on, guys. Knock it off.

Mr. PAT HICKS (Founder, Sedona Tea Party): He didn't convince me the other way, but he did explain how complicated it is. KRAKER: Pat Hicks founded the Sedona Tea Party group. Mr. HICKS: For a while there, I was saying come on, guys. Knock it off. We've got a hundred-billion-dollar promise, and now, it's down to 38 billion. No, it doesn't sound right. And now, listening to Gosar today and beginning to understand how difficult it is to take two steps up and one and a half steps backwards, I'm much more sympathetic to their cause. KRAKER: People at the town hall were much less sympathetic to Gosar's vote in favor of the House budget bill that would significantly transform Medicare. It's a risky vote in a state like Arizona, where retirees known as snowbirds flock to the desert sun and vote in high numbers. Ms. SUSAN COSENTINO: I'm horrified by the plan to turn Medicare into a voucher system. I think it'll just send the seniors into poverty. KRAKER: That's retiree Susan Cosentino. The hundred or so people at the town hall in Sedona were mostly seniors. Another, Anne Leap, also works with retirees. She runs a small business connecting them with services they need to live independently. Ms. ANNE LEAP: Seniors at the lower end are so frightened by all this, and seniors at the upper end, they're just - many of them are just outraged. It's a scary time for us. KRAKER: Democrats are hoping to take advantage of that fright. Paul Gosar is one of 25 Republican congressmen they're targeting with radio ads. (Soundbite of radio ad) Unidentified Man: Did you know Congressman Paul Gosar voted to end Medicare, forcing seniors to pay $12,500 for private health insurance without guaranteed coverage? Tell Gosar to keep his hands off Medicare. KRAKER: For his part, Gosar says if we don't fix Medicare now, it will bankrupt the country. Rep. GOSAR: Kicking the can doesn't work anymore. There is a way that we should be able to hold our promise to our seniors and not put it on the back of our future generations. That's where we need to go. KRAKER: But getting there won't be easy with 10,000 baby boomers turning 65 every single day. For NPR News, I'm Daniel Kraker. Copyright © 2011 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Paul Gosar Self-Quarantine After Coronavirus Exposure At CPAC\n\nClaudia Grisales\n\nA bottle of hand sanitizer is seen during a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing on Capitol Hill Thursday. Lawmakers are preparing to what to do if coronavirus hits the Capitol. Sarah Silbiger/Bloomberg via Getty Images hide caption\n\nA bottle of hand sanitizer is seen during a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing on Capitol Hill Thursday. Lawmakers are preparing to what to do if coronavirus hits the Capitol.\n\nUpdated at 10:57 p.m. ET\n\nThese are no ordinary times for Congress.\n\nThere are fewer handshakes. Purell hand sanitizer dispensers are posted outside the Senate and House chambers. Staffers are preparing plans to work remotely if there's a sudden closure.\n\nWelcome to a post-coronavirus world for the U.S. Capitol as it weighs developments from the spreading outbreak against its daily operations.\n\n\"The leadership of the Capitol is always concerned about the security of the Capitol,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters Thursday. \"And now it is coming down more in terms of ... health security.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz became the first lawmaker to make the decision to self-quarantine, saying he may have been personally exposed to the virus. Cruz said he would remain at his Texas home for the next week after he briefly interacted with a person who later tested positive for COVID-19 at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February. But Cruz said he had no symptoms and said health officials believe his risk of contracting the virus was low.\n\nLater Sunday, Rep. Paul Gosar said he and three of his senior staff members opted to self-quarantine as a \"proactive and cautious\" measure after recalling his own interactions with the CPAC attendee who had contracted the virus. Gosar said neither he nor his staff members showed symptoms.\n\nEach year, 3 million or more people visit the U.S. Capitol Building, and of those, an estimated 60 percent visit between the months of March and July, according to the Architect of the Capitol, the federal agency that oversees its operations. And as is tradition on weekends and other recess periods, lawmakers regularly travel back and forth to their home districts, including areas now considered hot spots in the growing outbreak.\n\nReviewing policies, making plans\n\nThis past week, Pelosi invited the \"Big Four\" congressional leaders to meet behind closed doors with officials who oversee safety and health at the Capitol. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy took part in the sometimes classified meeting.\n\nAmong the topics, officials addressed personal hygiene and contingency plans for Capitol building staffers to work from home if there's a closure, said Pelosi, D-Calif.\n\nFor now, lawmakers and staff are say there aren't any disruptions to daily operations.\n\n\"We are reviewing policies to protect both the health of those who work here and those who visit here,\" McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters. \"And if we have more announcements to make we'll let you know.\"\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., gives news reporters hand sanitizer following a Senate hearing on the coronavirus on Capitol Hill Tuesday. Tom Brenner/Reuters hide caption\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., gives news reporters hand sanitizer following a Senate hearing on the coronavirus on Capitol Hill Tuesday.\n\nLouisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy is a gastroenterologist and is known for always having hand sanitizer on hand. He's impressed with the supply available for U.S. Capitol visitors. For now, he can't see a closure happening.\n\n\"I would imagine if it ever comes to the nation's capital in a big way, they would do more. But again you have to have a state of graduated effects, right?\" he said. \"So there is going to be an appropriate escalation in response to scientific evidence.\"\n\nLawmakers are attending regular briefings on the state of the coronavirus outbreak. Members and staff are also receiving guidance on precautions to take now and plans to make for later if a coronavirus outbreak reaches Capitol Hill.\n\nLawmakers and staffers said there haven't been any discussions of shutting down public galleries or limiting tours. The focus remains on precautions and keeping Congress open.\n\nMissouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt, who chairs the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, said he's been in touch with key Capitol officials to ensure that's the plan for now.\n\n\"Generally we do the same thing if there's a flu outbreak, which is encourage people to take care of themselves,\" he said. \"If there is some kind of pandemic, we have a plan, but we have no thought that that plan is anywhere in the foreseeable future.\"\n\nMinimize contact\n\nThe advice to members and staff is a familiar tune now: ensure vigorous hand washing, stay home if you are ill, wipe down surfaces and cover coughs or sneezes. But they're also hearing extra emphasis on limiting physical contact with visitors.\n\nLast week, Dr. Brian Monahan, the attending physician for Congress, briefed the Democratic caucus on best health practices, said New York Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nMonahan suggested \"we minimize contact with individuals as feasible. We are still working through the question of transmissibility. To the extent that there are some unknowns, we all have to proceed with caution,\" Jeffries said.\n\nHouse leadership and California Democrat Zoe Rep. Lofgren, who chairs the House Administration Committee, are weighing potential next steps if the illness continues to spread, Jeffries noted.\n\nPelosi said she hopes the message for boosting best health practices reaches visitors to the U.S. Capitol Building. She said screening all visitors' temperatures before they enter is not an option.\n\n\"We are a place where many people come, especially at this time of the year, in the spring,\" Pelosi said. \"So what we want to do is to make sure that our visitors, our press, our staff and our members take the precautions necessary or in their own lives, wherever they do live, but especially when they come to a place like this, where many people come together.\"\n\nBut staff are also preparing for the potential of congressional closures. For example, they're ensuring that technology is up to date if they have to suddenly work from home.\n\n\"God forbid, but in case there is a need,\" Pelosi said. But, she noted, \"we can't vote from home.\"\n\nIt's a key concern, especially after Congress approved an estimated $8 billion emergency funding package to fight the novel coronavirus last week.\n\n\"I think we're going to be developing good habits as we go forward,\" Pelosi said, later adding, \"but we'll be ready should something come along, but ... what we mostly do is pray.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Paul Gosar of Arizona, who along with others is pushing back on the deal.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST: So earlier this morning I spoke to Congressman Paul Gosar. He's a Republican from Arizona. And just so you know, when I spoke with him about all this, NPR was at that point not broadcasting the vulgarity that the president is alleged to have used, and we did not use that word in our conversation. I want to ask you about comments made by your colleague. Republican Congresswoman Mia Love of Utah called on the president to apologize for these comments. She said that they were unkind, divisive, elitist and fly in the face of our nation's values. Do you join her in that condemnation? PAUL GOSAR: I can't condone, you know, vocabulary that one of - another person actually utilizes in that aspect. But I also understand that the president is not a career politician, that, you know, may say things that are not politically correct in the world of politics. MARTIN: So you're saying the term that he used is just - it's just politically incorrect. It's not offensive on its face. GOSAR: It's - I think there's - any word we can use can be utilized in an offensive aspect, Rachel. I think the intent is that when we look at other countries, the lawlessness that is exacerbated by their capacity makes them not something to be wanting to stay. That's why you see such a precipitation of people wanting to come to the United States. So maybe a poor choice of words but, you know, everybody has to acknowledge their comments. MARTIN: Lots of folks are saying this is more than a poor choice of words. No surprise, Democrats are lashing out. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal described the comment as, quote, \"racism masquerading poorly as immigration policy.\" Do you understand the racial element of that term and how he used it? GOSAR: Oh, I do. But I think when you - when we start slinging the racial slurs, you know, I think that's a poor choice on both sides. I think we... MARTIN: Even though he said he would prefer immigrants from Norway, a predominantly white country? GOSAR: You know, looking all the way across the board, you know, for immigrants coming to a country from very different statuses - you know, higher-status living that are presented in Norway versus maybe what you would see in Haiti or in parts of Africa. And that's part of the rule of law. You know, I think that was what his comments were, maybe a very, very poor choice of how to place that. But once again, starting to use the racial slur - I think we've used it way more on both sides. And I think it really clouds the issue of having a very good debate. MARTIN: It is the issue for some people. But I want to move on and ask about the substance of this bill that was brought to the president. Senator Jeff Flake was at the helm of this thing. And it's notable that the president had said earlier - on Tuesday, actually - that he was going to sign anything that congressional members came up with. This is what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: What I approve is going to be very much reliant on what the people in this room come to me with. I have great confidence in the - if they come to me with things that I'm not in love with, I'm going to do it. MARTIN: So why won't the president sign this deal that a bipartisan group brought to him yesterday? GOSAR: Well, first of all, being in the House, I don't always appreciate what the Senate comes up with. So there's that animosity as well. So - but I think the president has been very firm up until that point was - is that a framework for immigration had to have border security, had to have a kibosh to chain migration and other aspects... MARTIN: Which this did. It also just had DACA protections in it to prevent so-called DREAMers from being deported. Do you think that should be included in any immigration bill? GOSAR: Well, I think what we have to do is be very, very careful and that there's no special status that is given until we look at the bigger problem. And that is - why are we taking 700,000 people and moving them to the front of the line in the victim category? Isn't there a bigger category of immigrants that are the victims that are trying to do it the right way that we ought to really concentrate on and make sure that we have the full status in regards to how do we look at our immigration from top to bottom in a fair and equitable way? I think that's the biggest key because the rule of law is key here. MARTIN: All right, we're going to have to leave it there. Congressman Paul Gosar of Arizona, member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, thank you very much for your time this morning. GOSAR: Thanks so much, Rachel. MARTIN: All right. NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow is still in the studio with us. So, Scott, I want to take us back to the beginning of that conversation we just heard with Congressman Gosar. Clearly, Republicans in Congress finding themselves yet again trying to do some cleanup after President Trump says something that they say is just inarticulate. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Sure. Pick a tweet, pick a statement from the campaign and from his presidency - there's dozens to pick from - where Trump says something that many people find incredibly offensive. And you have this dance that many Republicans do - especially in the House, where Trump is deeply popular in many House Republican districts - where they want to distance themselves from the statement, from the tweet, but still support the president. And you heard that again there. DAVID GREENE, HOST: Scott, we, I mean, are spending much of this morning - and we have at different times during this presidency - talking about, like, a tweet or a word. There's policy to talk about, too. I mean, this meeting was at a moment when there has been talk for some time about DACA and immigration being a real place of potential for bipartisan compromise. Where do negotiations stand right now? Is it still heading in that direction despite this moment at the White House? DETROW: Well, after that meeting, Dick Durbin's office said that they still were sticking with the plan of before the meeting. They're trying to sell this agreement that this group of six senators came up with to Congress. It's tough, though, because, well, there's a majority in both Houses who want DACA protectees to stay in this country. Beyond that, it's very hard to reach a compromise that everyone's happy with. A lot of... MARTIN: I mean, we heard this congressman, Gosar, saying that he doesn't want DACA protections. DETROW: Exactly. MARTIN: So at least he has questions. DETROW: And the broader push of wanting to have a big crackdown on illegal immigration and to limit legal immigration is something many Republicans in the House especially want to see. And at the same time, you have Democrats who are resentful of the fact that DACA protectees are part of a broader bargain that would lead to policies they don't like. GREENE: And it's not just immigration. We've been talking about immigration, even infrastructures, things that we might see bipartisan compromise. But you head into a midterm election year where there are a lot of issues where the parties are truly dug in. I mean, there's no guarantee of that. DETROW: That's right. And often it's the activist voices who speak loudest, who influence primaries and who influence the decisions that members in both parties make. And that's one reason why there has not been a broad bipartisan immigration bill to get to a president's desk in decades. GREENE: NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow. Scott, thanks a lot. DETROW: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF LOWER SPECTRUM'S \"NOCTURNAL\") Copyright © 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

They're trying to sell this agreement that this group of six senators came up with to Congress. It's tough, though, because, well, there's a majority in both Houses who want DACA protectees to stay in this country. Beyond that, it's very hard to reach a compromise that everyone's happy with. A lot of... MARTIN: I mean, we heard this congressman, Gosar, saying that he doesn't want DACA protections. DETROW: Exactly. MARTIN: So at least he has questions. DETROW: And the broader push of wanting to have a big crackdown on illegal immigration and to limit legal immigration is something many Republicans in the House especially want to see. And at the same time, you have Democrats who are resentful of the fact that DACA protectees are part of a broader bargain that would lead to policies they don't like. GREENE: And it's not just immigration. We've been talking about immigration, even infrastructures, things that we might see bipartisan compromise. But you head into a midterm election year where there are a lot of issues where the parties are truly dug in. I mean, there's no guarantee of that. DETROW: That's right. And often it's the activist voices who speak loudest, who influence primaries and who influence the decisions that members in both parties make. And that's one reason why there has not been a broad bipartisan immigration bill to get to a president's desk in decades. GREENE: NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow. Scott, thanks a lot. DETROW: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF LOWER SPECTRUM'S \"NOCTURNAL\") Copyright © 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nSo earlier this morning I spoke to Congressman Paul Gosar. He's a Republican from Arizona. And just so you know, when I spoke with him about all this, NPR was at that point not broadcasting the vulgarity that the president is alleged to have used, and we did not use that word in our conversation. I want to ask you about comments made by your colleague. Republican Congresswoman Mia Love of Utah called on the president to apologize for these comments. She said that they were unkind, divisive, elitist and fly in the face of our nation's values. Do you join her in that condemnation? PAUL GOSAR: I can't condone, you know, vocabulary that one of - another person actually utilizes in that aspect. But I also understand that the president is not a career politician, that, you know, may say things that are not politically correct in the world of politics. MARTIN: So you're saying the term that he used is just - it's just politically incorrect. It's not offensive on its face. GOSAR: It's - I think there's - any word we can use can be utilized in an offensive aspect, Rachel. I think the intent is that when we look at other countries, the lawlessness that is exacerbated by their capacity makes them not something to be wanting to stay. That's why you see such a precipitation of people wanting to come to the United States. So maybe a poor choice of words but, you know, everybody has to acknowledge their comments. MARTIN: Lots of folks are saying this is more than a poor choice of words. No surprise, Democrats are lashing out. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal described the comment as, quote, \"racism masquerading poorly as immigration policy.\" Do you understand the racial element of that term and how he used it? GOSAR: Oh, I do. But I think when you - when we start slinging the racial slurs, you know, I think that's a poor choice on both sides. I think we... MARTIN: Even though he said he would prefer immigrants from Norway, a predominantly white country? GOSAR: You know, looking all the way across the board, you know, for immigrants coming to a country from very different statuses - you know, higher-status living that are presented in Norway versus maybe what you would see in Haiti or in parts of Africa. And that's part of the rule of law. You know, I think that was what his comments were, maybe a very, very poor choice of how to place that. But once again, starting to use the racial slur - I think we've used it way more on both sides. And I think it really clouds the issue of having a very good debate. MARTIN: It is the issue for some people. But I want to move on and ask about the substance of this bill that was brought to the president. Senator Jeff Flake was at the helm of this thing. And it's notable that the president had said earlier - on Tuesday, actually - that he was going to sign anything that congressional members came up with. This is what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: What I approve is going to be very much reliant on what the people in this room come to me with. I have great confidence in the - if they come to me with things that I'm not in love with, I'm going to do it. MARTIN: So why won't the president sign this deal that a bipartisan group brought to him yesterday? GOSAR: Well, first of all, being in the House, I don't always appreciate what the Senate comes up with. So there's that animosity as well. So - but I think the president has been very firm up until that point was - is that a framework for immigration had to have border security, had to have a kibosh to chain migration and other aspects... MARTIN: Which this did. It also just had DACA protections in it to prevent so-called DREAMers from being deported. Do you think that should be included in any immigration bill? GOSAR: Well, I think what we have to do is be very, very careful and that there's no special status that is given until we look at the bigger problem. And that is - why are we taking 700,000 people and moving them to the front of the line in the victim category? Isn't there a bigger category of immigrants that are the victims that are trying to do it the right way that we ought to really concentrate on and make sure that we have the full status in regards to how do we look at our immigration from top to bottom in a fair and equitable way? I think that's the biggest key because the rule of law is key here. MARTIN: All right, we're going to have to leave it there. Congressman Paul Gosar of Arizona, member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, thank you very much for your time this morning. GOSAR: Thanks so much, Rachel. MARTIN: All right. NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow is still in the studio with us. So, Scott, I want to take us back to the beginning of that conversation we just heard with Congressman Gosar. Clearly, Republicans in Congress finding themselves yet again trying to do some cleanup after President Trump says something that they say is just inarticulate. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Sure. Pick a tweet, pick a statement from the campaign and from his presidency - there's dozens to pick from - where Trump says something that many people find incredibly offensive. And you have this dance that many Republicans do - especially in the House, where Trump is deeply popular in many House Republican districts - where they want to distance themselves from the statement, from the tweet, but still support the president. And you heard that again there. DAVID GREENE, HOST: Scott, we, I mean, are spending much of this morning - and we have at different times during this presidency - talking about, like, a tweet or a word. There's policy to talk about, too. I mean, this meeting was at a moment when there has been talk for some time about DACA and immigration being a real place of potential for bipartisan compromise. Where do negotiations stand right now? Is it still heading in that direction despite this moment at the White House? DETROW: Well, after that meeting, Dick Durbin's office said that they still were sticking with the plan of before the meeting.

GOSAR: Oh, I do. But I think when you - when we start slinging the racial slurs, you know, I think that's a poor choice on both sides. I think we... MARTIN: Even though he said he would prefer immigrants from Norway, a predominantly white country? GOSAR: You know, looking all the way across the board, you know, for immigrants coming to a country from very different statuses - you know, higher-status living that are presented in Norway versus maybe what you would see in Haiti or in parts of Africa. And that's part of the rule of law. You know, I think that was what his comments were, maybe a very, very poor choice of how to place that. But once again, starting to use the racial slur - I think we've used it way more on both sides. And I think it really clouds the issue of having a very good debate. MARTIN: It is the issue for some people. But I want to move on and ask about the substance of this bill that was brought to the president. Senator Jeff Flake was at the helm of this thing. And it's notable that the president had said earlier - on Tuesday, actually - that he was going to sign anything that congressional members came up with. This is what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: What I approve is going to be very much reliant on what the people in this room come to me with. I have great confidence in the - if they come to me with things that I'm not in love with, I'm going to do it. MARTIN: So why won't the president sign this deal that a bipartisan group brought to him yesterday? GOSAR: Well, first of all, being in the House, I don't always appreciate what the Senate comes up with. So there's that animosity as well. So - but I think the president has been very firm up until that point was - is that a framework for immigration had to have border security, had to have a kibosh to chain migration and other aspects... MARTIN: Which this did. It also just had DACA protections in it to prevent so-called DREAMers from being deported. Do you think that should be included in any immigration bill? GOSAR: Well, I think what we have to do is be very, very careful and that there's no special status that is given until we look at the bigger problem. And that is - why are we taking 700,000 people and moving them to the front of the line in the victim category? Isn't there a bigger category of immigrants that are the victims that are trying to do it the right way that we ought to really concentrate on and make sure that we have the full status in regards to how do we look at our immigration from top to bottom in a fair and equitable way? I think that's the biggest key because the rule of law is key here. MARTIN: All right, we're going to have to leave it there. Congressman Paul Gosar of Arizona, member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, thank you very much for your time this morning. GOSAR: Thanks so much, Rachel. MARTIN: All right. NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow is still in the studio with us. So, Scott, I want to take us back to the beginning of that conversation we just heard with Congressman Gosar. Clearly, Republicans in Congress finding themselves yet again trying to do some cleanup after President Trump says something that they say is just inarticulate. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Sure. Pick a tweet, pick a statement from the campaign and from his presidency - there's dozens to pick from - where Trump says something that many people find incredibly offensive. And you have this dance that many Republicans do - especially in the House, where Trump is deeply popular in many House Republican districts - where they want to distance themselves from the statement, from the tweet, but still support the president. And you heard that again there. DAVID GREENE, HOST: Scott, we, I mean, are spending much of this morning - and we have at different times during this presidency - talking about, like, a tweet or a word. There's policy to talk about, too. I mean, this meeting was at a moment when there has been talk for some time about DACA and immigration being a real place of potential for bipartisan compromise. Where do negotiations stand right now? Is it still heading in that direction despite this moment at the White House? DETROW: Well, after that meeting, Dick Durbin's office said that they still were sticking with the plan of before the meeting. They're trying to sell this agreement that this group of six senators came up with to Congress. It's tough, though, because, well, there's a majority in both Houses who want DACA protectees to stay in this country. Beyond that, it's very hard to reach a compromise that everyone's happy with. A lot of... MARTIN: I mean, we heard this congressman, Gosar, saying that he doesn't want DACA protections. DETROW: Exactly. MARTIN: So at least he has questions. DETROW: And the broader push of wanting to have a big crackdown on illegal immigration and to limit legal immigration is something many Republicans in the House especially want to see. And at the same time, you have Democrats who are resentful of the fact that DACA protectees are part of a broader bargain that would lead to policies they don't like. GREENE: And it's not just immigration. We've been talking about immigration, even infrastructures, things that we might see bipartisan compromise. But you head into a midterm election year where there are a lot of issues where the parties are truly dug in. I mean, there's no guarantee of that. DETROW: That's right. And often it's the activist voices who speak loudest, who influence primaries and who influence the decisions that members in both parties make. And that's one reason why there has not been a broad bipartisan immigration bill to get to a president's desk in decades. GREENE: NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow. Scott, thanks a lot. DETROW: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF LOWER SPECTRUM'S \"NOCTURNAL\") Copyright © 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

But I also understand that the president is not a career politician, that, you know, may say things that are not politically correct in the world of politics. MARTIN: So you're saying the term that he used is just - it's just politically incorrect. It's not offensive on its face. GOSAR: It's - I think there's - any word we can use can be utilized in an offensive aspect, Rachel. I think the intent is that when we look at other countries, the lawlessness that is exacerbated by their capacity makes them not something to be wanting to stay. That's why you see such a precipitation of people wanting to come to the United States. So maybe a poor choice of words but, you know, everybody has to acknowledge their comments.

And that's one reason why there has not been a broad bipartisan immigration bill to get to a president's desk in decades. GREENE: NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow. Scott, thanks a lot. DETROW: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF LOWER SPECTRUM'S \"NOCTURNAL\") Copyright © 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I think the intent is that when we look at other countries, the lawlessness that is exacerbated by their capacity makes them not something to be wanting to stay. That's why you see such a precipitation of people wanting to come to the United States. So maybe a poor choice of words but, you know, everybody has to acknowledge their comments. MARTIN: Lots of folks are saying this is more than a poor choice of words. No surprise, Democrats are lashing out. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal described the comment as, quote, \"racism masquerading poorly as immigration policy.\" Do you understand the racial element of that term and how he used it? GOSAR: Oh, I do. But I think when you - when we start slinging the racial slurs, you know, I think that's a poor choice on both sides. I think we... MARTIN: Even though he said he would prefer immigrants from Norway, a predominantly white country? GOSAR: You know, looking all the way across the board, you know, for immigrants coming to a country from very different statuses - you know, higher-status living that are presented in Norway versus maybe what you would see in Haiti or in parts of Africa. And that's part of the rule of law. You know, I think that was what his comments were, maybe a very, very poor choice of how to place that. But once again, starting to use the racial slur - I think we've used it way more on both sides. And I think it really clouds the issue of having a very good debate. MARTIN: It is the issue for some people. But I want to move on and ask about the substance of this bill that was brought to the president. Senator Jeff Flake was at the helm of this thing. And it's notable that the president had said earlier - on Tuesday, actually - that he was going to sign anything that congressional members came up with. This is what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: What I approve is going to be very much reliant on what the people in this room come to me with. I have great confidence in the - if they come to me with things that I'm not in love with, I'm going to do it. MARTIN: So why won't the president sign this deal that a bipartisan group brought to him yesterday? GOSAR: Well, first of all, being in the House, I don't always appreciate what the Senate comes up with. So there's that animosity as well. So - but I think the president has been very firm up until that point was - is that a framework for immigration had to have border security, had to have a kibosh to chain migration and other aspects... MARTIN: Which this did. It also just had DACA protections in it to prevent so-called DREAMers from being deported. Do you think that should be included in any immigration bill? GOSAR: Well, I think what we have to do is be very, very careful and that there's no special status that is given until we look at the bigger problem. And that is - why are we taking 700,000 people and moving them to the front of the line in the victim category? Isn't there a bigger category of immigrants that are the victims that are trying to do it the right way that we ought to really concentrate on and make sure that we have the full status in regards to how do we look at our immigration from top to bottom in a fair and equitable way? I think that's the biggest key because the rule of law is key here. MARTIN: All right, we're going to have to leave it there. Congressman Paul Gosar of Arizona, member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, thank you very much for your time this morning. GOSAR: Thanks so much, Rachel. MARTIN: All right. NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow is still in the studio with us. So, Scott, I want to take us back to the beginning of that conversation we just heard with Congressman Gosar. Clearly, Republicans in Congress finding themselves yet again trying to do some cleanup after President Trump says something that they say is just inarticulate. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Sure. Pick a tweet, pick a statement from the campaign and from his presidency - there's dozens to pick from - where Trump says something that many people find incredibly offensive. And you have this dance that many Republicans do - especially in the House, where Trump is deeply popular in many House Republican districts - where they want to distance themselves from the statement, from the tweet, but still support the president. And you heard that again there. DAVID GREENE, HOST: Scott, we, I mean, are spending much of this morning - and we have at different times during this presidency - talking about, like, a tweet or a word. There's policy to talk about, too. I mean, this meeting was at a moment when there has been talk for some time about DACA and immigration being a real place of potential for bipartisan compromise. Where do negotiations stand right now? Is it still heading in that direction despite this moment at the White House? DETROW: Well, after that meeting, Dick Durbin's office said that they still were sticking with the plan of before the meeting. They're trying to sell this agreement that this group of six senators came up with to Congress. It's tough, though, because, well, there's a majority in both Houses who want DACA protectees to stay in this country. Beyond that, it's very hard to reach a compromise that everyone's happy with. A lot of... MARTIN: I mean, we heard this congressman, Gosar, saying that he doesn't want DACA protections. DETROW: Exactly. MARTIN: So at least he has questions. DETROW: And the broader push of wanting to have a big crackdown on illegal immigration and to limit legal immigration is something many Republicans in the House especially want to see. And at the same time, you have Democrats who are resentful of the fact that DACA protectees are part of a broader bargain that would lead to policies they don't like. GREENE: And it's not just immigration. We've been talking about immigration, even infrastructures, things that we might see bipartisan compromise. But you head into a midterm election year where there are a lot of issues where the parties are truly dug in. I mean, there's no guarantee of that. DETROW: That's right. And often it's the activist voices who speak loudest, who influence primaries and who influence the decisions that members in both parties make.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: What I approve is going to be very much reliant on what the people in this room come to me with. I have great confidence in the - if they come to me with things that I'm not in love with, I'm going to do it. MARTIN: So why won't the president sign this deal that a bipartisan group brought to him yesterday? GOSAR: Well, first of all, being in the House, I don't always appreciate what the Senate comes up with. So there's that animosity as well. So - but I think the president has been very firm up until that point was - is that a framework for immigration had to have border security, had to have a kibosh to chain migration and other aspects... MARTIN: Which this did. It also just had DACA protections in it to prevent so-called DREAMers from being deported. Do you think that should be included in any immigration bill? GOSAR: Well, I think what we have to do is be very, very careful and that there's no special status that is given until we look at the bigger problem. And that is - why are we taking 700,000 people and moving them to the front of the line in the victim category? Isn't there a bigger category of immigrants that are the victims that are trying to do it the right way that we ought to really concentrate on and make sure that we have the full status in regards to how do we look at our immigration from top to bottom in a fair and equitable way? I think that's the biggest key because the rule of law is key here. MARTIN: All right, we're going to have to leave it there. Congressman Paul Gosar of Arizona, member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, thank you very much for your time this morning. GOSAR: Thanks so much, Rachel. MARTIN: All right. NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow is still in the studio with us. So, Scott, I want to take us back to the beginning of that conversation we just heard with Congressman Gosar. Clearly, Republicans in Congress finding themselves yet again trying to do some cleanup after President Trump says something that they say is just inarticulate. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Sure. Pick a tweet, pick a statement from the campaign and from his presidency - there's dozens to pick from - where Trump says something that many people find incredibly offensive. And you have this dance that many Republicans do - especially in the House, where Trump is deeply popular in many House Republican districts - where they want to distance themselves from the statement, from the tweet, but still support the president. And you heard that again there. DAVID GREENE, HOST: Scott, we, I mean, are spending much of this morning - and we have at different times during this presidency - talking about, like, a tweet or a word. There's policy to talk about, too. I mean, this meeting was at a moment when there has been talk for some time about DACA and immigration being a real place of potential for bipartisan compromise. Where do negotiations stand right now? Is it still heading in that direction despite this moment at the White House? DETROW: Well, after that meeting, Dick Durbin's office said that they still were sticking with the plan of before the meeting. They're trying to sell this agreement that this group of six senators came up with to Congress. It's tough, though, because, well, there's a majority in both Houses who want DACA protectees to stay in this country. Beyond that, it's very hard to reach a compromise that everyone's happy with. A lot of... MARTIN: I mean, we heard this congressman, Gosar, saying that he doesn't want DACA protections. DETROW: Exactly. MARTIN: So at least he has questions. DETROW: And the broader push of wanting to have a big crackdown on illegal immigration and to limit legal immigration is something many Republicans in the House especially want to see. And at the same time, you have Democrats who are resentful of the fact that DACA protectees are part of a broader bargain that would lead to policies they don't like. GREENE: And it's not just immigration. We've been talking about immigration, even infrastructures, things that we might see bipartisan compromise. But you head into a midterm election year where there are a lot of issues where the parties are truly dug in. I mean, there's no guarantee of that. DETROW: That's right. And often it's the activist voices who speak loudest, who influence primaries and who influence the decisions that members in both parties make. And that's one reason why there has not been a broad bipartisan immigration bill to get to a president's desk in decades. GREENE: NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow. Scott, thanks a lot. DETROW: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF LOWER SPECTRUM'S \"NOCTURNAL\") Copyright © 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

GOSAR: You know, looking all the way across the board, you know, for immigrants coming to a country from very different statuses - you know, higher-status living that are presented in Norway versus maybe what you would see in Haiti or in parts of Africa. And that's part of the rule of law. You know, I think that was what his comments were, maybe a very, very poor choice of how to place that. But once again, starting to use the racial slur - I think we've used it way more on both sides. And I think it really clouds the issue of having a very good debate.

MARTIN: So why won't the president sign this deal that a bipartisan group brought to him yesterday? GOSAR: Well, first of all, being in the House, I don't always appreciate what the Senate comes up with. So there's that animosity as well. So - but I think the president has been very firm up until that point was - is that a framework for immigration had to have border security, had to have a kibosh to chain migration and other aspects... MARTIN: Which this did. It also just had DACA protections in it to prevent so-called DREAMers from being deported. Do you think that should be included in any immigration bill? GOSAR: Well, I think what we have to do is be very, very careful and that there's no special status that is given until we look at the bigger problem. And that is - why are we taking 700,000 people and moving them to the front of the line in the victim category? Isn't there a bigger category of immigrants that are the victims that are trying to do it the right way that we ought to really concentrate on and make sure that we have the full status in regards to how do we look at our immigration from top to bottom in a fair and equitable way? I think that's the biggest key because the rule of law is key here. MARTIN: All right, we're going to have to leave it there. Congressman Paul Gosar of Arizona, member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, thank you very much for your time this morning. GOSAR: Thanks so much, Rachel. MARTIN: All right. NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow is still in the studio with us. So, Scott, I want to take us back to the beginning of that conversation we just heard with Congressman Gosar. Clearly, Republicans in Congress finding themselves yet again trying to do some cleanup after President Trump says something that they say is just inarticulate. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Sure. Pick a tweet, pick a statement from the campaign and from his presidency - there's dozens to pick from - where Trump says something that many people find incredibly offensive. And you have this dance that many Republicans do - especially in the House, where Trump is deeply popular in many House Republican districts - where they want to distance themselves from the statement, from the tweet, but still support the president. And you heard that again there. DAVID GREENE, HOST: Scott, we, I mean, are spending much of this morning - and we have at different times during this presidency - talking about, like, a tweet or a word. There's policy to talk about, too. I mean, this meeting was at a moment when there has been talk for some time about DACA and immigration being a real place of potential for bipartisan compromise. Where do negotiations stand right now? Is it still heading in that direction despite this moment at the White House? DETROW: Well, after that meeting, Dick Durbin's office said that they still were sticking with the plan of before the meeting. They're trying to sell this agreement that this group of six senators came up with to Congress. It's tough, though, because, well, there's a majority in both Houses who want DACA protectees to stay in this country. Beyond that, it's very hard to reach a compromise that everyone's happy with. A lot of... MARTIN: I mean, we heard this congressman, Gosar, saying that he doesn't want DACA protections. DETROW: Exactly. MARTIN: So at least he has questions. DETROW: And the broader push of wanting to have a big crackdown on illegal immigration and to limit legal immigration is something many Republicans in the House especially want to see. And at the same time, you have Democrats who are resentful of the fact that DACA protectees are part of a broader bargain that would lead to policies they don't like. GREENE: And it's not just immigration. We've been talking about immigration, even infrastructures, things that we might see bipartisan compromise. But you head into a midterm election year where there are a lot of issues where the parties are truly dug in. I mean, there's no guarantee of that. DETROW: That's right. And often it's the activist voices who speak loudest, who influence primaries and who influence the decisions that members in both parties make. And that's one reason why there has not been a broad bipartisan immigration bill to get to a president's desk in decades. GREENE: NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow. Scott, thanks a lot.

So - but I think the president has been very firm up until that point was - is that a framework for immigration had to have border security, had to have a kibosh to chain migration and other aspects... MARTIN: Which this did. It also just had DACA protections in it to prevent so-called DREAMers from being deported. Do you think that should be included in any immigration bill? GOSAR: Well, I think what we have to do is be very, very careful and that there's no special status that is given until we look at the bigger problem. And that is - why are we taking 700,000 people and moving them to the front of the line in the victim category? Isn't there a bigger category of immigrants that are the victims that are trying to do it the right way that we ought to really concentrate on and make sure that we have the full status in regards to how do we look at our immigration from top to bottom in a fair and equitable way? I think that's the biggest key because the rule of law is key here. MARTIN: All right, we're going to have to leave it there. Congressman Paul Gosar of Arizona, member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, thank you very much for your time this morning. GOSAR: Thanks so much, Rachel. MARTIN: All right. NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow is still in the studio with us. So, Scott, I want to take us back to the beginning of that conversation we just heard with Congressman Gosar. Clearly, Republicans in Congress finding themselves yet again trying to do some cleanup after President Trump says something that they say is just inarticulate. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Sure. Pick a tweet, pick a statement from the campaign and from his presidency - there's dozens to pick from - where Trump says something that many people find incredibly offensive. And you have this dance that many Republicans do - especially in the House, where Trump is deeply popular in many House Republican districts - where they want to distance themselves from the statement, from the tweet, but still support the president. And you heard that again there. DAVID GREENE, HOST: Scott, we, I mean, are spending much of this morning - and we have at different times during this presidency - talking about, like, a tweet or a word. There's policy to talk about, too. I mean, this meeting was at a moment when there has been talk for some time about DACA and immigration being a real place of potential for bipartisan compromise. Where do negotiations stand right now? Is it still heading in that direction despite this moment at the White House? DETROW: Well, after that meeting, Dick Durbin's office said that they still were sticking with the plan of before the meeting. They're trying to sell this agreement that this group of six senators came up with to Congress. It's tough, though, because, well, there's a majority in both Houses who want DACA protectees to stay in this country. Beyond that, it's very hard to reach a compromise that everyone's happy with. A lot of... MARTIN: I mean, we heard this congressman, Gosar, saying that he doesn't want DACA protections. DETROW: Exactly. MARTIN: So at least he has questions. DETROW: And the broader push of wanting to have a big crackdown on illegal immigration and to limit legal immigration is something many Republicans in the House especially want to see. And at the same time, you have Democrats who are resentful of the fact that DACA protectees are part of a broader bargain that would lead to policies they don't like. GREENE: And it's not just immigration. We've been talking about immigration, even infrastructures, things that we might see bipartisan compromise. But you head into a midterm election year where there are a lot of issues where the parties are truly dug in. I mean, there's no guarantee of that. DETROW: That's right. And often it's the activist voices who speak loudest, who influence primaries and who influence the decisions that members in both parties make. And that's one reason why there has not been a broad bipartisan immigration bill to get to a president's desk in decades. GREENE: NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow. Scott, thanks a lot.

And often it's the activist voices who speak loudest, who influence primaries and who influence the decisions that members in both parties make. And that's one reason why there has not been a broad bipartisan immigration bill to get to a president's desk in decades. GREENE: NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow. Scott, thanks a lot.

So, Scott, I want to take us back to the beginning of that conversation we just heard with Congressman Gosar. Clearly, Republicans in Congress finding themselves yet again trying to do some cleanup after President Trump says something that they say is just inarticulate. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Sure. Pick a tweet, pick a statement from the campaign and from his presidency - there's dozens to pick from - where Trump says something that many people find incredibly offensive. And you have this dance that many Republicans do - especially in the House, where Trump is deeply popular in many House Republican districts - where they want to distance themselves from the statement, from the tweet, but still support the president. And you heard that again there. DAVID GREENE, HOST: Scott, we, I mean, are spending much of this morning - and we have at different times during this presidency - talking about, like, a tweet or a word. There's policy to talk about, too. I mean, this meeting was at a moment when there has been talk for some time about DACA and immigration being a real place of potential for bipartisan compromise. Where do negotiations stand right now? Is it still heading in that direction despite this moment at the White House? DETROW: Well, after that meeting, Dick Durbin's office said that they still were sticking with the plan of before the meeting. They're trying to sell this agreement that this group of six senators came up with to Congress. It's tough, though, because, well, there's a majority in both Houses who want DACA protectees to stay in this country. Beyond that, it's very hard to reach a compromise that everyone's happy with. A lot of... MARTIN: I mean, we heard this congressman, Gosar, saying that he doesn't want DACA protections. DETROW: Exactly. MARTIN: So at least he has questions. DETROW: And the broader push of wanting to have a big crackdown on illegal immigration and to limit legal immigration is something many Republicans in the House especially want to see. And at the same time, you have Democrats who are resentful of the fact that DACA protectees are part of a broader bargain that would lead to policies they don't like. GREENE: And it's not just immigration. We've been talking about immigration, even infrastructures, things that we might see bipartisan compromise.

Some say it violates the First Amendment. Legislators say it's about promoting a \"healthy, civil dialogue.\" Expect court battles ahead.\n\nby Charles Ornstein\n\nThis story was co-published with Slate.\n\nUpdate, Jun. 9, 2017: This story has been updated to add an additional comment from Rep. Paul Gosar's office.\n\nAs President Donald Trump faces criticism for blocking users on his Twitter account, people across the country say they, too, have been cut off by elected officials at all levels of government after voicing dissent on social media.\n\nIn Arizona, a disabled Army veteran grew so angry when her congressman blocked her and others from posting dissenting views on his Facebook page that she began delivering actual blocks to his office.\n\nA central Texas congressman has barred so many constituents on Twitter that a local activist group has begun selling T-shirts complaining about it.\n\nAnd in Kentucky, the Democratic Party is using a hashtag , #BevinBlocked, to track those who've been blocked on social media by Republican Gov. Matt Bevin. (Most of the officials blocking constituents appear to be Republican.)\n\nThe growing combat over social media is igniting a new-age legal debate over whether losing this form of access to public officials violates constituents' First Amendment rights to free speech and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. Those who've been blocked say it's akin to being thrown out of a town hall meeting for holding up a protest sign.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University called upon Trump to unblock people who've disagreed with him or directed criticism at him or his family via the @realdonaldtrump account, which he used prior to becoming president and continues to use as his principal Twitter outlet.\n\nTrump blocked me after this tweet. Let's all hope the courts continue to protect us. Never stop resisting. pic.twitter.com/TlR4zgHCoU\n\n\"Though the architects of the Constitution surely didn't contemplate presidential Twitter accounts, they understood that the president must not be allowed to banish views from public discourse simply because he finds them objectionable,\" Jameel Jaffer, the Knight Institute's executive director, said in a statement.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment, but press secretary Sean Spicer said earlier Tuesday that statements the president makes on Twitter should be regarded as official statements.\n\nSimilar flare-ups have been playing out in state after state.\n\nEarlier this year, the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland called on Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, to stop deleting critical comments and barring people from commenting on his Facebook page. (The Washington Post reported that the governor had blocked 450 people as of February.)\n\nDeborah Jeon, the ACLU's legal director, said Hogan and other elected officials are increasingly foregoing town hall meetings and instead relying on social media as their primary means of communication with constituents. \"That's why it's so problematic,\" she said. \"If people are silenced in that medium,\" they can't effectively interact with their elected representative.\n\nThe governor's office did not respond to a request for comment this week. After the letter, however, it reinstated six of the seven people specifically identified by the ACLU (it said it couldn't find the seventh). \"While the ACLU should be focusing on much more important activities than monitoring the governor's Facebook page, we appreciated them identifying a handful of individuals - out of the over 1 million weekly viewers of the page - that may have been inadvertently denied access,\" a spokeswoman for the governor told the Post .\n\nPractically speaking, being blocked cuts off constituents from many forms of interacting with public officials. On Facebook, it means no posts, no likes and no questions or comments during live events on the page of the blocker. Even older posts that may not be offensive are taken down. On Twitter, being blocked prevents a user from seeing the other person's tweets on his or her timeline.\n\nMoreover, while Twitter and Facebook themselves usually suspend account holders only temporarily for breaking rules, many elected officials don't have established policies for constituents who want to be reinstated. Sometimes a call is enough to reverse it, other times it's not.\n\nEugene Volokh, a constitutional law professor at the UCLA School of Law, said that for municipalities and public agencies, such as police departments, social media accounts would generally be considered \"limited public forums\" and therefore, should be open to all.\n\n\"Once they open it up to public comments, they can't then impose viewpoint-based restrictions on it,\" he said, for instance allowing only supportive comments while deleting critical ones.\n\nBut legislators are different because they are people. Elected officials can have personal accounts, campaign accounts and officeholder accounts that may appear quite similar. On their personal and campaign accounts, there's little disagreement that officials can engage with - or block - whoever they want. Last month, for instance, ProPublica reported how Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., blocked users on his campaign account after they criticized his positions on health reform and other issues.\n\nBut what about their officeholder social media accounts?\n\nThe ACLU's Jeon says that they should be public if they use government resources, including staff time and office equipment to maintain the page. \"Where that's the situation and taxpayer resources are going to it, then the full power of the First Amendment applies,\" she said. \"It doesn't matter if they're members of Congress or the governor or a local councilperson.\"\n\nVolokh of UCLA disagreed. He said that members of Congress are entitled to their own private speech, even on official pages. That's because each is one voice among many, as opposed to a governor or mayor. \"It's clear that whatever my senator is, she's not the government . She is one person who is part of a legislative body,\" he said. \"She was elected because she has her own views and it makes sense that if she has a Twitter feed or a Facebook page, that may well be seen as not government speech but the voice of somebody who may be a government official.\"\n\nVolokh said he's inclined to see Trump's @realdonaldtrump account as a personal one, though other legal experts disagree.\n\n\"You could imagine actually some other president running this kind of account in a way that's very public minded - 'I'm just going to express the views of the executive branch,'\" he said. \"The @realdonaldtrump account is very much, 'I'm Donald Trump. I'm going to be expressing my views, and if you don't like it, too bad for you.' That sounds like private speech, even done by a government official on government property.\"\n\nIt's possible the fight over the president's Twitter account will end up in court, as such disputes have across the country. Generally, in these situations, the people contesting the government's social media policies have reached settlements ending the questionable practices.\n\nAfter being sued by the ACLU, three cities in Indiana agreed last year to change their policies by no longer blocking users or deleting comments.\n\nIn 2014, a federal judge ordered the City and County of Honolulu to pay $31,000 in attorney's fees to people who sued, contending that the Honolulu Police Department violated their constitutional rights by deleting their critical Facebook posts.\n\nAnd San Diego County agreed to pay the attorney's fees of a gun parts dealer who sued after its Sheriff's Department deleted two Facebook posts that were critical of the sheriff and banned the dealer from commenting. The department took down its Facebook page after being sued and paid the dealer $20 as part of the settlement.\n\nAngela Greben, a California paralegal, has spent the past two years gathering information about agencies and politicians that have blocked people on social media - Democrats and Republican alike - filing ethics complaints and even a lawsuit against the city of San Mateo, California, its mayor and police department. (They settled with her, giving her some of what she wanted.)\n\nGreben has filed numerous public-records requests to agencies as varied as the Transportation Security Administration, the Seattle Police Department and the Connecticut Lottery seeking lists of people they block. She's posted the results online .\n\n\"It shouldn't be up to the elected official to decide who can tweet them and who can't,\" she said. \"Everybody deserves to be treated equally and fairly under the law.\"\n\nEven though she lives in California, Greben recently filed an ethics complaint against Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed , a Democrat, who has been criticized for blocking not only constituents but also journalists who cover him . Reed has blocked Greben since 2015 when she tweeted about him ... well, blocking people on Twitter. \"He's notorious for blocking and muting people,\" she said, meaning he can't see their tweets but they can still see his.\n\n@LizLemeryJoy @KasimReed Mr. Mayor you are violating the #civilrights of all you have #blocked ! @Georgia_AG @FOX5Atlanta @11AliveNews\n\nIn a statement, a city spokeswoman defended the mayor, saying he's now among the top five most-followed mayors in the country. \"Mayor Reed uses social media as a personal platform to engage directly with constituents and some journalists. ... Like all Twitter users, Mayor Reed has the right to stop engaging in conversations when he determines they are unproductive, intentionally inflammatory, dishonest and/or misleading.\"\n\nAsked how many people he has blocked, she replied that the office doesn't keep such a list.\n\nJ'aime Morgaine, the Arizona veteran who delivered blocks to the office of Rep. Paul Gosar, a Republican, said being blocked on Facebook matters because her representative no longer hosts in-person town hall meetings and has started to answer questions on Facebook Live. Now she can't ask questions or leave comments.\n\n\"I have lost and other people who have been blocked have lost our right to participate in the democratic process,\" said Morgaine, leader of Indivisible Kingman, a group that opposes the president's agenda. \"I am outraged that my congressman is blocking my voice and trampling upon my constitutional rights.\"\n\n@RepGosar ..You weren't home when I delivered this message to your office, but no worries...there WILL be more! Stop BLOCKING Constituents! pic.twitter.com/JTWGQwhxKt\n\nMorgaine said the rules are not being applied equally. \"They're not blocking everybody who's angry,\" she said. \"They're blocking the voices of dissent, and there's no process for getting unblocked. There's no appeals process. There's no accountability.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for Gosar defended his decision to block constituents but did not answer a question about how many have been blocked.\n\n\"Congressman Gosar's policy has been consistent since taking office in January 2010,\" spokeswoman Kelly Roberson said in an email. \"In short: 'Users whose comments or posts consist of profanity, hate speech, personal attacks, homophobia or Islamophobia may be banned.'\"\n\nOn his Facebook page, Gosar posts the policy that guides his actions. It says in part, \"Users are banned to promote healthy, civil dialogue on this page but are welcome to contact Congressman Gosar using other methods,\" including phone calls, emails and letters.\n\nAfter this article was published, Gosar's office took issue with the claim that it blocks users who voice dissenting views, saying that Morgaine has acknowledged she may have used profanity. A review of other blocked users' tweets, however, appears to show more run-of-the-mill disagreement or criticism, some more polite than others.\n\nSometimes, users are blocked repeatedly.\n\nCommunity volunteer Gayle Lacy was named 2015 Wacoan of the Year for her effort to have the site of mammoth fossils in Waco, Texas, designated a national monument. Lacy's latest fight has been with her congressman, Bill Flores, who was with her in the Oval Office when Obama designated the site a national monument in 2015. She has been blocked three times by Flores' congressional Twitter account and once by his campaign account. One of those blocks happened after she tweeted at him: \"My father died in service for this country, but you are not representative of that country and neither is your dear leader.\"\n\nLacy said she was able to get unblocked each time from Flores' congressional account by calling his office but remains blocked on the campaign one. \"I don't know where to call,\" she said. \"I asked in his D.C. office who I needed to call and I was told that they don't have that information.\"\n\nWe're looking for civically engaged people to help us fact-check what members of Congress are sending to their constituents.\n\nLacy and others said Flores blocks those who question him. Austin lawyer Matt Miller said he was blocked for asking when Flores would hold a town hall meeting. \"It's totally inappropriate to block somebody, especially for asking a legitimate question of my elected representative,\" Miller said.\n\nIn a statement, Flores spokesman Andre Castro said Flores makes his policies clear on Twitter and on Facebook. \"We reserve the right to block users whose comments include profanity, name-calling, threats, personal attacks, constant harping, inappropriate or false accusations, or other inappropriate comments or material. As the Congressman likes to say - 'If you would not say it to your grandmother, we will not allow it here.'\"\n\nRicardo Guerrero, an Austin marketer who is one of the leaders of a local group opposed to Trump's agenda, said he has gotten unblocked by Flores twice but then was blocked again and \"just kind of gave up.\"\n\n\"He's creating an echo chamber of only the people that agree with him,\" Guerrero said of Flores. \"He's purposefully removing any semblance of debate or alternative ideas or ideas that challenge his own - and that seems completely undemocratic. That's the bigger issue in my mind.\"\n\nProPublica also has been tracking legislators sending misinformation to constituents about the Affordable Care Act and its repeal.

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\nWe filed public-records requests with all 50 governors and 22 federal agencies. Here's what we found.\n\nby Leora Smith and Derek Kravitz\n\nAmanda Farber still doesn't know why Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan blocked her from his Facebook group. A resident of Bethesda and full-time parent and volunteer, Farber identifies as a Democrat but voted for the Republican Hogan in 2014. Farber says she doesn't post on her representatives' pages often. But earlier this year, she said she wrote on the governor's Facebook page, asking him to oppose the Trump administration's travel ban and health care proposal.\n\nShe never received a response. When she later returned to the page, she noticed her comment had been deleted. She also noticed she had been blocked from commenting. (She is still allowed to share the governor's posts and messages.)\n\nFarber has repeatedly emailed and called Hogan's office, asking them to remove her from their blacklist. She remains blocked. According to documents ProPublica obtained through an open-records request this summer, hers is one of 494 accounts that Hogan blocks. Blocked accounts include a schoolteacher who criticized the governor's education policies and a pastor who opposed the governor's stance against accepting Syrian refugees. They even have their own Facebook group: Marylanders Blocked by Larry Hogan on Facebook .\n\nHogan's office says they \"diligently adhere\" to their social media policy when deleting comments and blocking users.\n\nIn August, ProPublica filed public-records requests with every governor and 22 federal agencies, asking for lists of everyone blocked on their official Facebook and Twitter accounts. The responses we've received so far show that governors and agencies across the country are blocking at least 1,298 accounts. More than half of those - 652 accounts - are blocked by Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican.\n\nFour other Republican governors and four Democrats, as well as five federal agencies, block hundreds of others, according to their responses to our requests. Five Republican governors and three Democrats responded that they are not blocking any accounts at all. Many agencies and more than half of governors' offices have not yet responded to our requests. Most of the blocked accounts appear to belong to humans but some could be \"bots,\" or automated accounts.\n\nWhen the administrator of a public Facebook page or Twitter handle blocks an account, the blocked user can no longer comment on posts. That can create an inaccurate public image of support for government policies. ( Here's how you can dig into whether your elected officials are blocking constituents. )\n\nIf you're interested in finding out who is blocked in your home state or municipality, check out our reporting recipe .\n\nProPublica made the records requests and asked readers for their own examples after we detailed multiple instances of officials blocking constituents.\n\nWe heard from dozens of people. The governors' offices in Alaska, Maine, Mississippi, Nebraska and New Jersey did not respond to our requests for records, but residents in each of those states reported being blocked. People were blocked after commenting on everything from marijuana legislation to Medicaid to a local green jobs bill.\n\nFor some, being blocked means losing one of few means to communicate with their elected representatives. Ann-Meredith McNeill, who lives in western rural Kentucky, told ProPublica that Bevin rarely visits anywhere near her. McNeill said she feels like \"the internet is all I have\" for interacting with the governor.\n\nMcNeill said she was blocked after criticizing Bevin's position on abortion rights. (Last January, Bevin's administration won a lawsuit that resulted in closing one of Kentucky's two abortion clinics , the event that McNeill says inspired her comment.)\n\nIn response to questions about its social media blocking policies, Bevin's office said in a statement that \"a small number of users misuse [social media] outlets by posting obscene and abusive language or images, or repeated off-topic comments and spam. Constituents of all ages should be able to engage in civil discourse with Gov. Bevin via his social media platforms without being subjected to vulgarity or abusive trolls.\" McNeill told ProPublica, \"I'm sure I got sassy\" but she made \"no threats or anything.\"\n\nAnd here's why that's a story.\n\nAlmost every federal agency that responded is blocking accounts. The Department of Veterans Affairs blocked 18 accounts as of July, but said most were originally blocked before 2014. The blocked accounts included a Michigan law firm specializing in auto accident cases and a Virginia real estate consultant who told ProPublica she had \"no idea why\" she was blocked. The Department of Energy blocked eight accounts as of October. The Department of Labor blocked seven accounts. And the Small Business Administration blocked two accounts, both of which were unverified and claimed to be affiliated with government loan programs.\n\nMany governors and agencies gave us only partial lists or rejected our requests altogether. Outgoing Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback's office told us they would not share their block lists due to \"privacy concerns for those people whose names might appear on it.\" Alabama declined to provide public records because our request did not come from an Alabama citizen .\n\nMissouri Gov. Eric Greitens' office declined to share records from his Facebook or Twitter accounts, arguing they are not \" considered to be the 'official' social media accounts of the Governor of Missouri \" because he created them before he took office.\n\nIncreased attention on the issue of blocking seems to be having an impact. In September, the California-based First Amendment Coalition revealed that California Gov.

      "text": "Building the \"Big Lie\": Inside the Creation of Trump's Stolen Election Myth\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThis story is part of an ongoing collaborative reporting effort between ProPublica and FRONTLINE that includes the documentary film \"Plot to Overturn the Election.\" The film aired recently on PBS and can be viewed here .\n\nBy the time Leamsy Salazar sat down in front of a video recorder in a lawyer's office in Dallas, he had grown accustomed to divulging state secrets. After swearing to tell nothing but the truth so help him God, he recounted that he was born in Venezuela in 1974, enlisted in the army and rose through its special operations ranks. He described how in 2007 he became the chief of security for Hugo Chávez, the Venezuelan leader whose electoral victories had been challenged by outside observers and opposition parties. After Chávez died in 2013, Salazar said he provided intelligence on top Venezuelan officials involved in drug trafficking to American law enforcement agencies, which had helped him defect.\n\nAfter about 45 minutes of Salazar telling his life story, the lawyer questioning him, Lewis Sessions, abruptly changed the course of the conversation. \"I want to take a moment to get off the track,\" said Sessions, the brother of Republican Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas. \"Why are you here? What has motivated you to come forward?\"\n\n\"I feel that the world should know - they should know the truth,\" Salazar answered. \"The truth about the corruption. About the manipulation. About the lies.\"\n\n\"The truth about what?\" Sessions asked.\n\n\"In this case, it's the manipulation of votes,\" Salazar said. \"And the lies being told to a country.\"\n\nThat morning of Nov. 13, 2020, Salazar had a new sort of intelligence to share. He claimed to know that the 2020 U.S. presidential election had been rigged - and how.\n\nSpeaking through an interpreter, Salazar said that when he worked for Chávez, he had attended meetings in which the administration discussed how to develop specialized software to steal elections with representatives from Smartmatic, a voting technology company whose founders had ties to Venezuela. He recalled that during the 2013 presidential election , in a secret counting center in Caracas, the capital, he saw officials use software to change votes in favor of Chávez's successor, Nicolás Maduro, after the polls closed. Watching the 2020 American election, he said, he noticed votes for Joe Biden jumping in a pattern that he thought was similar.\n\nWhen Sessions asked if Salazar could draw a connection between the events in Venezuela and the recent American election, Salazar replied, \"I can show the similarity.\" In the 2020 election, Smartmatic machines were only used in Los Angeles, but Salazar explained away this discrepancy. He claimed that the company's software had been \"purchased\" by Dominion Voting Systems, whose machines were used in such battleground states as Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - all of which had gone to Biden, sealing his victory over Donald Trump.\n\nSalazar said in a subsequent court filing that he had taken his concerns about the election to \"a number of reliable and intelligent ex-co-workers of mine that are still informants and work with the intelligence community.\" (He did not specify whether he meant the U.S. or Venezuelan intelligence community.) From there, sources told ProPublica, his concerns reached a former intelligence officer active in Republican politics and then the conservative lawyer Sidney Powell.\n\nPowell was on the hunt for just such information.\n\nBy the second week of November, it had become known in right-wing circles that she was working behind the scenes with the president's legal team to challenge the results of the election. In an email to ProPublica, Sessions wrote that he \"conducted the interview at the request of a person working with Sidney Powell's legal team.\" The day after the interview, Trump made Powell's position official with an announcement on Twitter.\n\nThe following morning, Powell traveled to South Carolina, where a loose coalition of lawyers, cybersecurity experts and former military intelligence officers were gathering on a plantation owned by the defamation lawyer Lin Wood to search for evidence of election fraud. One person present at the plantation said that Wood and Powell treated the Salazar video \"like the holy grail of evidence.\" (In an email to ProPublica, Wood wrote that he was not part of any coalition and that he had only seen \"a few minutes\" of the video, in which he had \"no interest beyond general curiosity.\" Powell did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nThere was just one problem. Salazar's claims were easily disprovable. Hours after the video was recorded, Trump campaign staffers reviewed some allegations about Dominion that were almost identical, and it took them less than a day to discover they were baseless. The staffers prepared an internal memo with section headings that read: \"Dominion Has No Company Ties To Venezuela,\" \"Dominion And Smartmatic Terminated Their Contract In 2012\" and \"There Is No Evidence That Dominion Used Smartmatic's Software In The 2020 Election Cycle.\" Independent fact-checkers came to the same conclusions . Dominion later released a statement calling a version of these allegations that Powell pushed in a lawsuit, \"baseless, senseless, physically impossible, and unsupported by any evidence whatsoever.\" A lawyer for Smartmatic wrote to ProPublica: \"There are no ties between Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic - plain and simple.\" He added that \"Salazar's testimony is full of inaccuracies,\" strongly denied that Smartmatic's technology was designed to steal Venezuelan elections, and said the company, which operates worldwide, has \"registered and counted over 5 billion votes without a single security breach.\" (Salazar did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nSalazar's story was just one of many pieces of so-called evidence that members of the coalition have offered as proof that the 2020 election was rigged. That unfounded belief has emerged as one of the most potent forces in American politics. Numerous polls show that over two-thirds of Republicans doubt the legitimacy of the 2020 election. Millions of those Republicans believe foreign governments reprogrammed American voting machines.\n\nProPublica has obtained a trove of internal emails and other documentation that, taken together, tell the inside story of a group of people who propagated a number of the most pervasive theories about how the election was stolen, especially that voting machines were to blame, and helped move them from the far-right fringe to the center of the Republican Party.\n\nThose records, as well as interviews with key participants, show for the first time the extent to which leading advocates of the stolen-election theory touted evidence that they knew to be disproven or that had been credibly disputed or dismissed as dubious by operatives within their own camp. Some members of the coalition presented this mix of unreliable witnesses, unconfirmed rumor and suspect analyses as fact in published reports, talking points and court documents. In several cases, their assertions became the basis for Trump's claims that the election had been rigged.\n\nOur examination of their actions from the 2020 election to the present day reveals a pattern. Many members of the coalition would advance a theory based on evidence that was never vetted or that they'd been told was flawed; then, when the theory was debunked, they'd move on to the next alternative and then the next.\n\nThe coalition includes several figures who have attracted national attention. Retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, who served briefly as national security adviser to Trump before pleading guilty to lying to law enforcement about his contacts with Russian officials, is the most well known. Patrick Byrne, the former CEO of Overstock.com who left his position after his romantic relationship with the convicted Russian agent Maria Butina became public, is the coalition's chief financier and a frequent intermediary with the press. Powell, who represented Flynn in his attempt to reverse his guilty plea, spearheaded efforts in the courts.\n\nBefore Powell arrived at the plantation, Wood had filed a lawsuit in federal court in Atlanta against Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger that sought to stop him from certifying Biden's victory. Soon after Powell showed up, Wood submitted an anonymized declaration from Salazar as evidence of how the election was corrupted. He then filed an emergency motion that sought access to Dominion machines in Georgia to \"conduct a forensic inspection of this equipment and the data therein.\" The case was eventually dismissed, but it would serve as a template for the series of high-profile lawsuits that Powell would file in Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia.\n\nSalazar's declaration was central to the four lawsuits, and it went further than the assertions he had made in the video. His claim that he could show \"the similarity\" between anomalies in Venezuelan and American elections expanded to become an allegation that \"the DNA of every vote tabulating company's software and system\" in the United States was potentially compromised.\n\nWood told ProPublica, \"I was not involved in the vetting, drafting or filing any of the lawsuits filed by Sidney Powell,\" though his name appears as \"of counsel\" in all four. A judge sanctioned him in the Michigan case, writing that \"while Wood now seeks to distance himself from this litigation to avoid sanctions, the Court concludes that he was aware of this lawsuit when it was filed, was aware that he was identified as co-counsel for Plaintiffs, and as a result, shares the responsibility with the other lawyers for any sanctionable conduct.\"\n\nAll the lawsuits would fail, with judges excoriating the quality of their evidence. It wasn't just the evidence in the lawsuits that was flawed. In fact, much of the evidence that members of the coalition contributed to the stolen election myth outside the courts was also weak. Yet the coalition's failure to prove its theories has not hindered its ability to spread them.\n\nThis is the story of how little untruths added up to the \"big lie.\"\n\nWhen Powell and Rudy Giuliani, who was leading the Trump campaign's legal team in challenging the vote, began investigating election fraud in November 2020, they quickly were inundated with tips. This flood increased once Wood and others began soliciting evidence on far-right message boards and mainstream social media platforms.\n\nSome of the participants at the plantation described the inundation of claims, which overwhelmed their inboxes, as a type of evidence in itself: There must be something to allegations of election fraud if so many people were making them. ProPublica spoke to eight sources with firsthand knowledge of the coalition's efforts on the plantation, many of whom said they worked relentlessly in a chaotic environment. Tips that easily could have been dismissed as dubious instead were treated as credible.\n\nIn examining hundreds of emails sent to the plantation, ProPublica found that some were hearsay or anecdotes seemingly misinterpreting everyday events; others were internet rumors; and many were recycled narratives that some members of the coalition had pushed on social media. None of the tips that ProPublica examined provided concrete proof of election fraud or manipulation.\n\nOne of the first tips Powell and Giuliani promoted came from Joe Oltmann, a Denver-based conservative podcast host who said he had infiltrated an antifa conference call and had heard a high-level Dominion employee named Eric Coomer declare that he would make sure that Trump lost the election. Powell and Giuliani highlighte d Oltmann's claim at a press conference on Nov. 19, 2020, at the Republican National Committee headquarters.\n\nBy that time, Powell was paying for an investigator to travel to Denver, according to a person familiar with the events. The investigator, the source said, interviewed Oltmann at a brewery in Castle Rock, Colorado, and spent several days checking out his story. Not long after the press conference, according to the source, the investigator emailed Powell his assessment that Oltmann was at the very least embellishing, but she did not respond. Powell soon referred to Oltmann's allegations in court filings in Georgia and Michigan; roughly a week later, she submitted an affidavit from Oltmann in the Arizona and Wisconsin lawsuits. Coomer has denied being on the call and has brought a defamation suit against Oltmann, Powell, Giuliani, the Trump campaign and others. Oltmann has never presented proof of Coomer being on the call, and in March 2022, the judge overseeing the defamation case sanctioned Oltmann, fining him almost $33,000 for failing to appear for a deposition. When Powell was asked in a July 2021 deposition if she had anyone look into Oltmann and \"his background,\" she said she did not recall. (Oltmann did not provide responses to questions about the investigator's assessment.)\n\nWithin days of the investigator's Oltmann probe, Powell turned to another dubious witness: Terpsehore Maras, a QAnon-promoting social media influencer and podcaster who goes by the online handle Tore Says.\n\nIn September 2020, in a civil consumer-fraud judgment in North Dakota, Maras had been found to have made false online charitable fundraising solicitations and to have created \"an entirely fake online persona.\" (Maras has claimed that the allegations against her remain \"unproven\" despite the legal finding and that \"false identities were imperative for me to execute my duties,\" which include being a \"former private intelligence contractor, whistleblower, and investigative journalist.\")\n\nPowell filed a declaration in early December 2020 from an anonymous individual in the Arizona and Wisconsin lawsuits. The individual claimed that there was \"unambiguous evidence\" that \"foreign interference is present in the 2020 election\" and pointed to a vast and unproven conspiracy that involved Dominion, George Soros, a company with an office in China, and the Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama administrations. The Washington Post later identified the declaration's author to be Maras.\n\nIn the weeks after the election, Maras presented herself to Byrne as knowledgeable about election fraud. But he discovered that she was unreliable after he had a team of investigators debrief her. Byrne and Maras said the debriefing occurred after Powell filed the declaration.\n\nIn an email to another witness he had debriefed, Byrne described the investigators' assessment: \"Tore was taken out and interviewed by some people I know from the intelligence community who are absolutely on our side. They came back telling me: 'She knows some things and has been behind the curtain, but she also lies, exaggerates, deflects, changes subject rapidly trying to throw people off, and we cannot rely on her for anything factual because we caught her in too many lies and exaggerations over three hours.'\" (\"I tried my best to deceive\" the debriefers, Maras wrote on her blog in response to questions from ProPublica. \"I was scared.\")\n\nByrne has since repeatedly promoted Maras' right-wing activism, as he does in this September 2021 video , some of which revolves around questioning the legitimacy of the election. (\"She's a friend and an ally, and I know that she's a little goofy,\" Byrne told ProPublica in an interview, explaining that he had recently been impressed by work she had done on their shared causes. \"I think she has relevant knowledge.\")\n\nByrne, Powell and other coalition members weren't just relying on witness statements in their effort to prove the election was rigged. Some of them also pointed to multiple mathematical analyses. One that Powell and Byrne advanced came from a man named Edward Solomon. In the weeks after Nov. 3, 2020, Solomon produced a series of online videos purporting to demonstrate how algorithms adjusted the vote total in Biden's favor.\n\nBefore Byrne and Powell highlighted Solomon's voting analysis, he came to public attention briefly in 2016, after authorities seized 240 bags of heroin, 25 grams of cocaine and weapons from his home; he later pleaded guilty to selling drugs. (Solomon did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nOne person who coalition members entrusted to vet Solomon's analysis was Seth Keshel, a former Army intelligence officer who was brought into the group by Flynn and who acknowledged to ProPublica that his mathematical expertise drew from \"a long track record of baseball statistics.\" In the end, his level of expertise didn't matter; because of a server error, the emailed request to vet Solomon never reached Keshel, who said he had no memory of checking Solomon's claims.\n\nByrne used Solomon's analysis in his book, \"The Deep Rig,\" to make the case that the election was fraudulent. In February 2021, a month after the book was published, the University of Pennsylvania's FactCheck.org reported that officials at the college Solomon had attended said that, though he had been a math major, he had never received a degree. The article quoted experts who pointed to flaws in Solomon's analysis, especially that the \"vote shares\" he suggested were suspicious were \"not at all surprising,\" and a Georgia elections official who said that Solomon \"shows a basic misunderstanding of how vote counts work.\"\n\nA paper posted that month by University of Chicago and Stanford researchers found that the numbers Solomon had said were suspicious were normal for a fraud-free election and that by not considering this, his analysis was a classic example of how \"fishing for a finding\" can \"lead an argument astray.\"\n\nByrne kept promoting Solomon's work until at least July 2021, when he described him in a blog post as a \"Renowned Mathematician.\"\n\nFive months after the FactCheck.org story and the research paper, Powell was asked in a sworn deposition which mathematicians or statisticians she relied on to support her belief that the election was fraudulent. She cited among others a \"Mr. Solomon.\"\n\nIn addition to relying on the flawed claims of Salazar, Oltmann, Maras and Solomon, Powell also promoted the assertions of an Arizona woman named Staci Burk, who had contributed to two fraud rumors after the election. In the first, Burk claimed that she'd spoken with a worker at a FedEx operations center in Seattle who had observed suspicious canvas bags marked as \" election mail ballots \" passing through the facility. The second involved a South Korean airplane flying fake ballots for Biden into Phoenix a few days after the election; Burk said that she had recorded a man who had confessed to the scheme.\n\nA lawsuit that Powell filed in Arizona on Dec. 2, 2020, later included a \"Jane Doe\" witness who would \"testify about illegal ballots being shipped around the United States including to Arizona.\" Burk told ProPublica that she was the \"Jane Doe.\" The same day that Powell filed the Arizona lawsuit, she claimed at a rally outside of Atlanta to have evidence of \"a plane full of ballots that came in,\" and she continued pushing the idea, declaring in a Dec. 5 interview with the host of a YouTube channel, \"We have evidence of a significant plane-load of ballots coming in.\" The judge tossed the case before Burk could testify.\n\nBurk's theories proved false, and at least three coalition members were informed of this. Byrne said that he passed Burk's claims to a contact at the Department of Homeland Security, who told him about a week later that it \"had been looked into and there was nothing there.\" This was in November 2020, before Powell filed her lawsuit. Byrne said that he let some of his associates know that Homeland Security had dismissed the claim but was unsure if he informed Powell. (He also said that later his contact showed renewed interest in the idea.)\n\nOn a phone call in late December, James Penrose, a former senior official for the National Security Agency who had been at the plantation and described himself as working for Wood and Powell, told Burk that he had spent $75,000 on a team of former FBI analysts turned private investigators to check out the theories. On the call, which she recorded, Penrose said that the investigators had tracked the claims about the South Korean airplane to the person who first made them. \"When he was pressed, that guy admitted that he made it up because he hated the MAGA people that he worked with. And he was purposely trying to troll them by saying he saw ballots on the plane,\" Penrose told Burk. \"That created the rumor.\" The man whom Burk recorded confessing to his involvement in the ballot scheme told Penrose's investigators that in trying to impress Burk \"he fabricated everything.\"\n\n\"I mean, are you saying that it - that none of it's true?\" Burk asked. Penrose replied: \"Yes. I'm saying that the entire thing was fabricated. It's all bullshit.\"\n\nPenrose's team had also checked out the Seattle FedEx incident, and he told Burk, \"We're not able to confirm anything that looked like conspiracy along those lines.\"\n\nNeither Penrose nor anyone associated with the coalition ever publicly released the findings of the investigation. (Penrose did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nBurk has since renounced her belief in the rumors she had once backed. \"I obviously made a mistake believing lies,\" Burk wrote to ProPublica. She said she had come to believe that some members of the coalition had manipulated her and her stories to further their ends. \"As things unfolded over time, it became apparent I [was] used as a theatre set piece.\"\n\nBurk's stories would shape the audit of the election results that Arizona legislators would later authorize - and which Byrne, Flynn, Powell, Wood and other associates helped fund, contributing about $5.7 million. The 2021 audit was criticized by elections experts and uncovered no proof of fraud.\n\n\"You have no idea how widespread the belief is in Arizona to this day that there's 300,000 ballots that were brought in via an airplane,\" said Doug Logan, a coalition member who worked with Penrose on the plantation and whose company Cyber Ninjas would run the audit. Logan said that Penrose told him that the woman's theories were false. Still, Logan said, he had auditors examine ballots to check a range of theories, including whether bamboo fibers were mixed into the paper, which auditors believed could show that they were imported from Asia. \"Our goal in the audit was to figure out what's really true and deal with it,\" Logan told ProPublica. \"That's why we did paper examination.\"\n\nNo fibers were found.\n\nFew pieces of evidence were more consequential to the stolen-election theory than a report that claimed to have found evidence of intentional election fraud in Dominion voting machines in Antrim County, Michigan. It was heralded as technical proof that votes were stolen for Biden. It was repeatedly promoted by the president. And Byrne and other proponents of the stolen election myth continued to refer to it when speaking to ProPublica reporters.\n\nHowever, one of the authors of the report recently told ProPublica that the original version never found definitive evidence of election fraud in the Antrim voting machines.\n\n\"There was no proof at that specific moment,\" the author, Conan James Hayes, said. He described finding what he considered a surprising number of errors in the data logs that he thought \"could lead to\" election fraud. \"But there was no, like, 'There was election fraud,'\" he said, \"at least at that time in my mind.\"\n\nAntrim had been the subject of national attention when, on election night, returns showed that Biden had unexpectedly won the Republican stronghold. The next day, the county clerk, a Republican who supported Trump, explained that officials had discovered that a clerical error had switched roughly 3,000 votes from the president to Biden. After the clerk's office made corrections, Trump, as expected, had won the county with more than 60% of the vote.\n\nInternal documents reviewed by ProPublica reveal that some members of the coalition almost immediately suspected that the mistake in Antrim was not human error. Rather, it was an incident in which the voting machine software hadn't been surreptitious enough in stealing votes and unintentionally revealed itself. Their logic was simple: If they could do a forensic audit of the Antrim machines, they could finally establish how the election was stolen. The challenge was how to access the machines.\n\nThe day after Thanksgiving 2020, Byrne paid for a private plane to fly two cybersecurity specialists working with the coalition to Antrim: Hayes, a former professional surfer who had taught himself about computers, and Todd Sanders, a Texas businessman with a cybersecurity consulting business. Hayes and Sanders were turned away from the first two offices they tried, but at a third, a county worker agreed to unroll voting tabulation scrolls, which they photographed.\n\nHighlighting discrepancies in the vote tally produced by the error, a Michigan lawyer won a court order to allow the machines to be formally accessed. On Dec. 6, Hayes, Sanders, a deputy for Giuliani and data forensic specialists engaged by Wood flew to Antrim, again on a private plane paid for by Byrne, and imaged the hard drives of a computer that was the county's election management server.\n\nHayes and Sanders returned to Washington, where they examined the data and, in less than a week, assembled a report. Hayes and another individual familiar with the original version described it as a straightforward technical document, which noted aspects about the data that seemed suspicious but was cautious about claiming election fraud. Then the report was turned over to Russell J. Ramsland, the head of Allied Security Operations Group, a small security contracting company connected to Texas conservative circles.\n\nWhen the report was released after a court hearing on Dec. 14, it was a very different document, according to Hayes and the other person familiar with the original version. It had \"REVISED PRELIMINARY SUMMARY, v2\" and Ramsland's name at the top and his signature at the bottom, and it made an outright accusation. \"The Dominion Voting System is intentionally and purposefully designed with inherent errors to create systemic fraud and influence election results,\" it claimed. \"This leads to voter or election fraud.\" Allied Security, it said, had discovered enough proof of election fraud to decertify the results in Antrim.\n\nHayes' and Sanders' names were nowhere on the report. Hayes told ProPublica that the new \"information must have been written by\" Allied Security. (Sanders did not respond to repeated requests for comment.)\n\nIt wasn't just people associated with the original report who believed Ramsland's version was flawed. An analysis commissioned by the Michigan secretary of state found that the report contained an \"extraordinary number of false, inaccurate, or unsubstantiated statements,\" including that \"the errors in the log file do not mean what Mr. Ramsland purports them to\" and were instead \"benign\" lines of code generated by processes that did not affect the vote outcome. A bipartisan investigation led by Republican legislators in Michigan declared that the Antrim theories are \"a complete waste of time to consider.\" (Ramsland did not respond to ProPublica's questions about revising the report. But he did tell The Washington Post that the Michigan analysis only addressed 12 of Allied Security's 29 \"core observations.\")\n\nTrump supporters immediately seized on the report as definitive proof that the election was rigged. Flynn tweeted, \"MI forensics report shows a massive breakdown in national security & must be dealt w/ immediately. @realDonaldTrump must appoint a special counsel now.\" Byrne and Flynn lobbied for Powell to become the special counsel.\n\nIn a statement, Giuliani said: \"This new revelation makes it clear that the vote count being presented now by the democrats in Michigan constitutes an intentionally false and misleading representation of the final vote tally. The Electors simply cannot be certified based on these demonstrably false vote counts.\" (Giuliani did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nByrne described the report as a \"BOMBSHELL,\" posting it on his blog under the claim: \"You wanted the evidence. Here is the evidence.\"\n\nTrump tweeted: \"WOW. This report shows massive fraud. Election changing result!\" Over the next three days, on social media, he promoted the Antrim report and suspicions about Dominion voting machines 11 times.\n\nLate on the afternoon of Dec. 14, Trump's personal secretary sent an email to the deputy attorney general with the subject line \"From POTUS.\" The Antrim report was attached to the email. An additional document included talking points (\"This is a Cover-up of voting crimes\") and conclusions (\"these election results cannot be certified in Antrim County\"). That email launched Trump's attempt to persuade the Department of Justice to assist in overturning the election results, according to a 2021 report by Senate Democrats. In the end, the deputy attorney general rebuffed the president, and officials in the department threatened to resign en masse if he was replaced.\n\nWhen Trump demanded that Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger \"find 11,780 votes,\" enough for him to win the state, in a recorded phone call on Jan. 2, the president mentioned the Dominion conspiracy 10 times.\n\nAt the Jan. 6 \"Save America\" rally on the Ellipse, directly before Trump spoke, Giuliani took the stage and suggested that halting the certification of Biden's victory was justified because of \"these crooked Dominion machines.\"\n\nTrump's speech emphasized the \"highly troubling matter of Dominion Voting Systems\" and the events in Antrim to explain that the election had been stolen.\n\nNot long after, while Trump supporters made their initial assault on police barricades, Republican Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona was on the House floor objecting to the certification of his state's electoral votes - the beginning of the effort to block the certification of Biden's victory by Congress. He cited as evidence \"the Dominion voting machines with a documented history of enabling fraud.\" About a minute later, Gosar's speech was interrupted and then cut off. The crowd was storming the Capitol. One person in the throng raised a sign that read, \"No Machines Dominion STEALS.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack on the Capitol, many of the same people who had pushed the claims about Dominion repackaged their theory of how the election was stolen. It relied on the same data and the same arguments, except now it had a new name.\n\nThis transformation happened after Dominion's parent company filed a lawsuit against Powell for defamation in a Washington court on Jan. 8. She and others began talking less about Dominion and more about voting machines in general. Dominion would go on to sue Byrne, Giuliani and others for billions of dollars in collective damages, contending that they promoted and in some cases manufactured false claims. The defendants have each denied responsibility or wrongdoing. (Smartmatic USA Corp. also brought defamation suits against Powell, Giuliani and others, all of whom have denied wrongdoing.)\n\nBy the summer of 2021, Hayes and Sanders, the two cybersecurity specialists who had performed the Antrim operation, had become involved in an effort to prove a theory called Hammer and Scorecard. The theory had been making the rounds in conservative circles for more than five years, and Powell had promoted it before the 2020 election. It posited that a supercomputer called Hammer had been developed by the CIA and then commandeered by the Obama administration to spy on Americans, including Trump, Flynn and Powell. Around the time of the election, the theory expanded to suggest that Hammer was using a software called Scorecard to alter results in voting machines and that foreign governments had possibly gotten ahold of it.\n\nPart of the usefulness of Hammer and Scorecard is that built into the theory is an explanation for why it can't be disproven: It is so top secret that the person who could expose the conspiracy can't. That person is a former Department of Defense contractor named Dennis Montgomery. The people promoting the theory claim he can't reveal the evidence because he's under a gag order imposed by the U.S. government.\n\nPhil Waldron, a former Army colonel, a spokesperson for Allied Security and a member of the coalition who worked remotely with those on the plantation, said in an online interview that if the gag order against Montgomery were lifted, \"Specifically what that would reveal is the level of foreign interference in the election.\"\n\nMontgomery has been accused of fraud by former associates, though no criminal charges have resulted from those accusations. In the aftermath of 9/11, he allegedly duped the Department of Defense and other federal agencies out of more than $20 million in part by selling them software that he claimed could unearth messages to terrorist sleeper cells hidden in Al-Jazeera broadcasts. (It does not appear that the government ever attempted to get the money back.) Once those claims collapsed, allies of Montgomery began spreading the idea of Hammer. In 2018, a federal judge in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed a suit Montgomery had filed against FBI Director James B. Comey, which attempted to expose an alleged government spy program, calling it \"a veritable anthology of conspiracy theorists' complaints.\" (Montgomery did not reply to repeated requests for comment, but in the past he has denied the fraud accusations.)\n\nThe person behind the 2021 campaign pushing Hammer and Scorecard was Mike Lindell, the MyPillow magnate who has claimed to have poured about $35 million into efforts to prove the 2020 election was fraudulent. In July 2021, Lindell announced that he had gotten hold of a mysterious set of data that would prove the election was stolen. According to sources and messages reviewed by ProPublica, the data related to Hammer and Scorecard, though Lindell didn't publicly name the theory or refer to Montgomery.\n\nLindell said he would reveal the data at a three-day \"cyber symposium\" he was hosting in August 2021 in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Reporters, cybersecurity experts and elected officials - as well as anyone tuning in online - would finally see the proof that the election was fraudulent. Lindell said that independent cybersecurity experts would vet 37 terabytes of data at the symposium and posted an online offer of a $5 million reward to any attendee who could prove that \"this cyber data is not valid data from the November 2020 election.\" The event, he suggested, would result in Trump being returned to the presidency.\n\nIn the run-up to the symposium, before the independent experts did their analysis, the data was given to a group that included Waldron, Hayes, Sanders and Joshua Merritt, a self-described \"white hat\" hacker - all of whom had been associated with Allied Security at one time or another. (They called themselves the \"Red Team\" but coordinated on a group chat named \"Purple Unicorns.\") Also on the team was Ronald Watkins, who has been identified by two independent forensic linguistic analyses as \"Q,\" the anonymous figure behind the QAnon conspiracy theory. (Watkins has denied on numerous occasions that he is Q; he did not respond to requests for comment.) Private communications reviewed by ProPublica show that he was in contact with people at the plantation in November 2020, advising them on how to set up secure systems to transfer information and helping with research into the Dominion theory.\n\nSoon after arriving at Sioux Falls, it became evident to the Red Team that the data Lindell had provided wasn't what was promised. \"I have checked them all and they are NOT PROOF,\" Watkins wrote in a text message to the rest of the team. \"So there are a few files that could potentially be from hammer/scorecard in there, but that is only because it didn't include a source. Since there is no source, it could be from anywhere - or even fake.\"\n\n\"At the 11th hour, why do we still have zero proof,\" another person on the chat wrote, frustrated that Montgomery hadn't delivered on his guarantees. \"If this software does exist, and the developer\" - Montgomery - \"is working with us, it shouldn't take him 10 months to figure out how to extract data\" that would prove his assertions.\n\nAccording to Merritt, when the Red Team tried to inform Lindell two nights before the symposium was to start that the data contained no proof, the CEO yelled at them that they were wrong.\n\nFor months leading up to the event, conservatives who believed that the 2020 election was stolen had warned Lindell or an attorney working with him that promoting Hammer and Scorecard risked discrediting other efforts to prove the election was rigged. Two people, including election fraud activist Catherine Engelbrecht, the executive director of True the Vote, cautioned that they had had negative experiences with Montgomery and his representatives and that Hammer and Scorecard wasn't credible, according to documents viewed by ProPublica and interviews with people familiar with the matter.\n\nOn the eve of the symposium, the Red Team learned that Montgomery would not be attending; he said he had suffered a stroke. The final proof of election fraud, which he was supposed to deliver last minute, was no longer going to arrive.\n\nThe event drew hundreds of thousands of viewers online, with more than 40 state legislators and others gathering in person. Onstage with Lindell, Waldron explained that the Red Team had looked at the data and \"we've seen plausibility\" and that a separate group of independent analysts would now comb through it.\n\nBy the end of the third day, the independent analysts - longtime election security and computer experts, some skeptical of Lindell's claims and others sympathetic - appeared to have reached a consensus: None of the data contained the proof that Lindell had promised, according to accounts from five of them. In fact, much of the data turned out to be from the Antrim voting machines or harvested from other elections offices and was just a recycling of evidence that had already been discredited.\n\nThe data \"was some gobbledygook,\" said Bill Alderson, a cybersecurity specialist from Texas who had voted for Trump. Merritt told ProPublica that he feared that the hollowness of the data undermined other, more legitimate efforts to prove the election was stolen. Partway through the symposium, The Washington Times quoted him saying that \"we were handed a turd.\"\n\nWaldron and Lindell, however, did not inform the crowd and those online what the analysts had found. On the last day of the conference, Waldron claimed to have \"credible information on a threat in the data streams,\" implying the evidence could have been sabotaged.\n\nThe day after the symposium ended - the day he had suggested that Trump would be returned to office - Lindell dined with the former president at Mar-a-Lago, a photo of which was leaked to Salon . At a rally, not long after, Trump called the symposium \"really amazing,\" and he has continued to praise Lindell's efforts on his behalf. Lindell did not respond to a list of questions from ProPublica and instead wrote, \"The election crime movement started November 3rd when the CCP\" - the Chinese Communist Party - \"and many others did a cyber attack on our election!\"\n\nIn March 2022, ProPublica sent dozens of letters to the individuals named in this article and others that asked about factual problems with the evidence many had put forth as proof that the election was rigged.\n\nSome of the responses were dismissive. \"Stupid article,\" wrote Michael T. Flynn's spokesperson and brother, Joseph J. Flynn. \"No one we care about will read it.\"\n\nOthers contested the article's findings. Russell J. Ramsland wrote, \"So much of this narrative is false or highly misleading that I am not willing to respond point-by-point.\"\n\nDespite repeated requests, others did not respond. They include Sidney Powell, James Penrose, Phil Waldron and Todd Sanders.\n\nSome, like Doug Logan, disputed that they had worked as part of a coalition. Others, however, felt it was an accurate description. \"I was a member of said coalition,\" wrote Seth Keshel.\n\n\"'Coalition' may not be the right word,\" wrote Patrick Byrne, who said that he has spent $12 million on \"election integrity\" efforts through early 2022, often working in close coordination with Flynn. \"We think of it as a network of fellow-travelers who were all volunteering to work to expose what we believed was a rigging of the election on November 3. But I can live with 'coalition.'\" Messages and documents reviewed by ProPublica reveal that the named individuals were in closer contact than has been publicly known, especially in the weeks immediately following the election.\n\nOn the whole, coalition members who responded to ProPublica doubled down on their belief in the stolen election myth. \"I've not wavered on this,\" Keshel emailed ProPublica. \"I can spend hours with you showing you point after point after point to demand full investigation of this.\" The single exception was Conan James Hayes, who wrote to ProPublica: \"I don't believe anything until I have all of the information to analyze, which to this point I do not have. So I can't say either way.\"\n\nOver the course of months, Byrne acted as a champion of sorts for the coalition's ideas, making himself available for numerous interviews and message exchanges. He also sent a 16,000-word letter in response to more than 80 fact-checking questions.\n\nWhen presented with evidence that some of his past claims had proven incorrect, he acknowledged that there were instances when he and his allies had been wrong, especially when they were trying to interpret shifting information in the weeks after the election. He downplayed the weight they had put on claims about Dominion voting machines being exploited by foreign governments, though their own court filings and public statements from the time show this was their major claim. \"I think that it's picking at nits to look back at some of the stuff,\" he said. He defended the coalition, saying, \"I think they got the gestalt of it correct.\"\n\nDon't pay attention, Byrne argued, to the many parts of the Antrim report that a technical expert commissioned by the Michigan secretary of state had debunked. (These errors included Allied Security's central contention that Dominion machines were \"purposefully designed\" to create \"systemic fraud\" through a process known as \"adjudication.\" The machines in question did not have the \"adjudication\" software installed, according to the Michigan analysis.) Instead, Byrne stressed that what was now important was the claim that the voting machines' security logs only went back to the day after the election, making it impossible to rely on any data on them. (The Michigan secretary of state expert found that logs were automatically overwritten to free up memory and that \"the timing appears to be a coincidence,\" though it said that having a limited amount of memory \"is contrary to best practice.\")\n\nDominion voting machines, South Korean jets and Dennis Montgomery, Byrne suggested, weren't central to the case. He repeatedly turned the conversation toward newer arguments for election fraud. He highlighted a March 2021 interim election audit report from a special counsel hired by Republican legislators in Wisconsin. The report's primary claim was that a nonprofit had engaged in \"election bribery\" by providing funds to boost voter turnout in five urban areas, where voters are disproportionately Democratic. The special counsel raised the possibility that the report's findings were serious enough that Biden's victory in the state could be decertified. (A federal judge in October 2020 rejected the argument that the nonprofit's work was illegal, and courts have repeatedly come to the same conclusion .)\n\nRead More\n\nByrne continued to bring up new, supposedly bombshell claims. In his letter to ProPublica, he promoted a forthcoming documentary called \"2000 Mules\" by conservative activist Dinesh D'Souza that alleged that thousands of shadowy operatives filled drop boxes across the nation with ballots marked for Biden. \"Videotapes of drop boxes, cell phone tower pings, and the testimony of a whistleblower,\" Byrne wrote, \"all point to about one million votes being stuffed\" in Georgia.\n\nThere was always another report. Another debunking of the debunking.\n\nByrne acknowledged that no single piece of smoking gun evidence of election fraud had emerged, but he argued that the breadth of evidence that he and those with similar views had assembled made it inconceivable that elections weren't corrupted.\n\nWhat he was doing was necessary to save American democracy, Byrne had concluded. He was sure of it. \"I've got my cards. You got your cards,\" he said. \"I'll go all in.\"\n\nHelp ProPublica Investigate Threats to U.S. Democracy\n\nAs the 2022 midterms approach, ProPublica wants to hear directly from the people involved in the administration of our elections - local clerks, canvassers, poll workers and more - about new challenges on the job.

      "text": "New Details Suggest Senior Trump Aides Knew Jan. 6 Rally Could Get Chaotic\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nOn Dec. 19, President Donald Trump blasted out a tweet to his 88 million followers, inviting supporters to Washington for a \"wild\" protest.\n\nEarlier that week, one of his senior advisers had released a 36-page report alleging significant evidence of election fraud that could reverse Joe Biden's victory. \"A great report,\" Trump wrote. \"Statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 Election. Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!\"\n\nThe tweet worked like a starter's pistol, with two pro-Trump factions competing to take control of the \"big protest.\"\n\nOn one side stood Women for America First, led by Amy Kremer, a Republican operative who helped found the tea party movement. The group initially wanted to hold a kind of extended oral argument, with multiple speakers making their case for how the election had been stolen.\n\nOn the other was Stop the Steal, a new, more radical group that had recruited avowed racists to swell its ranks and wanted the President to share the podium with Alex Jones, the radio host banned from the world's major social media platforms for hate speech, misinformation and glorifying violence. Stop the Steal organizers say their plan was to march on the Capitol and demand that lawmakers give Trump a second term.\n\nProPublica has obtained new details about the Trump White House's knowledge of the gathering storm, after interviewing more than 50 people involved in the events of Jan. 6 and reviewing months of private correspondence. Taken together, these accounts suggest that senior Trump aides had been warned the Jan. 6 events could turn chaotic, with tens of thousands of people potentially overwhelming ill-prepared law enforcement officials.\n\nRather than trying to halt the march, Trump and his allies accommodated its leaders, according to text messages and interviews with Republican operatives and officials.\n\nKatrina Pierson, a former Trump campaign official assigned by the White House to take charge of the rally planning, helped arrange a deal where those organizers deemed too extreme to speak at the Ellipse could do so on the night of Jan. 5. That event ended up including incendiary speeches from Jones and Ali Alexander, the leader of Stop the Steal, who fired up his followers with a chant of \"Victory or death!\"\n\nThe record of what White House officials knew about Jan. 6 and when they knew it remains incomplete. Key officials, including White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, declined to be interviewed for this story.\n\nThe second impeachment of President Trump focused mostly on his public statements, including his Jan. 6 exhortation that the crowd march on the Capitol and \"fight like hell.\" Trump was acquitted by the Senate, and his lawyers insisted that the attack on the Capitol was both regrettable and unforeseeable.\n\nRally organizers interviewed by ProPublica said they did not expect Jan. 6 to culminate with the violent sacking of the Capitol. But they acknowledged they were worried about plans by the Stop the Steal movement to organize an unpermitted march that would reach the steps of the building as Congress gathered to certify the election results.\n\nOne of the Women for America First organizers told ProPublica he and his group felt they needed to urgently warn the White House of the possible danger.\n\n\"A last-minute march, without a permit, without all the metro police that'd usually be there to fortify the perimeter, felt unsafe,\" Dustin Stockton said in a recent interview.\n\n\"And these people aren't there for a fucking flower contest,\" added Jennifer Lynn Lawrence, Stockton's fiancee and co-organizer. \"They're there because they're angry.\"\n\nStockton said he and Kremer initially took their concerns to Pierson. Feeling that they weren't gaining enough traction, Stockton said, he and Kremer agreed to call Meadows directly.\n\nKremer, who has a personal relationship with Meadows dating back to his early days in Congress, said she would handle the matter herself. Soon after, Kremer told Stockton \"the White House would take care of it,\" which he interpreted to mean she had contacted top officials about the march.\n\nKremer denied that she ever spoke with Meadows or any other White House official about her Jan. 6 concerns. \"Also, no one on my team was talking to them that I was aware of,\" she said in an email to ProPublica. Meadows declined to comment on whether he'd been contacted.\n\nA Dec. 27 text from Kremer obtained by ProPublica casts doubt on her assertion. Written at a time when her group was pressing to control the upcoming Jan. 6 rally, it refers to Alexander and Cindy Chafian, an activist who worked closely with Alex Jones. \"The WH and team Trump are aware of the situation with Ali and Cindy,\" Kremer wrote. \"I need to be the one to handle both.\" Kremer did not answer questions from ProPublica about the text.\n\nSo far, congressional and law enforcement reconstructions of Jan. 6 have established failures of preparedness and intelligence sharing by the U.S. Capitol Police, the FBI and the Pentagon, which is responsible for deploying the D.C. National Guard.\n\nBut those reports have not addressed the role of White House officials in the unfolding events and whether officials took appropriate action before or during the rally. Legislation that would have authorized an independent commission to investigate further was quashed by Senate Republicans.\n\nYesterday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced she would create a select committee to investigate Jan. 6 that would not require Republican support. It's not certain whether Meadows and other aides would be willing to testify. Internal White House dealings have historically been subject to claims of \"executive privilege\" by both Democratic and Republican administrations.\n\nOur reporting raises new questions that will not be answered unless Trump insiders tell the story of that day. It remains unclear, for example, precisely what Meadows and other White House officials learned of safety concerns about the march and whether they took those reports seriously.\n\nThe former president has a well-established pattern of bolstering far-right groups while he and his aides attempt to maintain some distance. Following the 2017 \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Trump at first appeared to tacitly support torch-bearing white supremacists, later backing off. And in one presidential debate, he appeared to offer encouragement to the Proud Boys, a group of street brawlers who claim to protect Trump supporters, his statement triggering a dramatic spike in their recruitment. Trump later disavowed his support.\n\nProPublica has learned that White House officials worked behind the scenes to prevent the leaders of the march from appearing on stage and embarrassing the president. But Trump then undid those efforts with his speech, urging the crowd to join the march on the Capitol organized by the very people who had been blocked from speaking.\n\n\"And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore,\" he said.\n\nOn Nov. 5, as Joe Biden began to emerge as the likely winner of the 2020 presidential election, a far-right provocateur named Ali Alexander assembled a loose collection of right-wing activists to help Trump maintain the presidency.\n\nAlexander approached the cause of overturning the election with an almost messianic fervor. In private text messages, he obsessed over gaining attention from Trump and strategized about how to draw large, angry crowds in support of him.\n\nOn Nov. 7, the group held simultaneous protests in all 50 states.\n\nSeven days later, its members traveled to Washington for the Million MAGA March, which drew tens of thousands. The event is now considered by many to be a precursor of Jan. 6.\n\nAlexander united them under the battle cry \"Stop the Steal,\" a phrase originally coined by former Trump adviser Roger Stone, whom Alexander has called a friend. (Stone launched a short-lived organization of the same name in 2016.) To draw such crowds, Alexander made clear Stop the Steal would collaborate with anyone who supported its cause, no matter how extreme their views.\n\n\"We're willing to work with racists,\" he said on one livestream in December. Alexander did not return requests for comment made by email, by voicemail, to his recent attorney or to Stop the Steal PAC's designated agent.\n\nAs he worked to expand his influence, Alexander found a valuable ally in Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist at the helm of the popular far-right website InfoWars. Jones, who first gained notoriety for spreading a lie that the Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax, had once counted more than 2 million YouTube subscribers and 800,000 Twitter followers before being banned from both platforms.\n\nAlexander also collaborated with Nick Fuentes, the 22-year-old leader of the white nationalist \"Groyper\" movement.\n\n\"Thirty percent of that crowd was Alex Jones' crowd,\" Alexander said on another livestream, referring to the Million MAGA March on Nov. 14. \"And there were thousands and thousands of Groypers - America First young white men. ... Even if you thought these were bad people, why can't bad people do good tasks? Why can't bad people fight for their country?\"\n\nAlexander's willingness to work with such people sparked conflict even within his inner circle.\n\n\"Is Nick Fuentes now a prominent figure in Stop the Steal?\" asked Brandon Straka, an openly gay conservative activist, in a November text message, obtained exclusively by ProPublica. \"I find him disgusting,\" Straka said, pointing to Fuentes' vehemently anti-LGBT views.\n\nAlexander saw more people and more power. He wrote that Fuentes was \"very valuable\" at \"putting bodies in places,\" and that both Jones and Fuentes were \"willing to push bodies ... where we point.\"\n\nStraka, Fuentes and Jones did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nRight-wing leaders who had once known each other only peripherally were now feeling a deeper sense of camaraderie. In an interview, Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio described how he felt as he walked alongside Jones through the crowds assembled in Washington on Nov. 14, after Jones had asked the Proud Boys to act as his informal bodyguards.\n\n\"That was the moment we really united everybody under one banner,\" he said. \"That everyone thought, 'Fuck you, this is what we can do.'\" According to Tarrio, the Proud Boys nearly tripled in numbers around this time, bringing in over 20,000 new members. \"November was the seed that sparked that flower on Jan. 6,\" he said.\n\nThe crowds impressed people like Tom Van Flein, chief of staff for Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz. Van Flein told ProPublica he kept in regular contact with Alexander while Gosar led the effort in Congress to shoot down the election certification. \"Ali was very talented and put on some very good rallies on short notice,\" Van Flein said. \"Great turnout.\"\n\nBut as Jan. 6 drew nearer, the Capitol Police became increasingly concerned by the disparate elements that formed the rank and file of the organization.\n\n\"Stop the Steal's propensity to attract white supremacists, militia members, and others who actively promote violence, may lead to a significantly dangerous situation for law enforcement and the general public alike,\" the Capitol Police wrote in a Jan. 3 intelligence assessment.\n\nYet the police force, for all its concern, wound up effectively blindsided by what happened on Jan. 6.\n\nAn intelligence report from that day obtained by ProPublica shows that the Capitol Police expected a handful of rallies on Capitol grounds, the largest of which would be hosted by a group called One Nation Under God.\n\nLaw enforcement anticipated between 50 and 500 people at the gathering, assigning it the lowest possible threat score and predicting a 1% to 5% chance of arrests. The police gave much higher threat scores to two small anti-Trump demonstrations planned elsewhere in the city.\n\nHowever, One Nation Under God was a fake name used to trick the Capitol Police into giving Stop the Steal a permit, according to Stop the Steal organizer Kimberly Fletcher. Fletcher is president of Moms for America, a grassroots organization founded to combat \"radical feminism.\"\n\n\"Everybody was using different names because they didn't want us to be there,\" Fletcher said, adding that Alexander and his allies experimented with a variety of aliases to secure permits for the east front of the Capitol. Laughing, Fletcher recalled how the police repeatedly called her \"trying to find out who was who.\"\n\nA Senate report on security failures during the Capitol riot released earlier this month suggests that at least one Capitol Police intelligence officer had suspicions about this deceptive strategy, but that leadership failed to appreciate it - yet another example of an intelligence breakdown.\n\nOn Dec. 31, the officer sent an email expressing her concerns that the permit requests were \"being used as proxies for Stop the Steal\" and that those requesting permits \"may also be involved with organizations that may be planning trouble\" on Jan. 6.\n\nA Capitol Police spokesperson told ProPublica on April 2, \"Our intelligence suggested one or more groups were affiliated with Stop the Steal,\" after we asked for a copy of the One Nation Under God permit, which they declined to provide.\n\nYet 18 days later, Capitol Police Acting Chief Yogananda Pittman told congressional investigators that she believed the permit requests had been properly vetted and that they were not granted to anyone affiliated with Stop the Steal. Pittman did not respond to ProPublica requests for comment.\n\nLast week, a Capitol Police spokesperson told ProPublica, \"The Department knew that Stop the Steal and One Nation Under God organizers were likely associated,\" but added that the police believed denying a permit based on \"assumed associations\" would be a First Amendment violation. \"The Department did, however, take the likely association into account when making decisions to enhance its security posture.\"\n\nKenneth Harrelson, an Oath Keeper who allegedly ran the far-right group's \"ground team\" in D.C. on Jan. 6, went to Washington to provide security for Alexander, according to Harrelson's wife. Harrelson has pleaded not guilty to felony charges in connection with the riot and is one of the Oath Keepers at the center of a major Department of Justice conspiracy case.\n\nHarrelson's wife, Angel Harrelson, said in an interview with ProPublica that her husband was excited to visit Washington for the first time, especially to provide security for an important person, but that he lost Alexander in the chaos that consumed the Capitol and decided to join the crowd inside.\n\nAs the movement hurtled toward Jan. 6, what started as a loosely united coalition quickly splintered, dividing into two competing groups that vied for power and credit.\n\nOn one side, Alexander and Jones had emerged as a new, more extreme element within the Republican grassroots ecosystem.\n\nTheir chief opposition was the organization Women for America First, helmed by Kremer and other veterans of the tea party movement, itself once viewed as the Republican fringe. Kremer was an early backer of Trump, and her tea party work helped get Mark Meadows elected to the House of Representatives in 2012.\n\nThe schism was rooted in an ideological dispute. Kremer felt Alexander's agenda and tactics were too extreme; Alexander wanted to distinguish Stop the Steal by being more directly confrontational than Kremer's group and the tea party. \"Our movement is masculine in nature,\" he said in a livestream.\n\nTrump promoted both groups' events online at various times.\n\nStop the Steal, through its alias One Nation Under God, obtained a Capitol Police permit to rally on Capitol grounds, while Kremer and Women for America First controlled the National Park Service permit for a large gathering on the White House Ellipse.\n\nAlexander and Jones wanted to speak at the Ellipse rally, but Kremer was opposed. The provocateurs found a powerful ally in Caroline Wren, an elite Republican fundraiser with connections to the Trump family, particularly Donald Trump Jr. and his partner, Kimberly Guilfoyle. Wren had raised money for the Ellipse rally and pushed to get Alexander and Jones on stage, according to six people involved in the Jan. 6 rally and emails reviewed by ProPublica.\n\nPierson, the Trump campaign official, had initially been asked by Wren to help mediate the conflict. But Pierson shared Kremer's concern that Jones and Alexander were too unpredictable. Pierson and Wren declined to comment.\n\nOn Jan. 2, the fighting became so intense that Pierson asked senior White House officials how she should handle the situation, according to a person familiar with White House communications. The officials agreed that Alexander and Jones should not be on the stage and told Pierson to take charge of the event.\n\nThe next morning, Trump announced to the world that he would attend the rally at the Ellipse. \"I will be there. Historic day!\" he tweeted. This came as a surprise to both rally organizers and White House staff, each of whom told ProPublica they hadn't been informed he intended to speak at the rally.\n\nThat same day, a website went live promoting a march on Jan. 6. It instructed demonstrators to meet at the Ellipse, then march to the Capitol at 1 p.m. to \"let the establishment know we will fight back against this fraudulent election. ... The fate of our nation depends on it.\"\n\nAlexander and his allies fired off these instructions across social media.\n\nWhile Kremer and her group had held legally permitted marches at previous D.C. rallies and promoted all their events with the hashtag #marchfortrump, this time their permit specifically barred them from holding an \"organized march.\" Rally organizers were concerned that violating their permit could create a legal liability for themselves and pose significant danger to the public, said Stockton, a political consultant with tea party roots who spent weeks with Kremer as they held rallies across the country in support of the president.\n\nLawrence and Stockton's fellow organizers contacted Pierson to inform her that the march was unpermitted, according to Stockton and three other people familiar with the situation.\n\nWhile ProPublica has independently confirmed that senior White House officials, including Meadows, were involved in the broader effort to limit Alexander's role on Jan. 6, it remains unclear just how far the rally organizers went to warn officials of their specific fears about the march.\n\nAnother source present for communications between Amy Kremer and her daughter and fellow organizer, Kylie Kremer, told ProPublica that on Jan. 3, Kylie Kremer called her mother in desperation about the march.\n\nKylie Kremer asked her mom to escalate the situation to higher levels of the White House, and her mother said she would work on it, according to the source, who could hear the conversation on speakerphone. \"You need to call right now,\" the source remembered the younger Kremer saying.\n\nThe source said that Kylie Kremer suggested Meadows as a person to contact around that time.\n\nThe source said that in a subsequent conversation, Amy Kremer told her daughter she would take the matter to Eric Trump's wife, Lara Trump. The source said that Kremer was in frequent contact with Lara Trump at the time.\n\nStockton said that he was not aware of Kremer talking to the family about Jan. 6, but added that Kremer regularly communicates with the Trump family, including Lara Trump. He also said that Kremer gave him the distinct impression that she had contacted Meadows about the march.\n\nThrough his adviser Ben Williamson, Meadows declined to comment on whether the organizers contacted him regarding the march.\n\nLara Trump, who spoke at the Ellipse on Jan. 6, did not immediately respond to a voicemail and text message asking for comment or to an inquiry left on her website. Eric Trump did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nKremer did not answer questions from ProPublica about communications with Lara Trump. Donald Trump's press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe White House, at the time, was scrambling from one crisis to the next. On Jan. 2, Trump and Meadows called Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Trump pressed Raffensperger to \"find 11,780 votes\" that would swing the state tally his way. On Jan. 3, the president met with Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller and urged him to do what he could to protect Trump's supporters on the 6th.\n\nMeanwhile, Wren, the Republican fundraiser, was continuing to advocate for Jones and Alexander to play a prominent role at the Ellipse rally, according to emails and multiple sources.\n\nA senior White House official suggested to Pierson that she resolve the dispute by going to the president himself, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nOn Jan. 4, Pierson met with Trump in the Oval Office. Trump expressed surprise that other people wanted to speak at the Ellipse at all. His request for the day was simple: He wanted lots of music and to limit the speakers to himself, some family members and a few others, according to the source and emails reviewed by ProPublica. The president asked if there was another venue where people like Alexander and Roger Stone could speak.\n\nPierson assured him there was. She informed the president that there was another rally scheduled the night before the election certification where those who lost their opportunity to speak at the Ellipse could still do so. It was meant as an olive branch extended between the competing factions, according to Stockton and two other sources.\n\nChafian, a reiki practitioner who'd been working closely with Alex Jones, was put in charge of the evening portion of the Jan. 5 event.\n\nThe speakers included Jones, Alexander, Stone, Michael Flynn and Three Percenter militia member Jeremy Liggett, who wore a flak jacket and led a \"Fuck antifa!\" chant. (Liggett is now running for Congress.) Chafian had invited Proud Boy leader Tarrio to speak as well, but Tarrio was arrested the day before on charges that he had brought prohibited gun magazines to Washington and burned a Black Lives Matter banner stolen from a church.\n\nTarrio told ProPublica that he did not know the flag was taken from a church and that the gun magazines were a custom-engraved gift for a friend. He has pleaded not guilty to a misdemeanor charge of property destruction; the gun magazine charge is still pending indictment before a grand jury.\n\n\"Thank you, Proud Boys!\" Chafian shouted at the end of her speech. \"The Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers, the Three Percenters - all of those guys keep you safe.\"\n\nWren, however, would not back down. On the morning of Jan. 6, she arrived at the Ellipse before dawn and began arranging the seats. Jones and Alexander moved toward the front. Organizers were so worried that Jones and Alexander might try to rush the stage that Pierson contacted a senior White House official to see how aggressive she could get in her effort to contain Wren.\n\nAfter discussing several options, the official suggested she call the United States Park Police and have Wren escorted off the premises.\n\nPierson relayed this to Kylie Kremer, who contacted the police. Officers arrived, but ultimately took no action.\n\nBy 9 a.m.,Trump supporters had arrived in droves: nuns and bikers, men in American flag suits, a line of Oath Keepers. Signs welcomed the crowd with the words \"Save America March.\"\n\nKylie Kremer greeted them gleefully. \"What's up, deplorables!\" she said from the stage.\n\nWren escorted Jones and Alexander out of the event early, as they prepared to lead their march on the Capitol.\n\nAt 11:57 a.m, Trump got on stage and, after a rambling speech, gave his now infamous directive. \"You'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong,\" he said. \"I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.\"\n\nLawrence, Dustin Stockton's fiancee and co-organizer, remembers her shock.\n\n\"What the fuck is this motherfucker talking about?\" Lawrence, an ardent Trump supporter, said of the former president.\n\nIn the coming hours, an angry mob would force its way into the building. Protesters smashed windows with riot shields stolen from cops, ransacked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's chambers, and inflicted an estimated $1.5 million of damage. Roughly 140 police officers were injured. One was stabbed with a metal fence stake and another had spinal discs smashed, according to union officials.\n\nThe Stop the Steal group chat shows a reckoning with these events in real time.\n\n\"They stormed the capital,\" wrote Stop the Steal national coordinator Michael Coudrey in a text message at 2:33 p.m. \"Our event is on delay.\"\n\n\"I'm at the Capitol and just joined the breach!!!\" texted Straka, who months earlier had raised concerns about allying with white nationalists. \"I just got gassed! Never felt so fucking alive in my life!!!\"\n\nAlexander and Coudrey advised the group to leave.\n\n\"Everyone get out of there,\" Alexander wrote. \"The FBI is coming hunting.\"\n\nIn the months since, the Department of Justice has charged more than 400 people for their actions at the Capitol, including more than 20 alleged Proud Boys, over a dozen alleged Oath Keepers, and Straka. It's unclear from court records whether Straka has yet entered a plea.\n\nIn emails to ProPublica, Coudrey declined to answer questions about Stop the Steal. \"I just really don't care about politics anymore,\" he said. \"It's boring.\"\n\nRead More\n\nMeadows, now a senior partner at the Conservative Partnership Institute, a think tank in Washington, appeared on Fox News on Jan. 27, delivering one of the first public remarks on the riot from a former Trump White House official. He encouraged the GOP to \"get on\" from Jan. 6 and focus on \"what's important to the American people.\" Neither Meadows nor anyone else who worked in the Trump White House at the time has had to answer questions as part of the various inquiries currently proceeding in Congress.\n\nAlexander has kept a low profile since Jan. 6. But in private, texts show, he has encouraged his allies to prepare for \"civil war.\"\n\n\"Don't denounce anything,\" he messaged his inner circle in January regarding the Capitol riot. \"You don't want to be on the opposite side of freedom fighters in the coming conflict. Veterans will be looking for civilian political leaders.\"\n\nJune 28, 2021: A caption with this story originally misstated the action President Donald Trump took to prevent Roger Stone from serving prison time.

      "text": "Mo Brooks Compared Biden's Election to the Start of the Civil War. Now He Wants a Senate Seat.\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nMo Brooks, the Alabama congressman who is about to launch a campaign for Senate , has officially said he condemns the Capitol riot and opposes violence.\n\nBut in hours of right-wing media interviews before and after the deadly insurrection on Jan. 6, he repeatedly raised the prospect of violence as a possible response to Donald Trump losing the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\"This is pretty much it for our country,\" Brooks said in a December podcast interview that has not been previously reported. \"In my judgment, it rivals the election of 1860,\" he added, referring to the election of Abraham Lincoln, \"and we saw what ensued from that\" -  meaning the Civil War.\n\nBrooks' office didn't respond to requests for comment for this article.\n\nBrooks was outspoken in baselessly accusing Democrats of \"stealing\" the presidential election and seeking ways to keep Donald Trump in power. Now he is hoping those statements will springboard him to higher office in a Senate race that will test the endurance of Trumpism in the Republican Party and show what political consequences lawmakers may face for openly advocating anti-democratic ideas.\n\nThe Alabama congressman is expected tonight to announce his campaign to succeed Sen. Richard Shelby, who is retiring. Brooks is set to make his announcement alongside Stephen Miller, the former White House adviser who drove Trump's hardline immigration policies, including family separation . As an aide to then-Sen. Jeff Sessions, Miller frequently drew from white nationalist and white supremacist websites, according to emails revealed by the Southern Poverty Law Center . Brooks and Miller have been allies since they worked together to defeat a bipartisan immigration compromise in 2013.\n\nPlease join me and @StephenM for a rally and announcement this Monday night in Huntsville! pic.twitter.com/8ZchrGOSwj\n\nHeading to Huntsville, Alabama for a big announcement tonight with @MoBrooks_ . The America First movement is only just beginning.\n\nBrooks' remark about the 1860 election came on an episode of Sean Hannity's podcast that was guest-hosted by Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, and aired on Dec. 22. Though the episode was billed as \"Previewing the Class of 202‪1‬\" in Congress, Gohmert dedicated the entire 99 minutes to promoting conspiracy theories and falsehoods about Joe Biden's victory over Trump in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBrooks joined Gohmert toward the end of the show, along with Reps. Paul Gosar and Andy Biggs of Arizona, all leaders of the plan to object to Congress's certification of Electoral College votes on Jan. 6. The four members of Congress discussed how Trump supporters were mobilizing for a massive demonstration in Washington.\n\n\"On Jan. 6, this is somewhat akin to the Alamo,\" Brooks said, referring to the famous battle in 1836 where Mexican troops wiped out rebelling Texans at a fort in San Antonio. \"Although I hope we will survive.\"\n\nBrooks' invocation of historical violence was a preview of the speech he gave on Jan. 6 at the rally on the Ellipse. Before Trump supporters marched to the Capitol and fought their way inside, Brooks asked if people were ready to lay down their lives for their cause.\n\n\"Our ancestors sacrificed their blood, their sweat, their tears, their fortunes and sometimes their lives to give us, their descendants, an America that is the greatest nation in world history,\" Brooks said. \"So I have a question for you: Are you willing to do the same?\"\n\nAfter the crowd turned violent - leading to five deaths and hundreds of injuries , endangering lawmakers and disrupting the congressional proceedings - Brooks faced blowback. House Democrats introduced a formal censure motion , and billboards in Alabama demanded his resignation.\n\nBrooks defiantly denied any responsibility for the violence on Jan. 6. At the same time, he said he welcomed the criticism because he viewed it as helpful to his political prospects.\n\n\"That's a good thing,\" Brooks said in a Feb. 3 radio interview in response to a question about the billboards. \"I don't want to discourage it, because I think it's beneficial, at least in the state of Alabama, where winning the Republican primary is tantamount to winning the general election.\"\n\nOn Dec. 2, Brooks became the first member of Congress to say he would object to the Electoral College votes from key states that delivered Biden's victory. While the Constitution and federal law do establish a procedure for Congress to certify the Electoral College votes, many of Brooks' fellow Republicans recoiled at the idea of trying to use it to overturn an election whose outcome they didn't like. The certification in Congress is usually an uneventful formality after states have already certified their election results.\n\nBut Brooks himself presented it as a serious plan for keeping Trump in office despite losing the election. \"Ultimately, Congress decides who won the White House, not the courts,\" Brooks said in a Nov. 10 radio interview .\n\nIn dozens of right-wing media interviews between the Nov. 3 election and the Jan. 6 insurrection, Brooks spelled out his idea. If Congress rejected enough Electoral College votes to prevent either candidate from winning a majority, the presidency would be decided by the House of Representatives. The House would vote by state delegations, a majority of which were in Republican hands. All it would take for this plan to work, according to Brooks, was for enough Republicans to join him.\n\n\"In the United States Congress, we control who the president of the United States is,\" Brooks said in an interview with the Epoch Times posted on Nov. 18. \"The House would be in a position to elect a Republican to the White House.\"\n\nGet the latest news from ProPublica every afternoon.\n\nThanks for signing up.

Support independent journalism by donating to ProPublica.\n\nIn Brooks' telling, keeping Trump in power was just a question of political will. \"No question it's an uphill climb, because I'm not sure how many Republicans we have that are willing to do what's necessary,\" he said on Fox News on Dec. 4 . \"You have no idea who's going to win the political fights or any other fight until you fight them.\"\n\nAs precedent, Brooks cited the disputed election of 1876, which Congress resolved by electing Rutherford Hayes in exchange for ending Reconstruction.\n\n\"It was on the heels of hundreds of thousands of Southerners being killed in the war of Northern invasion, as a lot of Southerners viewed it back then,\" Brooks said in a Dec. 17 talk radio interview . \"Hayes cut that deal. Then he was elected president of the United States, and he was honorable, so he kept his promise and he withdrew the Northern forces and Reconstruction ended.\"\n\nBrooks' rhetoric continued to escalate in the runup to Jan. 6. In some interviews, he talked about fighting in terms of voting and pressuring lawmakers, the way that many politicians use the word without meaning literal combat.\n\n\"How it plays out, quite frankly, is dependent on the American people,\" Brooks said on Fox News on Jan. 3. \"To the extent they contact their senators and their congressmen and demand honest and accurate elections, then we're going to win this fight on Jan. 6. But if the American people do not rise up, if they don't contact their senators, if they don't contact their congressmen, demanding that their congressmen and senators do the right thing for our republic, well then, we're not going to win on Jan. 6. So I urge all Americans to participate in this fight on behalf of their country.\"\n\nAt other times, however, Brooks spoke of fighting as armed struggle, foreshadowing his speech at the Ellipse.\n\n\"When it came time to fight in the Revolutionary War, beginning in 1776, people actually put their lives at stake,\" Brooks said in a Newsmax interview aired on Dec. 17. \"All throughout history, American history, there have been time after time where American men and women have stood strong and fought for their country, often losing their lives in order to keep our republic, keep our liberty, keep our freedoms. And the bedrock of all those things are accurate and honest elections. And right now, the socialist Democrats have successfully stolen those from the American people in 2020. And we need to fight and take it back.\"\n\nAll throughout American history, time after time, American men and women have stood strong and fought for their country. That's what we need to do now! pic.twitter.com/xoNvZIXhEr\n\nBrooks indicated in media interviews that he chose his words carefully. \"If I'm on the radio, I know that every word that I say is going to be recorded forever,\" Brooks said in a Jan. 4 radio interview , in the context of defending Trump's pressuring of Georgia officials to reverse that state's election results in a phone call that the president didn't know was being recorded.\n\nBrooks met with Trump at the White House in December, along with Biggs and Gosar, to discuss their plans for Jan. 6. As Brooks recounted in a Dec. 29 Fox News interview , Trump told the representatives that a senator would join their objection, the necessary step for a debate and vote in both chambers. The next day, Dec. 30, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., became the first senator to announce he would object.\n\nBrooks, Biggs and Gosar also, according to \"Stop the Steal\" organizer Ali Alexander, came up with the plan to amass a crowd outside the Capitol on Jan. 6. \"We four schemed up of putting maximum pressure on Congress while they were voting,\" Alexander said in a video that he later deleted, \"so that who we couldn't lobby, we could change the hearts and the minds of Republicans who were in that body, hearing our loud roar from outside.\"\n\nSpokespeople for Brooks and Biggs have denied working with Alexander. Gosar, who appeared at earlier events with Alexander in Arizona, hasn't commented on their relationship. Spokespeople for Biggs and Gosar didn't respond to requests for comment, and Alexander couldn't be reached.\n\nBrooks made clear that his ultimate goal was to keep Trump in office.\n\n\"Kind of like bowling a 300 game or hitting a hole-in-one, that's actually reversing the election fraud effort on the part of the Democrats such that Joe Biden is not sworn in on Jan. 20, Donald Trump is,\" Brooks said in a Jan. 4 Newsmax interview .\n\nOnce rioters breached the Capitol, Brooks immediately blamed left-wing agitators whom he called \"antifa.\" \"You have to ask yourself, who would be motivated to distract from our message,\" Brooks said in a Newsmax interview on the night of Jan. 6, while waiting for the certification proceedings to resume. \"I don't believe that's in the interest of the Trump supporters.\"\n\nBrooks continued this effort to shift blame in a radio interview the next day . \"Too many Trump supporters were angry and allowed themselves to be manipulated or orchestrated by fascist antifa types,\" Brooks said.\n\nThe interviewer, Dale Jackson, pressed Brooks to acknowledge and condemn the violence by Trump supporters. \"Why are you trying to make this about antifa as opposed to about the clear, obvious Trump supporters?\" Jackson asked. \"Why are we trying to diminish this?\"\n\nBrooks shot back, \"That is the political spin that the fake news media and the socialist Democrats are trying to put on this.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not the fake news media, I'm not a socialist Democrat,\" Jackson countered. \"Why don't people just condemn this and stop trying to find reasons why it happened? ... Your Facebook and Twitter page I guarantee is filled up the same way mine is with people talking about this in this way. And I just say we've got to be more forceful, I think. Am I wrong?\"\n\nBrooks didn't answer directly. \"I don't know what's on my Facebook page,\" he said with a laugh. \"That's something that my staff does, not me.\"\n\n\"My point is this,\" Jackson concluded, giving Brooks one last chance to unequivocally condemn the violence by Trump supporters before the interview ended. \"I see too many of them saying, 'Yeah, see, it's antifa, it's not this,' and they're using this as a reason. And I just don't think that's a good - that's not helpful in any way.\"\n\nBrooks demurred. \"Well, I think the main message, which we've diverted from, is the fight we had last night in the House of Representatives and the Senate to try to protect and promote honest and accurate elections,\" he said. \"And it's most unfortunate that whomever was able to divert attention from that, and unfortunate that while we made progress, we did not have ultimate success.\"\n\nIn an interview with ProPublica, Jackson said he understood Brooks to be condemning the violence. \"The only disagreement we were having was whether antifa was a key driver of this thing,\" he said. \"It wasn't whether or not it shouldn't have happened or was wrong. I think we all agree on that.\"\n\nBrooks elaborated on his views on violence in another radio interview on Jan. 7.\n\n\"Might I suggest that over history, when you're in a republic, and there is no longer confidence in the election system, you have three options,\" he said in the interview, which was reported on at the time by The Intercept . \"You can emigrate from that country, which is what a lot of people did in the 1920s and 1930s, in socialist Germany, with Adolf Hitler. You can submit, which is also what a lot of people did in Germany. Or you can resist, often through violence. None of those three options are good.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" the host, Matt Murphy, interrupted. He pressed Brooks to clarify: \"You said we must emigrate, leave?\"\n\n\"No, I'm telling you what has happened historically over time when a republic loses confidence in its election system,\" Brooks said. \"What do people, individual people do?\"\n\nThey continued going back and forth, with Murphy giving Brooks more opportunities to walk back from raising the specter of violence and Brooks sticking to it.\n\nFinally, Murphy tried: \"When you bring up one of your options to be violence, it brings us directly to your words yesterday, Mo. And I'm wondering if you regret saying what you said at the rally yesterday?\"\n\n\"Absolutely not,\" Brooks said.\n\nMurphy, who didn't respond to a subsequent request for comment, then suggested the need to reckon with the ideas that motivated Trump supporters to attack the Capitol. \"We better be willing to have serious discussions about what led to the level of frustration and anger that would cause people to allow their emotions to bubble over to the point that they would engage in something like this,\" he said.\n\nBrooks' response was to explain that people were losing faith in voting - a view he had spent months promoting, and which he said left violence as one of three options. \"It's pretty clear,\" he said, \"people are getting frustrated, and they're losing confidence in the honesty and accuracy of the election system.\"\n\nBrooks also shared a version of this view on Twitter that morning, writing that people who come to believe that voting can no longer get the results they want may be \"FORCED\" to \"fight back with violence.\"\n\n(2/2) 3 bad options: 1. Flee (emigrate). 2. Submit. 3. Fight back with violence. THAT is why we must fight for honest & accurate elections. We don't ever want citizens in America feeling they have been forced into the aforesaid box, with 3 bad options.\"\n\nWeeks later, Brooks distanced himself from the violence of Jan. 6. At a home-state rally on Jan. 23, Brooks defended his speech at the Ellipse by accusing journalists of twisting his words.\n\n\"The news media, which is supposed to be the safeguard of any republic, has to a large degree become nothing more than a socialist propaganda puppet that rivals those in Stalin's Soviet Union, Mao Zedong's Communist China, and socialist Germany's 1920s and 1930s,\" Brooks said, repeating his unusual way of avoiding the term \"Nazis.\" \"The fake news media and the socialists deceitfully suggest I intended to incite a riot when my words prove the exact opposite.\"\n\nBrooks explained that when he said on Jan. 6, \"Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass,\" he was referring to voting in the 2022 and 2024 elections. He said his meaning was clear because as he said those words, he swapped out a camouflage Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus cap for one that read \"Fire Pelosi.\"\n\nRead More\n\n\"How can you misinterpret my intent?\" Brooks said, drawing cheers.\n\nBut what Brooks did not acknowledge or attempt to explain was the next sentence that immediately followed \"kicking ass\": the line asking those assembled whether they were willing to sacrifice \"their blood\" and even \"their lives.\"\n\n\"My answer is yes,\" Brooks said on Jan. 6. \"Louder. Are you willing to do what it takes to fight for America? Louder! Will you fight for America?\"\n\nMollie Simon and Kirsten Berg contributed reporting.\n\nFiled under -\n\nIsaac Arnsdorf was a reporter at ProPublica covering national politics.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "The âunipartyâ is passing Ukraine aid. Can it save Mike Johnsonâs job?\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nMike Johnson might just sew up Ukraine aid and live to tell the tale. For now, at least.\n\nAfter months of holdup, the House on Friday pushed ahead on a package of assistance to Kyiv as well as Israel and Taiwan. The 316-to-94 procedural vote, which drew more Democratic than Republican support, will let the bills reach the floor on Saturday, when theyâre widely expected to win final passage.\n\nIt was the latest instance in which Johnson was forced to lean heavily on Democrats to move major legislation in the face of opposition from GOP hardliners â a growing handful of whom are now threatening his job in retaliation. After Fridayâs vote, Rep. Paul Gosar became the third Republican to sign a motion to vacate Johnson from his speakerâs perch, joining Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie.\n\nGreene, who is spearheading the effort to depose Johnson, but has yet to trigger her motion, told Semafor she was still âworking on more cosponsors.â\n\nBut despite his slim majority, itâs unclear if Johnson faces serious danger, in part because Democrats increasingly appear apt to throw him a lifeline. Officially, party brass are staying mum on the issue. âAt the appropriate time, we will have a conversation about how to deal with any hypothetical motion of the vacate,â Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said at a Friday press conference.\n\nBut members such as Reps. Tom Suozzi and Jared Moskowitz have said theyâd lend their votes to bail out Johnson. Others are making their feelings clear, even without explicit promises. âI think that Speaker Johnson is likely going to be in good shape,â Illinois Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi told Semafor, because Democrats wonât want to punish him for âdoing the right thing.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nIf Johnson does face a challenge and survive, heâll be able to thank the power of transactional politics.\n\nHis predecessor, former speaker Kevin McCarthy, managed to alienate his opposition in all manner of ways. In their view, he helped rehabilitate Trumpâs reputation after January 6, starting with a visit to Mar-a-Lago. After gaining some goodwill by negotiating a bipartisan debt ceiling deal, he quickly backed off the spending numbers and suggested heâd seek deeper cuts. He also infuriated Democrats by greenlighting an impeachment probe into President Biden.\n\nDespite their âtrust issuesâ with McCarthy, many Democrats were still debating whether to save him up until the days before his ouster. But they also wanted specific concessions, possibly including a promise to bring up a vote on Ukraine. As Virginia Rep. Jim McGovern put it : âI am not a cheap date.â\n\nMcCarthy offered nothing, and instead antagonized them by giving a Sunday show interview in which he blamed Democrats for a near government shutdown. Democratic lawmakers watched a clip of that appearance at the meeting where they decided to cut him loose.\n\nJohnson, in contrast, has already given Democrats the single biggest item on their wish list â a Ukraine aid bill largely similar to the one passed by the Senate. Nor has he gone out of his way to antagonize them by attaching poison pill provisions or resorting to partisan chest thumping in the final stretch.\n\nâThe first rule of politics is you first have to ask someone for their vote. And the second is, you got to be prepared for something transactional,â Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips who said heâs âinclinedâ to back Johnson, told Semafor. âMcCarthy didnât just do neither of those. He also berated us. And I think that speaker Johnson has handled himself much more appropriately.â\n\nNot all Democrats think the Ukraine bill alone will be enough to secure their partyâs support, but it has at the very least set the stage for a deal. âIf Speaker Johnson came to see us and wants to have a conversation, there are a number of Democrats, including myself, who are willing to have that conversation,â said Rep. Elissa Slotkin. âIt doesnât happen on its own. Republicans would never save Nancy Pelosi without some sort of deal. But I would be open to it.â\n\nRepublicans are mostly frank that Johnson is now governing in a bipartisan coalition with Democrats, whom he relied on to pass a budget deal and a reauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The partnership has extended to Democrats helping on what were once considered routine partyline procedural votes that the most conservative GOP members have recently used to try and halt legislation.\n\nThe national security package was the culmination of that trend: Democrats took the rare step of helping advance the bills move through the rules committee, before lending 165 yeas to pass Fridayâs rule vote.\n\nFor conservatives, leaning into the coalition has been Johnsonâs chief sin. âItâs the uni-party,â said Arizona Rep. Eli Crane, deploying a phrase popular in conservative media. âI think itâs horrible for the American people.â More mainline members see it as a matter of necessity in the face of right-wing obstinance. âWe donât really have a majority,â Florida Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart told Semafor. âWhat we have is basically the conservative Republican Speaker who has to form coalitions in order to get things done.â\n\nBut relying on Democrats to avoid a motion to vacate may heighten the tension further. South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman told Semafor he opposed the effort to dump Johnson, but suggested turning to Democrats to survive the vote could potentially further damage the speakerâs ability to manage his conference. âTime will tell,â he said.\n\nEven if Democrats can save Johnson temporarily, thereâs no guarantee he could hold on to his speakership beyond this year. House Freedom Caucus Chair Bob Good, who helped knock out McCarthy, told the Washington Post he didnât support a motion to vacate for now, but believed the the speakership should be dealt with after this yearâs elections. The coalition with Democrats, he told the paper, âdoes not reflect the intention or the desire of the American people.â\n\nMorgan Chalfant contributed to this story.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "The staffers who call George Santos âbossâ\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nCongressman George Santos, R-N.Y. is facing ever-louder calls to resign amid a series of pending investigations, but his situation also presents tough choices for the skeleton crew running his Washington office.\n\nStaying on is a daily decision that requires them to weigh loyalty to their boss, service to their district, and the implications for their future employment prospects. And theyâre not likely to get much help from new hires anytime soon.\n\nâItâs just about the constituents of the third congressional district and making sure that theyâre actually being represented in Washington D.C. âÂ whether itâs for federal funding for infrastructure projects down to anything as simple as a flag request,â a Santos aide, who asked for anonymity to speak freely, said in an interview.\n\nSome staffers in Santosâ office already have a history of working with members facing a combination of personal, legal, and political crises.\n\nViswanag âVishâ Burra, the operations manager, worked for Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla. while he was allegedly under investigation for violating sex-trafficking laws â the probe has since reportedly stalled . Burra previously worked for Steve Bannon and helped launch âWar Room.â Sources say he has a natural affinity for controversial figures and relishes the opportunity to work with Santos.\n\nâHe gravitates towards the spotlight as a moth soars towards a flame, unaware that the glamor may burn him,â one source familiar with Burra said.\n\nIn his brief career, Santos staffer Rafaello Carone has worked for former Congressman Madison Cawthorn for 6 months, who was effectively ostracized by leadership after claiming to have been invited to a cocaine orgy with lawmakers. He went on to lose his next primary. After a short stint with Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla. he landed with Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz. for a single month, according to Legistorm. Gosar, a longtime far-right member, was censured and removed from his committees not long after for posting an animated video of himself murdering Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. and McCarthy rebuked him for addressing a white nationalist conference.\n\nOthers have more conventional backgrounds. Press Secretary Gabrielle Lipsky, and Chief of Staff Charley Lovett worked on Santosâ campaign and are new to Washington, D.C. Naysa Woomer, the communications director, returned to the hill after working in Massachusetts politics and government for nearly five years. She previously worked as a scheduler for Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky.\n\nIn this article:\n\nWorking for a scandal-plagued member is not an automatic strike against staffers around Capitol Hill, who often perform critical work on the publicâs behalf while their bosses handle their personal struggles.\n\nBut the story around Santos is different, veteran staffers say. The crisis around him began before he even took office and is so all-encompassing as to make it impossible to realistically do much useful work.\n\nSome have a clear warning: save yourself and get out.\n\nâIf I were the Santos team, I would be running for the exits right now because theyâre not going to be able to put that on their resume,â said Ron Bonjean, a former spokesperson for House and Senate leaders.\n\nWhile aides are not primarily judged by their bossesâ behavior, repeated work with fringe figures can stand out on a resume.\n\nâWhen a staffer works for one controversial member itâs a coincidence, two itâs a trend, and if they work for a third itâs a career,â one former hill staffer told Semafor.\n\nFinding a perfect parallel to Santos is difficult. But staff in former Sen. Larry Craigâs, R-Idaho office started to leave two months after news broke of his arrest for soliciting sex from an undercover cop in an airport bathroom, according to an aide who worked in the office at the time. Craig refused to resign and served out the rest of his term. His longtime chief of staff Michael Ware stayed on and the two later co-founded a consulting firm.\n\nIn situations where a member is becoming politically radioactive, leadership sometimes lends a hand to aides looking to leave.\n\nâThe Chiefs of Staff for the leadership are keeping their ears on the ground and will be willing to help members of his office that are seeking to leave a sinking ship,â Jim Manley, a former leadership spokesperson under Harry Reid, told Semafor.\n\nSome argue that staffers who execute their jobs successfully under pressure without engaging in any wrongdoing themselves could emerge as battle-tested.\n\nâIf you comport yourself with integrity there will be plenty of opportunities,â Risa Heller, a former communications director for Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. who specializes in crisis management, told Semafor.\n\nAbandoning an office in crisis is not always an automatic boost to a resume either.\n\nâLoyalty is a big part of politics and if youâre seen as disloyal that could hurt you,â John Feehery, a former spokesperson for Speaker Hastert, told Semafor.\n\nAn earlier version of this story misstated the state that Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla. represents.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Mike Johnson gets his own Trump bump â but it might be short-lived\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nMike Johnson can actually breathe easy. At least for a few days.\n\nThe speakerâs job looks safer than ever, thanks in large part to Donald Trumpâs vote of confidence in him. But he and the president-elect are about to face a series of unity tests on big votes that risk splintering the GOP â and undercutting their position heading into Trumpâs inauguration.\n\nJohnson has plenty to feel good about after a first year as speaker that saw repeated threats to his gavel and an election where his party barely gained a seat, despite Trumpâs commanding win at the top of the ticket. Hardliners who floated a challenge to Johnson during this weekâs internal House Republican elections ended up abandoning the idea after Trump gave the Louisianan a clear endorsement.\n\nJohnsonâs internal victory was followed by a deal struck between often-warring House GOP factions that will require nine members to force a vote to fire the speaker, a significant change from the one-member threshold of the past two years. Conservatives who consistently lobbed ouster warnings at Johnson and his predecessor sounded ready to give the speaker, and Trump, room to run.\n\nâI want the president â¦ to take the field with the team that he wants on the field,â said Rep. Eli Crane, R-Ariz., who voted to fire former Speaker Kevin McCarthy.\n\nItâs not clear, however, whether hardliners can keep up their newfound interest in common ground as the House heads toward bitter year-end battles over funding the government, passing a defense policy bill and extending federal farm programs. All three issues will require the GOP to maintain near-total unity or rely on Democratic votes that carry a cost.\n\nAnd theyâll be good practice for the narrow majority that Johnson has to operate under next year, a slim margin that has shrunk further for the time being as Trump plucked three sitting Republican members to join his administration.\n\nâThings look pretty good right now, but we have a lot of runway between now and January 3,â Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., told Semafor, referring to the date of the speakership election for the next two-year Congress. Perry, a former chair of the hardliner-heavy Freedom Caucus, pointed to the prospect of a âbig spending packageâ before 2025.\n\nIf itâs any consolation to Johnson, conservatives sound ready to trust Trumpâs read on him even if they have their own doubts. Asked if heâd back Johnson on matters where Trump agrees but the speaker fell short of his own expectations, Rep. Paul Gosar referenced another former speaker mistrusted by some MAGA-friendly Republicans.\n\nâI held my breath and did it for Paul Ryan,â Gosar, R-Ariz., told Semafor.\n\nEven Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., seems resigned to at least two more years of Johnson despite leading an effort to remove him earlier this year.\n\nâHonestly, it doesnât matter whoâs in leadership,â Greene said this week. âThey just have to get President Trumpâs agenda passed.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nJohnsonâs successful week aside, plenty of conservatives are withholding their judgment until early next year. The speaker could find himself reelected on the floor on Jan. 3, only to run smack into dissension from within as the House prepares to organize and start taking up bills.\n\nâUntil we sort out as a conference how weâre going to come together, and make decisions to advance the agenda, then everything remains in question,â Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said this week.\n\nPerry sounded a similar note of caution about putting his full trust in party leaders until the full package of House rules is made official, which will happen next year.\n\nâWe want to be unified, and we want to be focused on, obviously, doing the things we think would need to be done to save our country,â he said. âBut we also know that things donât always go the way theyâre supposed to around here.â\n\nRep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., is another conservative whose approach to Trump and Johnson remains uncertain. Heâs not a member of the Freedom Caucus but joined Greeneâs charge to fire the speaker and is secure enough in his safe seat to be unthreatened by the political fallout that other Republicans experience from crossing the president-elect.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus has made its name by making life difficult for House Republican leaders, but itâs often also assumed to be a Trump-aligned bloc of the party. Thatâs not necessarily true across the board.\n\nIts members often professed to be fully aligned with Trump during his first term, but they stood against him and House Republican leaders in high-stakes talks over how to repeal Obamacare, causing a major internal clash . And just look at where major players in the group landed during this election season.\n\nRoy started out backing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over Trump in the primary, as did then-Freedom Caucus chair Rep. Bob Good (who later lost to a Republican rival marketing himself as more Trump-friendly). Another Freedom Caucus member, Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., backed his home-state colleague Nikki Haley over Trump.\n\nIn addition, the group ejected Greene, one of MAGAâs biggest stars.\n\nThat raises the real question: How independent House Republican hardliners will be next year from their partyâs leaders when Trump is back in power? If conservatives ease up in deference to Trump, expect Johnson to have an easier 2025.\n\nBut if they donât, both the speaker and the president-elect could find their narrow House majority very challenging.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

Read it now .\n\nSpeaker Kevin McCarthy is struggling to round up enough Republican votes to throw Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. off of the House Foreign Affairs Committee âÂ and Democrats are cheering the holdouts on.\n\nâI applaud those Republican members who have already rejected this idea and hope that more will join them to state their opposition so it is not brought to the floor, or vote against it should it be brought to the floor,â Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said in a statement to Semafor. Omar is a deputy chair of the CPC.\n\nRep. Ken Buck, R- Colo. became the latest Republican to publicly oppose removing Omar from her committee, and detailed his position during an interview with âMeet the Pressâ over the weekend. Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind. also previously opposed the idea last week, while Reps. Nancy Mace, R-S.C. and David Valadao, R-Calif. have said they are undecided. Mace told reporters she wasnât going to be a hypocrite now that Republicans are in the majority after she opposed Democrats removing Reps Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. and Paul Gosar, R-ArizÂ  from their committees last Congress.\n\nRepublicans have targeted Omar over comments she made in 2019 about Israel that were widely condemned as antisemitic. She subsequently apologized.\n\nJayapal contrasted Omarâs proposed treatment with that of Gosar and Greene, arguing their removal for threatening violence against colleagues (Gosar posted an animated video in which he murdered New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, Greene discussed executing prominent Democrats on Facebook) was fundamentally different.\n\nâYou cannot remove a Member of Congress from a committee simply because you do not agree with their views,â she said. âThis is both ludicrous and dangerous.Â  In the last Congress, Republican members were moved from committees with a bipartisan vote for endangering the safety of their colleagues. Speaker McCarthy is attempting to take revenge and draw false comparisons.â\n\nRep. Greg Steubeâs unexpected recent accident will keep the Florida Republican from voting indefinitely, which puts McCarthyâs plan in serious jeopardy given the razor thin margins between House Republicans and Democrats.\n\nMcCarthy promised to remove three Democrats from their committee assignments: Omar, as well as Reps. Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell from the Intelligence Committee. McCarthy rejected Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffriesâ appointments of Schiff and Swalwlell to the Intelligence Committee âÂ the nature of the committee allows the speaker to approve appointments.Â  But the House will have to vote to remove Omar.\n\nSo far Republicans havenât announced when they plan to bring a vote to the floor to remove Omar. Itâs a sign of the struggle McCarthy is facing with his slim majority, where even a small handful of members can derail leadershipâs priorities.\n\nRepublicans donât typically take advice from Jayapal and a progressive member highlighting the cracks in the conference could backfire. But Democrats have very little power in the minority and are eager to test McCarthyâs ability to keep his caucus in line, which could come into play on more critical votes further down the line.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nRepublicans voted Thursday to remove Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. from the powerful House Committee on Foreign Affairs after accusing her of antisemitism based on past comments she made about Israel.\n\nThe vote split along party lines. No Republicans voted against the resolution to remove Omar even as some of them suggested they would just days before.\n\nIn this article:\n\nâThis debate today is about who gets to be an American? What opinions do you have to have to be counted as American?â Omar said in a speech before the vote. âI am a Muslim. I am an immigrant. And, interestingly, from Africa. Is anyone surprised that I am a target?â\n\nOmarâs colleagues also gave impassioned speeches in her defense, invoking past controversial remarks made by Republican members of Congress.\n\nâDonât tell me that this is about a condemnation of antisemitic remarks when you have a member of the Republican caucus who has talked about Jewish space lasers,â Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, referring to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greeneâs past comments.

Michael Lawler from New York said Omarâs removal was about âaccountability.â\n\nâThe Congresswoman is being held accountable for her words and her actions,â Lawler said.\n\nIn 2019, Omar suggested Republicansâ support of Israel was reliant on the powerful lobbying group American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). Her comments were condemned by some members of both parties as antisemitic.  Omar later issued a public apology.\n\nIn 2021, Democrats, who were in the majority at the time, took the unprecedented action of removing Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., for inflammatory comments and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., for posting an anime meme that appeared to suggest killing Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nThe majority leader at the time, Kevin McCarthy, vowed that once Republicans were in the majority he would remove Omar, as well as Rep.

Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nRepublican leader Kevin McCarthy failed to obtain enough votes to become Speaker of the House after three ballots, setting up a standoff with his own Republican caucus with no obvious end in sight.\n\nThe House, which eventually adjourned until Wednesday, is essentially paralyzed until the speaker situation is resolved as itâs a prerequisite to setting up rules, assigning members to committees, and voting on legislation.\n\nIn this article:\n\nSome 19 Republicans voted for members other than McCarthy on the first ballot. The vote marked the first time since 1923 that Congress did not elect a speaker on the first try. Republicans won 222 seats in the midterm elections and McCarthy cannot lose more than four votes.\n\nMcCarthy, who faces a rebellion from conservatives suspicious of his commitment to their cause, has vowed to continue holding votes until opposition cracks.\n\nâNo matter how many times it takes, Kevin McCarthy,â Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y. said as she cast her vote.\n\nA second ballot did little to resolve the situation. Conservative Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio gave a speech nominating McCarthy on the House floor minutes before that vote, citing the need to unite against Democratic policies and clamp down on spending.\n\nBut Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla. followed up by nominating Jordan as speaker â and all 19 of the prior anti-McCarthy holdouts proceeded to vote for him.\n\nA third ballot produced the first new vote for the rebels: Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla. who switched to Jordan.\n\nâThe reality is Rep. Kevin McCarthy doesnât have the votes,â Donalds tweeted , adding that the House should recess so members could plan their next steps.\n\nHoldouts are demanding concessions on rules, committee assignments, and policy demands that would give the more influence, which McCarthy allies worry will give the speaker âÂ whoever they are âtoo little flexibility to govern.\n\nâWeâre just not going to allow the tail to wag the dog in this,â Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, a McCarthy backer, said before the vote. âWeâre going to move forward â as many votes as it takes.â\n\nItâs possible that the procedural details matter less than the people involved, though, and that a critical mass of conservatives do not trust McCarthy to lead them and confront President Bidenâs administration, full stop.\n\nâKevin McCarthy is not the right candidate to be Speaker,â Rep. Dan Bishop, R-N.C. said in a statement explaining his vote for Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.\n\nIf it becomes clear McCarthy lacks support, Republicans may be tempted to turn to a backup nominee to unify the party, with Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La. the most frequently discussed option.\n\nSome McCarthy allies have also warned conservatives that they might look across the aisle to find a compromise speaker who could garner Democratic votes, though so far thereâs little sign Democrats are interested in playing ball.\n\nIf any Democrats exit the chamber for a vote, it would lower the threshold for a majority and potentially give McCarthy a path to victory, but members indicated they were in it for the long haul.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. told Semafor that Gaetz and Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz. approached her separately to ask if Democrats were considering leaving to clear the way for McCarthy.\n\nâSome of the Republicans who are holding out were wondering if that was true,â she said. âAnd I said absolutely not.â\n\nGosar, who Democrats stripped of his committee seats in 2021 after he posted an animated video in which he murdered Ocasio-Cortez, did not apologize to her for his behavior in their exchange, she said.\n\nThe House is set to reconvene tomorrow at 12 PM ET.\n\nThereâs little drama on the Democratic side â they voted repeatedly for expected Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries as speaker, the first Black member to lead either party.

      "text": "Behind the mask: Why the new US campus protestors cover their faces\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe first thing you see are the masks âÂ the N-95s, the surgical masks, the patterned cloth masks, the bandanas âÂ which largely vanished from American life over the last two years but are a defining feature of Americaâs swelling left-wing protest culture.\n\nFaculty members at New York University link arms to protect a âGaza solidarity encampment,â most of them wearing face masks. Activists block travel across the Golden Gate Bridge, all of them in masks. Members of the March on DNC 2024 coalition show up to their Chicago press conference in face masks, removing them only when itâs their turn to speak.\n\nNearly one year after the official end of the federal COVID-19 emergency declaration, the regular use of face masks for non-immunocompromised people has faded from American life. Outdoor masking, mandated in many states during the peak of the pandemic, became even rarer after a 2022 CDC advisory scaled it back.\n\nBut that gradual return to barefaced life never reached left-leaning protests, where face masks are widely used and encouraged.\n\nPart of the reason, say organizers, remains an attempt to make a point about exposure to COVID-19 and other health risks, which some in the left-wing protest movements believe remain dire. And part is the threat of a different kind of exposure â from being captured by facial recognition technology or becoming doxxed (their personal information being shared online) by counter-protesters.\n\nâTo us, the optics are communicating that we deny the Biden administrationâs narrative about COVID â that itâs no longer a big deal,â said Olan Mijana, a spokesman for the March on DNC 2024 coalition. âItâs about collective safety, and itâs also about connecting this COVID neglect to the very issues that weâre marching on the DNC for.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe return to masking has confused and irritated critics. âNotice the horde standing behind their masks,â wrote a counter-protester this week, next to footage of his non-masked wife standing walking into a Yale University pro-ceasefire protest.\n\nâNo masks on campus!â said Jonathan Greenblatt, the president of the Anti-Defamation League, in a video posted after he surveyed protests at Columbia University. âThis isnât Fallujah. This is Morningside Heights.â\n\nBefore the pandemic, this level of masking wasnât common â or legal. For more than 150 years, New York prohibited masks in public places; other states adopted similar laws, which made it easier to break up Ku Klux Klan gatherings and aided prosecutors as they built cases.\n\nThirteen years ago, when the NYPD broke up Occupy Wall Street protests, some of the activists there were charged under the anti-mask law. At the start of the Trump presidency, face masks at protests were identified with âblack blocâ tactics that anonymized anarchists; in 2017, some left-wing counter-protesters of the âUnite the Rightâ rally in Charlottesville faced felony charges for violating anti-mask laws.\n\nâYou saw the mentality around masking shift after the street-level clashes around Trumpâs election,â said Sean Summers, a reporter with Unicorn Riot, a nonprofit news organization that tracks the far right. âPeople started to see far right figures coming out with full body armor, and livestreamers working to capture peopleâs identities. In some cases, that translated into people being doxxed.â\n\nAnti-mask laws complicated that response, but many were felled by the pandemic, which also saw millions of Americans become engaged in public protests against police brutality. In May 2020, after New York began mandating face coverings in public places, Attorney Gen. Letitia James convinced the state legislature to repeal it. First Amendment activists took note and began encouraging protesters to use face covering as a defensive measure against unwanted attention, helping to spread the practice beyond the fringes of the left.\n\nâBefore the pandemic, it used to be illegal to protest in masks in many places. You werenât allowed to cover your face,â said RÃ­a Thompson-Washington, a progressive organizer and attorney, in a September 2023 National Lawyers Guild training video . âBeing able to mask is not only a safety consideration, but itâs a consideration to protect your anonymity.â\n\nA college student whoâs spending part of finals week at a Gaza Solidarity camp has never known a world without social media. A senior, who arrived on campus in the fall of 2020, was mandated to wear a mask; the 150-year regime of anti-mask laws died before they got there.\n\nThe anonymity of these protests, and of other pro-Gaza protests around the country, grew out of that reality âÂ and out of the worry that being identified could ruin their lives. Those fears were exacerbated last year after a top law firm rescinded job offers to Ivy League students who signed onto a statement holding Israel âentirely responsibleâ for the 10/7 attack, while other business leaders pledged to do the same.\n\nFear of reprisal has colored the protests, and made them cautious about identifying themselves. Reporters from national news outlets, even friendly ones, have recorded their annoyance at how hard itâs been to get the name and full story of someone participating in direct action. (Students whoâve participated in news stories , like Rep. Ilhan Omarâs daughter, Barnard student Isra Hrisi, are rare and usually have the full support of family members.)\n\nAs these students graduate and become active in politics and government, you can already see the same expectations and norms filtering upward. White House and Capitol Hill staffers organizing against the war have not only worn masks at their protests, but signed onto anonymous letters in support of their cause, annoying older political veterans who argue they should either keep complaints in-house or resign in protest. The semiotics that used to be associated with anarchists, whose masks stood out at rallies, are now popular with activists participating in non-violent civil disobedience.\n\nIn 2017 and 2018, some Republican legislators introduced state and federal legislation to increase penalties on masked protesters. It largely failed, and there is no effort to bring it back yet, but the sentiment is still there.\n\nâMasked protestors undermine their accountability,â Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar, a co-sponsor of the federal Unmask Antifa Act, told Semafor in a statement. When protesters wear masks, he added, it âenables them to commit acts of vandalism, assault and destruction of property without fear of identification or consequences for their illegal and violent behavior.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Principals\n\nIn Davos as in Washington, the conversation is very much about Ukraine â and as Open Society Foundation Board Chair Alexander Soros told me today, what surprises and impresses him is that Ukraine is still above the fold news in America and that the fatigue crowd has not yet prevailed. But heâs also wary of âsingle sentence answersâ that promise a decisive end to global problems like Russiaâs war.\n\nAs Morgan Chalfant reports, UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly was in DC suggesting that the West amp up supplies to help Ukraine win a speedy victory. Those who know Russia and Putin are quietly lurking on the edges of some Davos parties and think that kind of âget it over quickâ thinking will play right into Putinâs hands as heâs willing to play the long game while voters tire of war in democracies. Weâll see.\n\nOn other fronts, Joseph Zeballos-Roig finds anti-tax conservatives at odds over a national âfair taxâ proposed by Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga. thatâs been kicking around the right for decades.\n\nAnd it wouldnât be a new day it seems without another incredible George Santos story â this one on allegations that he scammed money from donors for a veteranâs dying service dog. Benjy Sarlin and Kadia Goba have more.\n\nPLUS: Davos maven and economist Ken Rogoff gives us all a lesson on the debt limit debate and succinctness in One Good Text to Ben Smith.\n\nWas this email forwarded to you? Sign up here!\n\nâ White House: The White House tried to turn the attention back to Kevin McCarthy by demanding he release information about âsecretâ deals brokered with conservative Republicans to get the speakerâs gavel, as White House aides faced an eighth straight day of questions about Bidenâs handling of classified documents.\n\nâ Chuck Schumer: The Senate majority leader sent a warning to Republicans who want to use the debt limit to force spending cuts. âThere should be no political brinkmanship with the debt limit,â Schumer said in a statement, adding that a default on the nationâs debt would âlead to higher costs.â\n\nâ Mitch McConnell: The Senate minority leader said he approved of Attorney General Merrick Garlandâs decision to tap a special counsel to investigate Bidenâs documents, telling local Kentucky radio the current president and former President Trump should be treated â exactly the same way .â\n\nâ Kevin McCarthy: The hard right is ready for its close-up. Several members of the House Freedom Caucus were added to the high-profile House Oversight Committee, including Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar as well as Reps. Lauren Boebert and Scott Perry. Greene also got a spot on the House Homeland Security Committee, which would likely play a role in any effort by House Republicans to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\n\nâ Hakeem Jeffries: The Minority Leader will be watching his state legislature today as they hold a hearing on a controversial judicial nominee Jeffries has said deserves to be treated with the same âdignity, decency and respectâ as any other candidate before the New York state body.\n\nGeorge Santos denied to Semafor an allegation that he promised a disabled veteran to raise $3,000 for a dogâs tumor surgery with a fake charity and then disappeared with the money. Patch.com published allegations late Tuesday, which contained screenshotted Facebook posts and text messages between the veteran Richard Osthoff and Anthony Devolder, another name that Santos went by. A 2016 Twitter post promoting the fundraiser to help âsapphire the Veteran rescue dogâ held âby Anthony Devolderâ was still online as of last night. âFake,â Santos said. âNo clue who he is.â\n\nSantos also received his committee assignment from House leadership on Wednesday. He will serve on the Small Business Committee and Space, Science and Technology Committee. Much of the New York Republican delegation has called on Santos to resign , a push McCarthy has not supported, and itâs unclear if the latest news will affect leadershipâs thinking. McCarthy has previously declared a member of his caucus persona non grata â former Iowa Rep. Steve King â but has not done so in this case.\n\nKyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz. and Joe Manchin, D-W.V. appeared on a panel at Davos where they high-fived each other for preventing Democrats from eliminating the filibuster.\n\nRonna McDaniel told Semafor she has âwell enough support to winâ a fourth and final term as head of the Republican National Committee, which elects its chair later this month. But challenger Harmeet Dhillon thinks grassroots pressure will deliver her an upset. Check out our story about the state of the race, including interviews with both candidates and the RNC members backing them.\n\nâ Morgan Chalfant\n\nPunchbowl News: House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky. is demanding documents from the University of Pennsylvania, including visitor logs of individuals who met with Biden at the Penn Biden Center and a list of any Chinese donors to the center or UPenn beginning in 2017.\n\nPlaybook: How will Democrats and Republicans reach a deal on the debt ceiling when Democrats refuse to concede thereâs even a negotiation to have on the issue? Get ready for one intense game of chicken.\n\nAxios: Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is planning to make a trip to China soon. She just met with her Chinese counterpart in Zurich earlier today.\n\nTHE NEWS\n\nAs part of his deal to become House speaker, Kevin McCarthy reportedly promised his partyâs conservative hardliners a vote on legislation that would scrap the entire American tax code and replace it with a jumbo-sized national sales tax.\n\nThe assurance got relatively little attention at the time, drowned out by the many other concessions McCarthy made to win his gavel. But with Democrats already attacking the proposal, some conservatives see it as a political headache in the making.\n\nâThis is a political gift to Biden and the Democrats,â Grover Norquist, the dean of D.C. anti-tax activists, said in an interview. âI think that this is the first significant problem created for the Republican Party by the 20 people who thought that there was no downside to the approach they took.â\n\nThe idea of a âfair taxâ that would replace our current IRS code with a single sales tax was popularized on conservative talk radio in the late 1990s. It has kicked around Washington ever since, popping up in the occasional presidential platform, but never received a vote.\n\nIts current champion in Congress is Georgia Rep. Earl âBuddyâ Carter, whose Fair Tax Act would swap out the income, payroll, estate, and corporate levies for a 30% national sales tax. It would also send out âprebateâ checks to soften the blow on lower income families, all while abolishing the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nâNobody likes to pay taxes, or at least, I donât know anybody who does,â Carter said in a recent office interview. âBut if they are going to pay a tax, I think they would much rather pay a consumption tax as opposed to an income tax.â\n\nProponents argue the system is superior because it doesnât punish people for making more money and rewards them for thrift, if they so choose.\n\nâIf you donât want to pay a tax, donât buy it. Itâs as simple as that,â the Georgia Republican said.\n\nJOSEPHâS VIEW\n\nCarter told Semafor he didnât want to subject his colleagues to a painful vote. My guess is he wonât have to any time soon: Expect Republicans to bottle up this bill as long as possible.\n\nOutside the deepest trenches of conservatism, a 30 percent sales tax is mostly seen as an obvious political loser. Democrats, for their part, can hardly seem to believe their luck that their opponents might attach themselves to it.\n\nâGreat idea,â Biden deadpanned during a speech Monday . âIt would raise taxes on the middle class by taxing thousands of everyday items from groceries to gas, while cutting taxes for the wealthiest Americans.â\n\nItâs still unclear how many Republicans actually support the Fair Tax Act, or even want it to get a vote. Carter said the billâs debut on the House floor was secured as part of negotiations among 20 conservative holdouts that eventually gave Speaker McCarthy the gavel by a slim margin. But he was uncertain when it would be put to the floor, however, and said he wasnât âprivyâ to those talks.\n\nCritically, Ways and Means GOP members already appear opposed to the plan, at least in its current form. None are co-sponsoring the plan.\n\nâI would almost expect it to be in [Carterâs] interest to pull that bill rather than have a vote on it in committee,â a tax lobbyist in touch with House Ways and Means Republicans told Semafor. âI donât think thereâs any favorable people on the committee with an opinion in support of the Fair Tax.â\n\nThe bill does enjoy a number of co-sponsors within the hardline House Freedom Caucus. But even some archconservatives arenât on board.\n\nâIâve got concerns,â Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas., told Semafor, referring to the amendment authorizing income taxes. âI will not support creating a new tax without repealing the 16th amendment.â\n\nROOM FOR DISAGREEMENT\n\nSome top Republicans are saying thereâs at least a possibility the bill will get a vote. âA lot of people wanted to vote on that for quite a number of years so this might be the Congress when it happens,â Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., a top McCarthy ally, told Semafor last week.\n\nU.K. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly made the rounds in Washington on Tuesday to talk Ukraine , meeting with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, giving remarks at Center for Strategic and International Studies, and even appearing on MSNBCâs â Morning Joe. â\n\nIn a briefing with reporters Tuesday afternoon, Cleverly argued that the U.K. and its allies should take steps to speed up a Ukrainian victory over Russia in order to avoid a âfirst World War type attritional stalemate.â\n\nâAnything we can do to end this quickly has got to be something that we must consider seriously,â he said. âThe sooner we bring that about, the fewer people lose their lives, the less damage theyâll be to Ukraine, the fewer Russian losses there will be.â\n\nCleverlyâs appearance came days after Britain agreed to supply Ukraine with tanks, and as the U.S. and Germany consider doing the same. Cleverly wouldnât offer much of a window into private deliberations, saying only that support for Ukraine looks different from country to country. He also said it would ultimately fall to Ukraine to decide what winning the war looks like, but emphasized that however the conflict ends, Kyiv must âprevail.â\n\nâThere is a broad understanding that we cannot allow the message to be perceived around the world that this kind of violence and this kind of aggression is rewarded,â Cleverly said of Russia.\n\nâ Morgan Chalfant\n\nStories that are being shared less widely across left-leaning or right-leaning outlets, according to data from our partners at Ground News.\n\nWHAT THE LEFT ISNâT READING: Walter Shaub, who was appointed by then-President Obama to serve as director of the Office of Government Ethics, accused Biden of âan inexcusable neglect of the most basic security protocolsâ after Obama-era classified documents were found at his home and former office.\n\nWHAT THE RIGHT ISNâT READING: GOP Reps.

      "text": "Why the White House is going to war on âjunk feesâ\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nWith year three of his presidency under way and a reelection fight looming, Joe Biden has been leaning hard into a promise to combat âjunk feesâ â the inescapable and deeply annoying extra charges Americans now pay to buy concert tickets, check luggage on flights, or book a hotel, among other purchases.\n\nThe issue took center stage during last weekâs State of the Union when the president urged Congress to pass a âjunk fee prevention act,â punctuating his call to action with an unexpectedly impassioned riff on hotel resort charges. âThose fees can cost you up to $90 a night at hotels that arenât even resorts !â he exclaimed.\n\nIn this article:\n\nIt might be tempting to downplay the White Houseâs new big theme as little more than cranky, small-bore populism â like something Andy Rooney might have come up with if heâd ever somehow become president, or an Al Franken joke come to life. (In 1999, the future senator published a goofy novel about winning the White House with a single-issue campaign promising to ban ATM fees).\n\nBut if you talk to Biden administration officials, its origins sound more high-minded. They make the case that junk fees are deeply serious business, a kitchen table issue that also happens to fit snugly with their wider ambition to bring American antitrust enforcement back from the grave and make markets more competitive.\n\nâIt just seemed like a really good combination:Â Easy for people to understand, politically salient, and supportive of our competition agenda,â said Bharat Ramamurti, the deputy director of the National Economic Council, who has helped lead the administrationâs junk fee initiative. (NEC Director Brian Deese has also spearheaded the effort).\n\nThe White House estimates that Americans pay about $64 billion annually in fees, which include penalties for late credit card payments and bank overdrafts, as well as sneaky cable, airline, and hotel charges. Economists argue that these sorts of fees end up warping markets by allowing companies to hide the true cost of their services from shoppers.\n\nTheyâve paid special attention to the ways consumers end up fooled by â drip pricing ,â the maddening practice perfected by airlines, hotels, and ticket vendors where companies advertise one price tag to customers, then jack it up by tacking on a bunch of unavoidable fees (see that massive AirBnb âcleaning feeâ you may have paid recently).\n\nBut other opaque fees can be problematic as well. Early service cancellation charges may lock customers into bad deals that hinder competition. Ticky-tack overdraft fees let banks quietly harvest billions in revenue from poorer customers.\n\nNeale Mahoney, a Stanford economist who joined the administration as a special policy advisor in June, argues that these practices have created a vicious cycle, where businesses must use tactics like drip pricing or risk losing out to competitors who do. âThis practice is becoming more and more pervasive,â Mahoney told Semafor. âWe need to root it out across industries.â\n\nSome countries have already begun the uprooting. Canada, for instance, recently banned drip pricing as a form of unfair competition and started bringing enforcement actions, including against the ticket resale platform StubHub.\n\nThe Biden administration, meanwhile, has started trying to curb some fees without Congress. This month the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau proposed a rule to limit credit card late fees it estimates would save customers $9 billion, while the Department of Transportation is looking to make airlines disclose more of their fees upfront. The Federal Trade Commission is also exploring a broad, Canada-esque ban on various fees as a form of âunfair competition.â But itâs also unclear if such a move would hold up in court .\n\nOne reason Biden officials are interested in pursuing the Junk Fee Prevention Act is that its rules would be less likely to face a lawsuit. But they also think there could be bipartisan appetite in Congress for the proposal, which would ban âexcessiveâ cable and wireless early cancellation fees, bar airlines from charging parents more to sit with their young children, curb fees on event tickets, and make hotels include resort fees in their upfront price.\n\nFor Democrats, it should be a relatively easy sell. Chuck Schumer praised Biden for talking about junk fees last week on MSNBCâs âMorning Joe.â According to multiple sources, his office also discussed the issue with the White House after the State of the Union. Thatâs not a surprise: The Senate Majority leader spent much of his career waging battles on consumer issues like cereal prices and the volume of TV commercials , and is responsible for the â Schumer box â that clearly displays the terms of credit card agreements.\n\nBut Republicans have shown interest in fighting fees too. Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Mo. has co-sponsored a bill banning airlines from charging parents to sit with their kids, while Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz. has introduced legislation requiring hotels to advertise resort fees upfront. Wonky economics arguments aside, nobody likes feeling ripped off while booking a vacation.\n\nCompanies have long argued that breaking the cost of airline tickets and other services into discrete charges gives customers more freedom to only pay for what they need. With Biden looking to curb the practice, the business lobby is accusing him of overreach.\n\nâThis Washington-knows-best approach will raise prices for families, lead to fewer choices for consumers, and make our economy less competitive,â Neil Bradley , chief policy officer at the Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement this month after Biden met with his team of antitrust advisers.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

The ad entitled \"A family defends its honor\" features siblings Tim, Jennifer, Gaston, Joan, Grace and David.\n\nBrill is looking to unseat Gosar, who has represented Arizona's 4th Congressional District since 2013, in the upcoming midterm elections. In his campaign video, siblings of the incumbent representatives reject their brother's far-right political stance on immigration, the environment and health care. Gosar has been supportive of President Donald Trump.\n\n\"We gotta stand up for our good name,\" brother David says in the ad. \"This is not who we are.\"\n\n\"I couldn't be quiet any longer, nor should any of us be,\" sister Grace says.\n\n\"I think my brother has traded a lot of the values we had at our kitchen table,\" sister Joan said.\n\nIn a statement regarding the ad, Dr. Brill said the Gosar siblings have long been on record as critical of their brother Paul, but this is the first time they have endorsed a competing candidate or actively involved themselves in a political campaign.\n\n\"They feel this is a matter of civic duty, making their public statements even more compelling.\" he said.\n\nBrill acknowledged that speaking against their brother was not easy for the Gosar siblings.\n\n\"I greatly appreciate and admire the courage of the Gosar family in stepping into the national spotlight for this vital message,\" he said. \"We all must honor their dedication of working to build a better future for all Americans. This is a commitment I believe in and will fight for.\"\n\nThe six who spoke out are not the Congressman's only siblings. He is one of 10 children and three of his other siblings seemed to have not participated. Congressman Gosar did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nDespite the powerful ad, the odds seem to be in Gosar's favor.

Paul Gosar said he has asked Capitol Police to arrest and deport any undocumented immigrants present at the State of the Union on Tuesday night, after more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers announced they were bringing Dreamers to the speech as their guests.\n\nDemocrats had invited Dreamers in an effort to urge President Trump and Republican lawmakers to find a solution for the undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children. Members of Congress have struggled to agree on an immigration plan in the months since Trump announced he would end the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which protected those young immigrants from deportation.\n\n\"Today, Congressman Paul Gosar contacted the U.S. Capitol Police, as well as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, asking they consider checking identification of all attending the State of the Union address and arresting any illegal aliens in attendance,\" read a tweet from Gosar's official Twitter account Tuesday afternoon, hours before Trump's speech . \"Additionally, Congressman Gosar asked that they arrest those using fraudulent social security numbers and identification to pass through security.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Capitol Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.\n\n\"Of all the places where the Rule of Law needs to be enforced, it should be in the hallowed halls of Congress.

Jeff Flake , who is not seeking reelection in 2018, said in a tweet . \"This is why you got forced out of office,\" Gosar responded .\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told Business Insider that Gosar's comments were \"so outside the circle of respectable behavior for a member of Congress that it's hard to comment on it.\"\n\n\"But a lot of our colleagues are people of faith and profess to believe that all of us have a spark of divinity in us - that we're all children of God,\" she said. \"And for him to make such a statement really dishonors the God who made us.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused Gosar of \"planting seeds of division and fear.\"\n\n\"Dreamers are not a threat; they represent the best of our country, and the majority of Americans and Congress stand behind them,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a tweet . \"Stop planting seeds of division and fear and instead get to work on finding a solution.\"\n\n. @SpeakerRyan - is this what Republicans really stand for? Trying to arrest #DREAMers attending the State of the Union? The American people will not forget this. https://t.co/CjaSZzX8sW\n\nThis is why your party is shrinking. https://t.co/nmVK9ovJ4q\n\nWe will not rest - we will not stop - until we are able to #ProtectDREAMers . They make America more American.\n\nThreatening guests at the #SOTU is aimed at silencing all of us who stand with Dreamers. We won't stand down because their courage far exceeds that of @RepGosar\n\nWrite to Katie Reilly at Katie.Reilly@time.com"

      "text": "Why Rep. Lauren Boebert's Islamophobic Stunts Won't Cost Her Politically\n\nA pparently, the way someone animates violence against a colleague matters more than the fact they're doing it in the first place-at least, if you're a Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nAbout two weeks ago, members of the House censured Rep. Paul Gosar, an Arizona Republican who tweeted an animated video that portrayed him killing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat and progressive star. The video, to every Democrat's mind and to GOP Trump critics Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, crossed a line. Privately, Republicans on the Hill have long considered Gosar a fringe figure whose casual closeness with known white nationalists is embarrassing for the party. Nevertheless, ahead of the censure vote, most Republicans linked arms and defended Gosar, whom they argued with varying enthusiasm and sincerity that he had removed the post and apologized for something done by his staff without his knowledge.\n\nIt was only the seventh such censure in the last 100 years and just the second since 1983. And there doesn't seem to be an eighth in the offing, despite a similar scandal involving Rep. Lauren Boebert that has unfolded this week. Bo ebert is a Colorado Republican and QAnon praiser who successfully primaried a five-term incumbent Rep. Scott Tipton, whom she considered insufficiently loyal to ex-President Donald Trump. As The New York Times sagely observed early in her time on the Hill, Boebert \"represents an incoming faction of the party for whom breaking the rules-and gaining notoriety for doing it-is exactly the point.\"\n\nWell, Boebert has spent this week doubling down on her rhetoric that can only be described as anti-Muslim in describing her Democrat collegage, Rep. Ilhan Omar. Over the Thanksgiving recess, videos from September and Nov. 20 surfaced of Boebert telling audiences that she remarked to a Capitol Police officer that they were probably safe because Omar, who was standing nearby, didn't have a backpack-a crude suggestion that the two-term lawmaker, who came to America in 1995 as a refugee from Somalia, may be a suicide bomber.\n\nLest you think the story is being twisted, let's just include the full quote from last month in Colorado:\n\n\"I was getting into an elevator with one of my staffers. You know, we're leaving the Capitol and we're going back to my office and we get an elevator and I see a Capitol police officer running to the elevator. I see fret all over his face, and he's reaching, and the door's shutting, like I can't open it, like what's happening. I look to my left, and there she is. Ilhan Omar. And I said, 'Well, she doesn't have a backpack, we should be fine.'\"\n\nIt turns out, it's a very similar anecdote to one she told during the Staten Island Conservative Party's dinner in September. She also told that audience that Omar and Rashida Tlaib, another Democrat House member who is also Muslim, are \"black-hearted evil\" who are part of the \"Jihad squad.\"\n\nNaturally, the video sparked a rash of angry calls to Omar's office and death threats to the Minnesota lawmaker. \"We cannot pretend this hate speech from leading politicians doesn't have real consequences,\" Omar told reporters at the Capitol this week before playing one of the death threats from her iPhone. \"You will not be living much longer,\" the caller says in a message that used profanity and suggested she was a \"traitor\" who was due before a military tribunal.\n\nOmar's office has also maintained the incident described by Boebert-when a Capitol Police officer was running in fear-never even happened and has asked her colleagues to take action to hold Boebert responsible.\n\nOmar has long been one of the right-wing's favorite subjects for stereotyped criticism and flat-out smears. One of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress on the same night and the first to wear a hijab on the House floor, Omar a member of the progressive voting bloq in the House known conversationally as The Squad. Her friends like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez occasionally draw the ire of fellow Democrats for some lively language that pushes the party further to the left than they'd like, but Democrats are quick to defend their own.\n\nAs Omar told TIME for a 2019 profile : \"The right wing, Trump, the Republicans, white supremacists [launch] attacks on immigrants, refugees, Black people, women, Muslims.\" In her, she said, \"They have all of that in one box.\"\n\nThere was the social media-fueled story that she married her brother. (Shockingly, a lot of those claims have been scrubbed online, according to her hometown paper's investigation . Equally as shocking, Boebert repeated the claim on the floor of the House as she was defending Gosar from censure.) She is regularly inundated with death threats. Trump went so far as to lean into the anti-Muslim rhetoric to juxtapose Omar speaking in the wake of a shootings at mosques with video of the Twin Towers on Sept. 11, 2001. In response, Pelosi asked Capitol Police to add a detail to keep Omar safe. One New York man has pleaded guilty for threatening to \"put a bullet\" in Omar's skull; a judge sentenced him to more than a year in prison.\n\nNow, before you think Boebert will pay a price for engaging in such blatant Islamophobia, it's important to do a gut check with Republicans' views of Muslims. In 2002, 32% of Republicans agreed with the thesis that Islam encouraged violence. Twenty years later, according to Pew, that number hit 72% among the GOP.\n\nBoebert and like-minded conservative performance artists on the Hill, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Madison Cawthorn and Matt Gaetz, routinely confuse trolling with governing. \"I have built my staff around comms rather than legislation,\" Cawthorn wrote to colleagues in an email obtained by TIME.\n\nMost of their antics are in service of promoting Trump and his return to power. Consider the dress Boebert recently wore to Mar a Lago with the right-wing slogan of \" Let's Go Brandon .\" Or the video Boebert released in the wake of the Jan. 6 insurrection, demanding House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \"tear down this wall\" that went up as a security measure against a sequel to that day's failed insurrection-ending it with a gunshot as the video faded to black. Or when Boebert reportedly threw a mask in the face of a Hill staffer who handed her one so she could comply with mask requirements. (Her staff says she pushed it back across the desk.) This list goes on, because for a certain corner of the GOP, the shredding of civility and comity is integral to what it means to be a loyal Republican.\n\nSo far, no one has actively chased a credible punishment for Boebert in light of her comments about Omar. She apologized \"to anyone in the Muslim community I offended\"-but not to Omar herself.\n\nMinority Leader Kevin McCarthy just wants all of this to go away. He reached out to Majority Leader Steny Hoyer trying to broker some sort of truce to calm tensions, a move Hoyer warned McCarthy would end badly. Still, Boebert reached out to Omar, who hung up on her when Boebert wouldn't express a more public contrition to her directly. Boebert seemed to withdraw her vague apology in a follow-up message : \"I will fearlessly continue to put America first, never sympathizing with terrorists. Unfortunately Ilhan can't say the same thing and our country is worse off for it.\" She then went on Fox News to say she wants to have a debate on the House floor with whether Omar is a terrorist. \"I'm not a terrorist\" is not a statement anyone wants to have to say on the House floor-nor should it be required.\n\nClearly, McCarthy isn't getting his way. Over the weekend, Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina criticized Boebert on CNN, saying, \"I have time after time condemned my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for racist tropes and remarks that I find disgusting and this is no different than any others.\" Boebert's ally Greene responded to Mace by leaning into Boebert's langage: \"just go hang with your real gal pals, the Jihad Squad.\"\n\nThe very small group of Republicans willing to stand up to Trump did their best to plead with their colleagues to be better. McCarthy, for his part, told a closed-door party meeting that-and this is an actual quote-\"I'm not here to be your babysitter\" and said he didn't want to get involved any more.\n\nSo why does it appear Boebert will get a pass, when Gosar didn't? A couple of theories are going around the Hill. For Democrats, the actual depiction of violence in Gosar's video was more than Democrats could stomach. But if they start doling out punishments to every lawmaker servicing Trump's ego, there will be few Republicans left with actual responsibilities at the Capitol. And even those who want to see Boebert rendered powerless or chastened recognize they may actually be protecing Omar better by doing nothing; Omar's criticism of Israel has been seen in some circles as anti-Semitic , and Republicans when they reclaim power could censure Omar for perceived anti-Semitism the way Democrats could punish Boebert now. Why give the GOP a playbook to police this space?\n\nFor Republicans, they're keenly aware that action against one of Trump's favorites is potentially career ending. Just consider this: the day after Gosar's censure, Trump announced his endorsement of Gosar for another term-a finger in the eye of normalcy in D.C.\n\nMcCarthy just wants to trade his current title for one he has unsuccessfully chased before: Speaker. If he appears even the slightest bit at odds with the Trumpists, he can see that hope dashed should Republicans reclaim the majority next year. It's why he backed the Trump-cheered booting of Rep. Liz Cheney from her Leadership post for telling the truth about Jan. 6, an event seemingly so unworthy of investigation that McCarthy's blew up a commission to review it. The D.C. Brief has considered McCarthy's calculation before, and it's a cold one: If the majority is narrow, even a few defections from the likes of Boebert could make the difference.\n\nWhich is why, this week, McCarthy said he would not support a punishment of Boebert: \"After she apologized personally and publicly? I'd vote against it.\" McCarthy is perhaps cartoonishly hoping Boebert remembers the stance when it comes time to pick the next Republican Speaker. He might be wise to remember one of America's enduring illustrated scenes: Lucy pulling away Charlie Brown's football. Violence has many forms of animation.\n\nMake sense of what matters in Washington. Sign up for the daily D.C. Brief newsletter.\n\nWrite to Philip Elliott at philip.elliott@time.com"

      "text": "These Are the 6 House Republicans Who Did Not Vote for Kevin McCarthy to Be Speaker\n\nI f it were a boxing match, it wouldn't have lasted as long. In his bid for the House speakership, it took Republican Kevin McCarthy 15 rounds of voting before he received the backing of a majority of representatives.\n\nThe House cannot tackle any other business until it has a speaker. But until late Friday night, the newly-elected Republican majority remained fractured over the leadership election.\n\nEven after former President Donald Trump urged the party's lawmakers to side with McCarthy, a handful of GOP members delayed the California Republican from clinching the votes necessary to take hold of the chamber's gavel. McCarthy eventually won after four days of stalemate, but not without his reputation getting bruised along the way.\n\nAccording to the House's Office of the Historian , the last time a speaker election required two or more votes on the floor happened in 1923. The 34th Congress had the longest speaker election when Nathaniel P. Banks was elected after two months and 133 ballots.\n\nThroughout the process that started on Tuesday, all 212 Democrats consistently cast their vote for House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries .\n\nAt the beginning , McCarthy had 203 supporters, including himself, of the House's 222 Republican representatives. He didn't have the support of these 19 members:\n\nAndy Biggs, Ariz.-05 Dan Bishop, N.C.-08 Lauren Boebert, Colo.-03 Josh Brecheen, Okla.-02 Michael Cloud, Texas-27 Andrew Clyde, Ga.-09 Eli Crane, Ariz.-02 Matt Gaetz, Fla.-01 Bob Good, Va.-05 Paul Gosar, Ariz.-09 Andy Harris, Md.-01 Anna Paulina Luna, Fla.-13 Mary Miller, Ill.-15 Ralph Norman, S.C.-05 Andy Ogles, Tenn.-05 Scott Perry, Pa.-10 Matt Rosendale, Mont.-02 Chip Roy, Texas-21 Keith Self, Texas-03\n\nMcCarthy's numbers initially got worse over time. By the third round of voting, he'd also lost the support of:\n\nByron Donalds, Fla.-19\n\nBy the eighth round , he'd lost the vote of:\n\nVictoria Spartz, Ind.-05\n\nAnd by the ninth round , McCarthy had also lost the vote of:\n\nKen Buck, Colo.-04\n\nThat was the way it stayed through the end of Thursday. However, when voting resumed on Friday, McCarthy gained some ground, winning the support of several previous detractors . Though it still wasn't enough. As of the 13th ballot , McCarthy had 214 votes, four shy of the threshold. The remaining Republicans who did not vote for him were:\n\nAndy Biggs, Ariz.-05 Lauren Boebert, Colo.-03 Ken Buck, Colo.-04 Eli Crane, Ariz.-02 Matt Gaetz, Fla.-01 Bob Good, Va.-05 Wesley Hunt, Texas-38 Matt Rosendale, Mont.-02\n\nWhen the House returned after a brief adjournment to continue voting late Friday night, McCarthy believed he had done enough to win on the 14th ballot , but he was denied in dramatic fashion by Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz-who, at the end of the roll call, voted \"present.\" Gaetz joined five other Republicans in not voting for McCarthy:\n\nAndy Biggs, Ariz.-05 Lauren Boebert, Colo.-03 Eli Crane, Ariz.-02 Matt Gaetz, Fla.-01 Bob Good, Va.-05 Matt Rosendale, Mont.-02\n\nShoving and shouting ensued on the House floor before an apparent agreement was made that allowed the same six to still withhold their votes but this time McCarthy would come out victorious-though McCarthy may have undermined his own leadership to do so.\n\nOriginally, the holdouts voted for a mix of alternatives, including one of their own Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona as well as founding member of the Freedom Caucus Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Indiana Rep. Jim Banks, and Florida Rep. Byron Donalds.\n\nOver the next two rounds, they coalesced around Jordan, before coalescing around Donalds in the fourth round.\n\nBy Thursday night , the holdouts were split with 12 votes for Donalds, seven for Oklahoma Rep. Kevin Hern, and one (Gaetz) for former President Trump. Anyone in the country can technically be elected speaker, even if they are not a sitting member of the House, though this has never happened.\n\nRep. Victoria Spartz of Indiana voted present in the eighth through 11th rounds, while Colorado's Rep. Ken Buck did not vote in the last five rounds-moves that lower the threshold for a majority . Spartz had told reporters that she maintained her support for McCarthy but that he must ultimately \"address the concerns of other people.\" Buck, meanwhile, told CNN that McCarthy needs to either \"cut a deal\" or \"step aside and give somebody else a chance.\"\n\nMcCarthy resisted calls to withdraw his nomination and worked to negotiate a compromise with the holdouts in his party to break the deadlock. He reportedly offered rules changes that could weaken the influence of the speakership (as well as his hold on the position) and that would empower rank-and-file members.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, in the 12th round , Jordan received four votes, Hern received three, while Buck and Rep.-elect Wesley Hunt of Texas did not vote. And on the next ballot, six Republicans backed Jordan, while Buck and Hunt again did not vote. (Hunt had reportedly flown home to be with his wife and newborn child, but he returned later Friday night to continue supporting McCarthy.)\n\nIn the penultimate roll call, Biggs won two votes, Jordan won two votes, and Boebert and Gaetz each voted present. In the 15th and final round of voting , which took place after midnight, the same six Republican holdouts from the previous round all changed their votes to present, enabling McCarthy to claim the speakership with 216 votes.\n\nBut winning the gavel is just the start. Whether McCarthy can successfully lead such a divided caucus going forward will be the next question.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "The Start of the Jan. 6 Insurrection Inquiry Shows Its Stakes-And Its Shortcoming\n\nW hen police officers put their lives on the line to protect the U.S. Capitol from a violent mob on Jan. 6, most congressional Republicans scrambled to hide from the invaders.\n\nWhen some of those same officers testified Tuesday in front of a House select committee charged with investigating the Capitol attack, most of those Republicans spent the day attempting to downplay the incident, discredit the probe or spin false narratives that Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was somehow responsible for the insurrection.\n\nThe committee's first public hearing was a clear illustration of why the investigation is necessary-and why it may fail to achieve the unifying consensus it seeks.\n\nWhile Republicans deflected, four officers who defended the Capitol during the riot painted a gripping portrait of an all-out physical attack on the seat of American democracy, intended to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power that has defined the republic for more than two centuries. Metropolitan police officer Michael Fanone recounted pleading with a mob that threatened to kill him with his own weapon, yelling that \"I have kids.\" Metropolitan police officer Daniel Hodges said one of the \"terrorists\" had attempted to gouge out his eye. Capitol police officer Harry Dunn said the crowd had chanted the n-word at him, while his colleague Aquilino Gonell said the fighting was worse than anything he'd seen in Iraq.\n\nThroughout the testimony, both the officers and the members of the committee sought to describe their response to the riot as a patriotic duty outside the realm of partisan politics. \"At no point that day did I ever think about the politics of that crowd,\" said Fanone. \"But what did resonate was the fact that thousands of Americans were attacking police officers who were simply there doing their job.\"\n\nBut throughout the hearings, it was impossible to ignore that a number of Republicans were not in the hearing room doing theirs. After Pelosi nixed House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy's selection of two Trump loyalists to the committee, McCarthy pulled the rest and decided to boycott the panel, which the GOP has sought to undermine nearly from the start. Just two Republicans are sitting on the committee, Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger. Both were tapped by Pelosi.\n\nBoth Cheney and Kinzinger gave strong opening statements about the importance of the committee's work. \"Will we preserve the peaceful transition of power, or will be so blinded by partisanship that we throw away the miracle of America?\" asked Cheney, a Wyoming conservative who has emerged as one of the few Republicans willing to acknowledge Trump's lies about the election-and who lost her position in GOP House leadership as a result. \"Do we hate our political adversaries more than we love and our country and revere our Constitution?\"\n\nKinzinger echoed those themes. \"Many in my party have treated this as just another partisan fight. It's toxic and it's a disservice to the officers and their families,\" he said, growing emotional. \"I'm here to investigate Jan. 6 not in spite of my membership in the Republican Party, but because of it. Not to win a political fight, but to learn the facts and defend our democracy.\"\n\nThe insurrection was an act of political violence that grew from the conspiracy theories and lies promoted by the Trump campaign about the election outcome. \"It's not a secret that it was political. They literally were there to 'stop the steal,'\" said Officer Dunn. \"When people say it shouldn't be political, it was, and it is. There's no getting around that.\"\n\n\"Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger are being lauded as courageous heroes,\" Dunn said. \"Why, because they told the truth? Why is telling the truth hard? I guess in this America it is.\"\n\nOutside the room, the GOP was proving Dunn's point. In a press conference organized by GOP House leadership, Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, who replaced Cheney in that role thanks to her embrace of Trump's election fictions, promoted a bizarre claim \"that Nancy Pelosi bears responsibility, as Speaker of the House, for the tragedy that occurred on January 6.\" This is false: the Speaker does not control Capitol security, and it was Trump, not Pelosi, who exhorted the mob to march on the building.\n\nOther Republicans spun different delusions. As the officers testified in Congress, GOP Reps. Matt Gaetz, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Louie Gohmert and Paul Gosar held a competing press conference outside the Justice Department, demanding updates on so-called \"political prisoners\" arrested in the aftermath of the Capitol siege.\n\nIt's all part of a broader Republican lie that the attack was more like a peaceful protest. One House Republican attempted to whitewash the violent insurrection as a \"normal tourist visit,\" while Trump himself told Fox News host Laura Ingraham that the violent insurrectionists were \"zero threat,\" and were \"hugging and kissing the police and the guards, you know?\"\n\nWhich was news to the officers who held the line to protect the lives of these members. \"If that was 'hugs and kisses,' then we should all go to his house and do the same to him,\" said Gonell. \"Instead of sending the military, instead of sending the support or telling his supporters to stop this nonsense, he egged them on to continue fighting,\" he said. \"All of them were telling us, 'Trump sent us.'\"\n\nBut Gonell was speaking to a committee with just two Republicans, both of whom have been ostracized by their peers for acknowledging these facts. And without bipartisan buy-in, it's hard to image that the committee's hearings, no matter how powerful, will result in a sense of shared accountability and national catharsis.\n\n\"Telling the truth shouldn't be hard,\" Officer Dunn said. \"Everything is different, but nothing has changed.\"\n\nWrite to Charlotte Alter at charlotte.alter@time.com"

      "text": "These Are the Republican Detractors Who Just Switched Their Support for Kevin McCarthy\n\nB y the 13th round of votes for House Speaker on Friday, 15 of the 20 Republican members of Congress who had before withheld their support for frontrunner Kevin McCarthy changed their position.\n\nThough McCarthy did not ultimately have the majority of votes needed to become Speaker, the Friday votes are the most progress he has made since votes began on Tuesday. The dramatic week marks the first time in nearly a century that the House has failed to elect a Speaker on the first round of votes.\n\nThe 15 who switched included a mix of some of the most anti-McCarthy members, as well as others who have wavered in their support since voting began on Monday-Victoria Spartz, a Republican from Indiana, for example, essentially opted out of voting during the last eight rounds, but voted for McCarthy during the 12th round. Andy Harris, a Republican from Maryland, voted for an alternative candidate in the 12th round of voting, but then backed McCarthy during the 13th round.\n\nSix Republican holdouts remain, and McCarthy can only afford to lose four votes in his quest for the top spot in the Republican conference if all members vote for a candidate. If at least five of those lawmakers remain steadfast in voting against McCarthy, it could keep the House in limbo , unable to operate without a Speaker.\n\nHere's what to know about the members who have switched their support.\n\nAmong the 15 members-elect who voted for McCarthy on Friday but hadn't the day before were Chip Roy, a Texas Republican, Ralph Norman, a South Carolina Republican, and Scott Perry, a Pennsylvania Republican-each of whom had so far been adamantly opposed to McCarthy's leadership.\n\nPerry, who chairs the House Freedom Caucus, the hardline conservative group leading the charge against McCarthy, on Wednesday nominated a different candidate for Speaker. By Friday, he voted for McCarthy.\n\n\"We're at a turning point. I've negotiated in good faith, with one purpose: to restore the People's House back to its rightful owners,\" Perry said on Twitter . \"The framework for an agreement is in place, so in a good-faith effort, I voted to restore the People's House by voting for... McCarthy.\"\n\nFlorida Republican Byron Donalds also voted for McCarthy on Friday, even though he was nominated for House Speaker himself on Tuesday and garnered 20 votes from the anti-McCarthy outliers.\n\nThe other Republicans who changed their votes to back McCarthy on Friday are: Dan Bishop of North Carolina, Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma, Michael Cloud of Texas, Andrew Clyde of Georgia, Paul Gosar of Arizona, Mary Miller of Illinois, Andy Ogles of Tennessee, Keith Self of Texas, Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, Harris of Maryland, and Spartz of Indiana.\n\nSix Republican representatives-elect, most of whom say they see McCarthy as too moderate, threw their support behind one of two other GOP nominees on Friday.\n\nLauren Boebert , an outspoken McCarthy critic from Colorado, nominated Kevin Hern of Oklahoma. Another Freedom Caucus member, Florida's Matt Gaetz, nominated Jim Jordan of Ohio, who despite being the founder of the Freedom Caucus had pleaded for his voters to support McCarthy during the second round of voting on Tuesday.\n\nVirginia's Bob Good, who denied the results of the 2020 election and received an endorsement from former President Donald Trump, told reporters on Thursday that he was also \"absolutely a no.\"\n\n\"You don't ever have to ask me again if I'm a no,\" Good added. \"I will never vote for Kevin McCarthy.\"\n\nThe other three Representatives-elect who voted against McCarthy in the 13th round of voting were Andy Biggs and Eli Crane of Arizona, and Matt Rosendale of Montana.\n\nThe House will continue to vote on Friday. A Speaker cannot be named until they win a majority of votes, and McCarthy has said he will continue to negotiate with the most hardline Republicans in the conference until that happens.\n\nIf every House member votes for a candidate, McCarthy can only afford to lose four Republicans overall. Alternatively, if enough members don't vote or only mark themselves as present, then McCarthy could become Speaker as long as he gets more votes than the Democratic nominee, Hakeem Jeffries of New York .\n\nMcCarthy has already offered several concessions to the holdouts that stand to reshape Congress, including giving members the power to call for a vote to oust the speaker at any time, and giving some of the most hardline Republican members seats on influential committees and subcommittees.\n\nWrite to Jasmine Aguilera at jasmine.aguilera@time.com and Julia Zorthian at julia.zorthian@time.com"

Matt Gaetz of Florida, Paul Gosar of Arizona, Andy Biggs of Arizona, Louie Gohmert of Texas, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.\n\nPreviously, the committee had only named Perry as one of the members of Congress who had sought a pardon. Most of the lawmakers attended a Dec. 21, 2020, meeting at the White House where they discussed last-ditch plans to block the transfer of power to Biden, including objecting to the electoral votes of decisive states Biden won during the congressional certification of the Electoral College on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n\"The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you've committed a crime,\" said Rep. Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois and a member of the Jan. 6 panel, who led questioning on Thursday.\n\nWhile no such pardons were ever revealed, it's not clear whether Trump may have granted any of the lawmakers clemency in secret . Former U.S. Pardon Attorney Margaret Love told TIME the president could have issued pardons to members of Congress without ever publicizing them or even notifying the Justice Department.\n\nMuch of the hearing centered on former Justice Department lawyer Jeffrey Clark, whose efforts to exploit the nation's top law enforcement agency to push baseless conspiracy theories about election fraud quickly brought him to Trump's attention. In December 2020, Trump and Clark pushed for the DOJ to send Georgia election officials a letter that falsely said the department had \"identified significant concerns\" that would throw the state's election results into doubt.\n\nAfter Donoghue and other high-ranking officials resisted Trump's pressure, the former president and several Republican members of Congress mobilized a campaign to replace the current acting attorney general at the time, Jeff Rosen, with Clark. They argued that promoting Clark would ensure that the Justice Department would use its authority to question the election outcome. Trump's plan to install Clark in that role came close enough to fruition that by Jan. 3, 2021, the White House was already referring to him by that title, according to evidence the committee presented.\n\nWhen asked why Trump wanted Clark, Rudy Guiliani, Trump's personal lawyer, told committee investigators during a taped deposition that the thinking was \"someone should be put in charge of the Justice Department who isn't going to be frightened of what's going to be done to their reputation\" by working to toss out the election outcome.\n\nThe only reason Clark wasn't ultimately promoted was because several of the Justice Department's top officials vowed to resign, according to testimony on Thursday from Donoghue, Rosen, and former Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel Steven Engel. \"People tell me I should just get rid of both of you and make a change of leadership,\" Donoghue recalled Trump saying to them. \"Put Jeff Clark in and something will finally get done.\"\n\nDonoghue said he responded by telling the president, \"Every single acting AG will walk out.\"\n\nOn that same day, Engel said he had a three-hour meeting with Trump in which he told the President it would be wrong to fire Rosen for being unwilling to lie to the American people about voter fraud in the 2020 election.\n\nAll of the witnesses who testified Thursday expressed grave concerns over Trump's frequent communications with Clark throughout December 2020 and January 2021. Clark's main focus at the DOJ was on the environment; he had no experience with election litigation. \"How does the president even know Mr. Clark?\" Rosen recalled wondering.\n\n\"You're an environmental lawyer,\" Donoghue said he told Clark at one point. \"How about you go back to your office, and we'll call you when there's an oil spill.\"\n\nOther White House officials testified that they were alarmed by Clark's scheme to capitalize on the Justice Department's credibility to overturn an election.\n\n\"When he finished discussing what he planned on doing, I said, 'Good, f-cking a-hole, congratulations, you just admitted your first step or act you would take as attorney general would be committing a felony,'\" Herschmann said he told Clark, according to taped testimony aired on Thursday. \"The only thing you know about environmental and election challenges is that they both start with E,\" he went on. \"And I'm not even sure you know that.\"\n\nThe committee also presented video evidence to demonstrate how Trump and Republican lawmakers whipped up their supporters against the Justice Department, falsely claiming that the department was refusing to investigate voter fraud. In an interview, Fox Business anchor Maria Bartiromo asked Trump why the DOJ wasn't doing anything about his spurious claims of voter fraud. \"Missing in action,\" he said. Gaetz likewise eviscerated the agency at a conservative conference in December. And on the morning of Jan. 6, Capitol rioters showed up outside the Department of Justice building in Washington chanting, \"Do your job!\"\n\nMembers of the panel lauded the witnesses for standing up to Trump and for refusing to cede to the pressure campaign. Kinzinger asked Americans to consider what would have befell the country if people with less integrity were in their positions at the time.\n\n\"Imagine a future where the president could screen applicants to the Justice Department with one question: Are you loyal to me or to the Constitution?\" Kinzinger said. \"It wouldn't take long to find people willing to pledge their loyalty to the man.\"\n\nThe next hearing had been previously slated for Monday but the committee announced this week it was pushing back the remaining hearings to July as it gathers new information and decides how to factor it into its final proceedings.\n\nThough the committee had initially planned six hearings, multiple sources told TIME the panel is already planning to hold at least one more additional hearing before issuing its final report. Rep. Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, said that the televised hearings have inspired more people to come forward.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming and vice chair of the committee, echoed the same sentiment on Thursday. \"There is much more evidence to come,\" she said.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "The Strange Coalition in Congress Poised to Score a Major Win Against Big Tech\n\nC ongress doesn't get much done these days, but one major piece of legislation stands a good chance of becoming law thanks to a bizarre coalition that includes virtually every Democrat not from California and some of the most conservative members of the GOP caucus.\n\nThe bill, called the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, or AICO, aims to curb Big Tech's monopoly power. Supporters say it will prevent the likes of Amazon and Google from giving an advantage to their own products over competitors on their platforms. The tech giants argue the bill will stifle innovation, harm consumers, and jeopardize cybersecurity.\n\nNonetheless, AICO is on the verge of passing both chambers in the coming weeks, with the support of progressives like Reps. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, Jamie Raskin of Maryland, and David Cicilline of Rhode Island, who authored the House version, as well as MAGA Republicans like Reps. Paul Gosar of Arizona and Matt Gaetz of Florida. Even Tucker Carlson, the far-right Fox News host with the most-watched cable news show, has devoted segments to the bill's merits.\n\nAs efforts to revive a slimmed-down version of President Joe Biden's Build Back Better agenda have stalled and the latest round of bipartisan negotiations on gun control may be months away from bearing fruit, if they do at all, AICO might be the only substantial action Congress takes before pivoting to the midterms.\n\n\"This is the show,\" says a senior House Democratic staffer not authorized to speak publicly on the bill.\n\nThe legislation has already cleared the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, meaning it is ready to be voted on by the full chambers. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has committed to putting AICO up for a floor vote by early summer, Axios reported last week. And a Congressional aide familiar with the matter tells TIME the bill has the votes to pass the House once it makes it out of the Senate.\n\nMultiple sources involved in the process say that Speaker Nancy Pelosi is waiting for the measure to clear the Senate before putting it on the House floor.\n\nIn the House, where Democrats have a 13-seat majority, no more than eight Democrats are expected to vote against the measure, half of whom are a hard no, while the rest remain undecided, according to the latest whip count. But with nine Republican co-sponsors, including members of the Freedom Caucus such as Reps. Ken Buck of Colorado and Lance Gooden of Texas, the bill should still have more than enough support to make it over the finish line.\n\nThe rare showing of bipartisanship that may send AICO to Biden, who is expected to sign it, reflects the intense interest on Capitol Hill to take on the tech behemoths, who have antagonized different factions of Congress for different reasons, inadvertently creating this strange-bedfellows alliance.\n\nDemocrats, to varying degrees, see an imperative to address dangerous levels of concentrated economic power. Republicans are eager to crack down on dominant communications platforms run and staffed largely by liberals, whom they accuse of intentionally stifling conservative speech.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, and Sen. Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa, agree on hardly anything. But the respective Senate Antitrust Subcommittee chairwoman and the Senate Judiciary Committee ranking member agree on the need to stop powerhouse platforms like Amazon and Google from abusing their gatekeeper status. Together, they introduced AICO last year and have since attracted a motley crew of Senate co-sponsors ranging from liberal favorite Cory Booker of New Jersey to right-wing firebrand Josh Hawley of Missouri.\n\nA second tech bill, the Open App Markets Act, is also moving through Congress, and would force Apple and Google to open their app stores to rival marketplaces. It passed the Senate Judiciary Committee by a bipartisan vote of 20-2. Both chambers are expected to pass the legislation in conjunction with AICO.\n\nBut while the measures have broad support, time is not on their side. If AICO doesn't pass before Congress breaks for its five-week summer recess in early August, there's little hope it can get done in the fall, when all eyes will turn toward the midterms. \"There's going to be a lot of things that come up after August,\" Buck tells TIME. \"It will be more difficult to get these passed.\"\n\nAnd if Republicans have a good enough election outcome to take back control of one or both chambers of Congress, as many expect, the entire effort could be squashed. One of the bill's biggest opponents on Capitol Hill is Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California who is the frontrunner to be the next Speaker if the GOP takes back the House.\n\nGarrett Ventry, Buck's former former chief of staff who is now a Republican consultant and lobbyist, notes that a multimillion-dollar effort by the major tech firms has failed every step of the way in blocking either bill from advancing. \"They tried to stop the bills from even getting introduced. They tried to stop the bills from getting through committee. Now they are trying to stop the bills from getting passed out of Congress.\"\n\n\"But the votes are there, so the only way they can win is if they run out the clock,\" Ventry adds.\n\nIn other words, the race is on. Klobuchar recently released an updated version of AICO after getting input from on-the-fence lawmakers. The changes include more permissive language that allows platforms to engage in certain kinds of anti-competitive conduct to protect users' privacy. The text also prohibits platforms from denying competitors access to their software systems, known as interoperability. Klobuchar's communications director, Jane Meyer, tells TIME the Minnesota lawmaker is \"working expeditiously with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to bring this bill to the floor.\"\n\nThe National Taxpayers Union, an advocacy group that has received support from tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook, argued last week that Kloubuchar's update did not address the bill's biggest flaws.\n\n\"AICO isn't going to help consumers. It's a big government bill aimed at empowering bureaucrats in Washington to exercise greater control over technology companies,\" says Will Yepez, the group's policy and government affairs manager. \"Lawmakers who want to do something about Big Tech can do that without taking heavy-handed action.\"\n\nFor the chief advocates of the legislation, the primary hurdle is to simply get the bills on the floor for a vote. \"These bills have never been about whip count, because it's always been pretty clear that if you hold a vote, they will pass,\" says a former Senate aide now lobbying for the legislation. \"People don't want to stand with Big Tech.\"\n\nNumerous polls have found that most Americans approve of legislation to rein in the power of the tech giants. A July 2021 survey by the Future of Tech Commission found that 80 percent of registered voters want the federal government to \"curb the influence of Big Tech companies.\" A new poll this month by Hart Research found that 76% of voters in swing states such as Arizona, Georgia, New Hampshire, and Nevada support AICO after being told what the bill intends to do.\n\nStill, Pelosi wants to see AICO pass the evenly split Senate-where so many Democratic priorities die-before putting her members through a vote that might draw pushback from some of their constituents. She is mainly thinking of her fellow California Democrats, many of whom represent Silicon Valley.\n\nUntil then, AICO has to make it through a short time window when members of Congress will be trying to ram through other legislation before campaign season ramps up.\n\nSome legislators want to prioritize measures that they feel would resonate more with voters, such as a bill to provide funding to ease the pandemic-caused supply-chain crisis that has already passed the Senate, and a heavily watered down-version of Biden's sweeping Build Back Better framework that might draw the pivotal support of Sen. Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia. At the same time, there's a renewed interest in passing new red flag laws and expanding background checks after recent mass shootings in Buffalo, N.Y., and Uvalde, Texas.\n\nThe challenge for AICO's supporters, sources say, will be to finagle the bill through a busy summer docket-especially as the Big Tech lobbying firms intensify their effort to thwart it.\n\n\"Anytime you have a bill that brings together not your average combination of members, it's always tricky to figure out how it's going to happen,\" a senior Democratic Senate aide says. \"You don't know what's going to happen-until it's happening.\"\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Rep. Paul Gosar says he is running for 8th House term to fight for Trump agenda\n\nRep. Paul Gosar is seeking an eighth term in Congress, saying at a campaign kickoff event he's \"bullish\" that Republicans can keep control of the House next year and enact President Donald Trump's agenda.\n\n\"I want to start this fever, and that's why I'm here,\" Gosar, R-Ariz., said Thursday in an interview after he made his reelection bid official. \"Trump has given us the blueprint, and now the fight is in Congress.\"\n\nGosar, 66, is running for reelection to represent Arizona's deep-red 9th Congressional District, which encompasses all of La Paz County, most of Mohave and Yuma counties and the western part of Maricopa County.\n\nIt's the most conservative district in Arizona; Gosar was reelected with 65% of the vote in November.\n\n\"No Republican wants to run against him,\" said Dean Owens, 67, who lives in Verrado, an upscale master-planned community in Buckeye. \"Because they think he's doing the best job.\"\n\nGosar delivered a short speech to a crowd of about 50 people at the Verrado Republican Club in Buckeye. He said he was getting in the 2026 race early to help Trump.\n\nAlthough the party that controls the White House typically faces challenges in a midterm election, Gosar said he is confident Republicans can hang onto their narrow control of the House. Right now, the GOP has a trifecta of control across the White House, the Senate and the House in Washington, D.C.\n\nIf Democrats do take the House next fall, Republicans will have a harder time turning Trump's policies into law.\n\n\"The deep state is working tirelessly against President Trump and the Republicans in Congress, and that's why I announced my reelection now. Like you, I will never retreat. I will never surrender my conservative principles,\" Gosar said, delivering his speech while standing beside his son. \"I will fight alongside President Trump in Washington, D.C., to take back our country.\"\n\nGosar, a Bullhead City Republican and a dentist, is a staunch Trump ally who has served on Capitol Hill since 2011.\n\nGosar has come under fire over the years for embracing the far right and using white nationalist rhetoric about immigration. In 2021, he was censured in the House for sharing an anime video depicting him killing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and attacking then-President Joe Biden.\n\nGosar was joined by Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., who he endorsed in the Arizona GOP primary for governor against businesswoman Karrin Taylor Robson. Rep. Eli Crane, R-Ariz., was also scheduled to speak but did not attend the event.\n\nBiggs praised Gosar as the \"conscience\" of Congress.\n\n\"I know nobody else who is more honest, more hardworking, more diligent, better suited to represent Congress in an era where we look at Congress most of the time and say it's irredeemable. Paul Gosar provides the conscience for the United States Congress,\" Biggs said.\n\nGosar returned the favor in an interview after the event, casting doubt on whether a pre-endorsement that Trump gave Taylor Robson will hold now that Biggs is running for governor against her.\n\nTrump encouraged Taylor Robson to launch a campaign in December when he was in Phoenix for a speech, saying that she'd have his support if she did.\n\n\"I don't think he endorsed her,\" Gosar said, adding that Trump may dislike negative comments that Taylor Robson made about him in the past. \"Speech is a nasty thing coming back around.\"\n\nGosar said he hasn't \"yet\" spoken to Trump about the governor's race, but is in touch with his advisers.\n\nGosar's supporters echoed his excitement about Trump returning to the White House after his 2020 election defeat. When an opening prayer mentioned Trump had returned to Washington, the crowd said \"amen.\"\n\n\"I'm so thankful that Trump is in,\" said Peggy Pautsch, 70, a retiree who splits her time between Goodyear and Iowa. \"One of the things that I like about him the most is that he stays true to his promises. I am so tired of politicians who talk out of both sides of their mouth or just vote the way the wind is blowing.\"\n\nPautsch's husband, Republican David Pautsch, plans to challenge Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, to a GOP primary rematch in 2026.\n\nPautsch said she's particularly troubled by excess government spending and is happy to see Trump addressing it. The president signed executive orders in his first month to dramatically shrink the federal workforce and pause federal grants, though his grant order is caught up in court.\n\nGosar, too, praised Trump's push to reduce the federal workforce and said he does not believe recent layoffs at the Social Security Administration will impact services for his constituents.\n\n\"Everything's got fraud, and we got to get better at how we take care of this,\" Gosar said. \"That's why I applaud.\""

Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to remove House Speaker Mike Johnson's gavel because he advanced foreign-aid legislation.\n\nThe $95 billion foreign aid package provides funding to U.S. allies - Ukraine and Israel - in their ongoing conflicts and Taiwan. With foreign funding unpopular with some Republican members of the House, Johnson, R-La., relied on House Democrats to get the legislation passed.\n\nThe bill passed 316 to 94 with 165 Democrats voting for the legislation. The Republican House majority had 151 members vote in favor.\n\nThis decision may lead to Johnson's downfall as speaker of the House of Representatives as Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who was ousted from the position last year, was voted out of his position after a similar reliance on Democrats to pass crucial legislation.\n\nGosar, R-Ariz., joined Greene, R-Ga., who last month introduced the motion to vacate Johnson, and Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky.\n\nGosar cited the border crisis as his reason for joining the motion.\n\n\"Despite repeated promises there would be no additional money going to Ukraine without first securing our border, the House ... is on the verge of sending another $61 billion to further draw America into an endless and purposeless war in Ukraine,\" Gosar said Friday in a written statement.\n\nGosar said his district is \"ground zero for the invasion\" of illegal immigrants and argued that funds set for Ukraine in this legislation should be going toward securing the southern border. While Gosar's district, Arizona's 9th Congressional District, does not touch the southern border, it is very close to it, covering areas of Yuma.\n\n\"I have added my name in support of the motion to vacate the Speaker,\" Gosar added. \"Our border cannot be an afterthought.\"\n\nGreene thanked Gosar for his action to join the motion on X, formally known as Twitter. \"And now there are three,\" she said.\n\nWhile Gosar was not one of the eight House Republicans who voted to oust McCarthy in October 2023, two Arizona Republicans were: Reps. Andy Biggs and Eli Crane.\n\nBoth Biggs and Crane expressed their disappointment with the passing of Johnson's foreign-aid package. Crane called the legislation a part of the \"American Last Agenda\" on X on Friday. Biggs reiterated Crane's message, saying on X that \"Johnson's coalition government now relies on Democrats to prop up America Last legislation in a supposedly Republican-controlled House.\"\n\nJohnson's bill is expected to win final House approval this weekend, before going to the Democratic-controlled Senate, where it is likely to pass.\n\nReach reporter Morgan Fischer at morgan.fischer@gannett.com or on X, formally known as Twitter, @morgfisch ."

      "text": "Rep. Paul Gosar targets Joint Chiefs of Staff chair as 'traitor,' vows investigation\n\nU.S. Rep. Paul Gosar is zeroing in on Gen. Mark Milley, calling the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff a \"traitor\" and signaling that an investigation is coming.\n\nOn Twitter, Gosar, R-Ariz., this month wrote that the new Republican-controlled House of Representatives will conduct \"a real investigation\" into the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot and \"the effort to attempt a coup between traitor Gen. Mark Milley and (then-House Speaker Nancy) Pelosi will be reviewed and exposed.\"\n\nIt might not be an idle threat. New House rules passed Jan. 10 may set up a situation in which Gosar and other members of Congress who came under scrutiny for their roles in the lead-up to the Jan. 6 riot may get the opportunity to act as investigators.\n\nGosar has been a veteran member of the investigative House Committee on Oversight and Accountability. His Twitter message about Milley, the highest-ranking officer in the U.S. military, and Pelosi, D-Calif., was in response to comedian and broadcaster John Fugelsang's tweet, which said: \"Remember - (new House Speaker) Kevin McCarthy, (and Reps.) Matt Gaetz, Lauren Boebert & Paul Gosar all share the same pre-existing sedition. #January6th.\"\n\nOther new House rules include: the weakening of the House Ethics Committee, creating the \"weaponization of the federal government\" subcommittee and ending the prior Jan 6. subcommittee created when the Democrats held the House majority.\n\nGosar followed up his initial comments with an explanatory post : \"Milleys treasonous sell out to China will be investigated. Pelosi not warning members about intel of impending violence will be exposed. Soon, we'll know the truth.\"\n\nGosar's remarks on Milley stem from revelations first published in Bob Woodward and Robert Costa's book \"Peril\" and echo former President Donald Trump's reaction. As chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Milley called his Chinese equivalent, called Gen. Li Zuocheng, twice to prevent a possible violent conflict.\n\nMilley's first phone call to Li took place on Oct. 30, 2020, in which he reassured China that the U.S. had no intentions of instigating a military strike against the country. His actions came after receiving intelligence that the Chinese thought the U.S. was planning to initiate an attack after an uptick of U.S. Armed Forces' operations in the South China Sea and Trump's rhetoric about the nation.\n\nMilley told Li that he would give him advance notice if the U.S. ever were to take such actions.\n\nThe second call Milley made was on Jan. 8, 2021, two days after the Capitol riot, to alleviate Li's concerns about the steadiness of the U.S. government and how that might impact China's national security.\n\nIn response to the book, Trump released a statement saying that if there was veracity to the claim, \"then I assume (Milley) would be tried for TREASON in that he would have been dealing with his Chinese counterpart behind the President's back and telling China that he would be giving them notification 'of an attack.' Can't do that!\"\n\nRegarding Pelosi, the former House speaker, Gosar echoed Republican sentiments that Pelosi was to blame for the attack, published in late December in an alternative Jan. 6 report from House Republicans. According to factcheck.org, which is run by the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center, this claim is unsubstantiated.\n\nThe Pentagon and Pelosi's office did not respond to requests for comment. Gosar's office also did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe new House GOP majority has voted to create the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government that will investigate President Joe Biden and actions by the executive branch , which could include looking into the FBI and/or Justice Department's handling of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot.\n\nThe rules package passed Monday also ended the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack, established by the prior, Democrat-controlled Congress to investigate the events of that day. The committee reported on the roles of Gosar and Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz. Both have denied any part in the planning of the riot.\n\nBiggs and Gosar were referred to the House Ethics Committee for ignoring subpoenas to testify before the Jan 6. committee. Under the new rules in the 118th Congress, the House Ethics Committee has been weakened. Among other changes, the committee can only bring on new employees during the first month, and term limits were instituted for members, effectively kicking out all of the Democrats except one.\n\nTara Kavaler is a politics reporter at The Arizona Republic.

      "text": "Rep. Paul Gosar back on House committees, including powerful investigatory panel\n\nRep. Paul Gosar has been reinstated to his previous House committees after being kicked off in 2021 for his conduct online.\n\nGosar, R-Ariz., is rejoining the House Oversight and Accountability and the Natural Resources committees after being stripped of his assignments for briefly posting an anime style video attacking Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.\n\nRepublicans last year won control of the House from the Democrats and are now in charge of running committees.\n\nThe oversight committee is the House's primary investigative body over the federal government. Gosar already called for an investigation into the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair Mark Milley for telling his Chinese counterpart that he would warn him if the U.S. was planning to attack. He also has said that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's conduct surrounding the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S Capitol riot should be given more scrutiny.\n\nGosar said in a written statement on rejoining his previous committees: \"I further look forward to restoring government accountability that has been absent under the Biden regime beginning with the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability thoroughly investigating Biden's support for an invasion along our southern border in which my great state of Arizona and my district are both ground zero. I also look forward to working with my colleagues on the committee to conduct rigorous oversight over Joe Biden and end the Biden Administration's unchecked one-party rule and rooting out waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement in the federal government.\"\n\nThe Natural Resources Committee crafts laws about, other things, national parks, indigenous people, and energy production .\n\nWith Republicans now in charge of the committee, Rep. Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., the ranking Democrat on the panel, anticipates that GOP leadership, including Gosar, will be the \"most pro-oil and gas majority that I've seen in my time in Congress.\"\n\n\"In basically every policy, they promote privatizing our public lands to oil and gas. ... That's been Gosar's agenda from the time I've been sitting there in that same committee for 14 years,\" Grijalva told The Arizona Republic. \"I don't see him changing his tactics. He's going to continue to say and do things that are ... counter to how our committee should work.\"\n\nGrijalva, who has been in Congress for two decades, is concerned about what the committee will do on mining on public lands and how Native Americans will be treated.\n\n\" With Gosar's connection to the mining industry, I see a big push on the part of the resources committee to open up the Grand Canyon and (Pinal County's) Oak Flat to uranium mining. And those are key areas in which Indian country ... wants to preserve and protect,\" he said.\n\nGosar's office did not immediately respond to The Republic's request for comment.\n\nGosar, who is in his seventh House term, represents Arizona's 9th Congressional District, which includes the majority of the state's western border, including parts of La Paz, Maricopa, Mohave, and Yuma counties .\n\nTara Kavaler is a politics reporter at The Arizona Republic.

      "text": "Rep. Paul Gosar under bipartisan fire for again defending white nationalist\n\nRep. Paul Gosar is again under fire on social media for his apparent continuing support of an extremist who's been labeled a white nationalist.\n\nGosar, R.-Ariz., shared a movie trailer for \"The Most Canceled Man in America,\" a new documentary about Nick Fuentes, whom the Southern Poverty Law Center describes as a white nationalist.\n\nThe film frames him as a target of the government after his involvement in the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot and other protests.\n\nGosar previously has supported, and then tried to distance himself from, Fuentes, an extreme far-right figure in the Republican realm.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League says Fuentes is a white supremacist leader and organizer who has used his online platforms for anti-Semitic and racist comments.\n\n\"The persecution against Christians and Conservatives by the Biden Regime brings great dishonor to our country,\" Gosar wrote on Twitter on Friday, sharing an August trailer for the movie featuring Fuentes. \"If Americans do not have the freedom to dissent, then they have no freedom at all.\"\n\nThomas Galvin, a Republican on the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, wrote on Twitter a scathing response to Gosar's post.\n\n\"Nick Fuentes is not a conservative and his racist and anti-Semitic rants don't hint of Christian values. Paul, you are an extremist consumed by conspiracy theories when you should be working on real issues that matter to AZ. Enough is enough. Real AZ Republicans are sick of this,\" Galvin wrote.\n\nRep. Ruben Gallego, D.-Ariz., also ripped Gosar.\n\n\"Paul, Nick Fuentes is a white supremacist and incel why are you defending someone like that? What is about him that made you want to defend him,\" Gallego tweeted. \"I would say to all these incels and Fuente supporters to get off the internets it's Friday go out and have fun..but this is their extent of social interaction.\"\n\nGosar is seeking a seventh term in Congress but is unopposed on the Nov. 8 general election ballot. He faces challenges only from write-in candidates in Arizona's 9th Congressional District.\n\nThis is not the first time Gosar has been tied to Fuentes, who has been banned from YouTube for repeatedly violating rules against hate speech. He also has been banned from Twitter and elsewhere.\n\nGosar has in the past promoted or defended Fuentes, gotten criticism, and then tried to distance himself, and that cycle may be continuing.\n\nIn June 2021, Gosar was reportedly planning a fundraising event with Fuentes, having earlier in the year skipped a vote on a COVID-19 relief bill to attend a far-right conference held by Fuentes.\n\nAt the start of the year, Gosar defended Fuentes on Gab, a social networking site that attracts the ultra-right-wing.\n\nGosar wrote: \"The phony January 6th Committee's partisan witch-hunt continues as they have now set their sights on young conservative Christians like Nick Fuentes. This is pure political persecution and it has to stop. @realnickjfuentes.\" Fuentes responded: \"Thank you Congressman!\"\n\nBut then in April, Gosar tried to make distance with Fuentes, saying he didn't intend to make a video greeting for the white nationalist's annual conference, even though he went in-person the year before. He said he didn't know about Fuentes' background before going to his 2021 conference.\n\n\"I've given up ... on dealing with Nick. Nick's got a problem with his mouth,\" Gosar said in April.\n\nRepublic reporters Ronald J.

      "text": "House votes to censure Rep. Paul Gosar for posting violent video depicting attacks on Biden, AOC\n\nWASHINGTON - The House of Representatives censured GOP Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., for posting an anime video that was edited to show him killing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and attacking President Joe Biden.\n\nThe House voted 223-207 to censure Gosar, with one \"present\" vote and three abstentions. The vote largely fell along party lines, two Republicans alongside all Democrats voting for censure.\n\nThis is the most serious action the House can take to punish a lawmaker short of expulsion from Congress. Gosar will be stripped of his committee assignments but will remain a House member. The last time the House voted to censure one of its members was in 2010, against former Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y., over ethics violations. It was the 24th time the House had censured a lawmaker in its history.\n\nGosar faced widespread criticism after he posted an edited anime-style video to his social media accounts appearing to show him killing his colleague , Ocasio-Cortez, and attacking Biden. It mimicked the theme song and introduction of \"Attack on Titan,\" a popular Japanese animation series. Twitter flagged the video for violating its rules against calls for violence. It was later deleted.\n\nGosar was defiant about being censured: \"I do not espouse violence against anyone. I never have,\" he said. \"There is no threat in the cartoon other than the threat that immigration poses to our country.\"\n\nHe had released an open letter apologizing to his colleagues but not to Ocasio-Cortez, stating that his staff had released the video and that \"nothing hateful\" was intended by the imagery.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Tuesday the House would be voting to censure Gosar, \"because he made threats, suggestions about harming a member of Congress. That is an insult - not only endangerment of that member of Congress, but an insult to the institution of the House of Representatives.\"\n\nAt issue for Democrats is a broader concern over increasing calls for political violence on the American right that have escalated in the months since the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.\n\n\"We cannot have a member joking about murdering each other or threatening the president of the United States,\" Pelosi said Wednesday during debate, warning that calls for violence against lawmakers is \"a danger to everyone\" because \"the example set in this House is one viewed across the country.\"\n\nThe two Republicans who voted to censure Gosar, Reps. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., and Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., have become pariahs in their own party for frequent criticisms of GOP adherence to Trump and perceived political radicalization.\n\nMost Republicans shrugged off Gosar's actions, accusing Democrats of overreacting to his posts.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., called the censure vote an \"abuse of power,\" claiming there are double standards for different sides of the aisle.\n\n\"House Democrats have broken nearly every rule and standard in order to silence dissidents and pass their radical agenda,\" McCarthy said during debate, citing comments from Reps. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. , Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. , and Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. , that drew criticism from both parties in the past.\n\nMcCarthy threatened that the Democrats had now set a precedent that any lawmaker who made allegedly inflammatory comments would \"need the vote of the majority\" to avoid censure, promising that \"a new standard will continue to be applied in the future.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez pushed back, accusing McCarthy of deflecting from the issue at hand.\n\n\"What is so hard about saying that this is wrong?\" she asked, continuing that the moment was \"about what we accept.\"\n\nRep. Kelly Armstrong, R-N.D., called Gosar's video \"dumb,\" \"silly\" and \"mean-spirited\" but rejected that it was a \"call to violence.\" He accused Democrats of not applying the rules of Congress \"equally\" between the two parties.\n\n\"This will be the fourth member of the minority stripped of their assignments by the majority. That has never happened,\" said Armstrong.\n\nDemocrats are \"negatively and permanently changing the way this body functions forever,\" Armstrong continued, and cautioned that \"when the pendulum swings, and it will, you will all suffer the consequences. And the institution will suffer for it, and it is already suffering for it.\"\n\nOhio Republican Jim Jordan likened it to an attack on the First Amendment.\n\n\"What scares me most about this is the attack on the freedom of speech from the Left this year,\" said Jordan, claiming Democrats were \"censuring speech\" with their censure vote.\n\nRep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., was among the Democrats who noted that Gosar's video was created by his staff and thus used House resources to \"depict the murder\" of one of his colleagues. He said the censure vote was necessary because Republicans had \"not taken responsibility for members of its own caucus.\"\n\nRep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., who introduced the resolution to censure Gosar, said the action was regrettable but necessary.\n\n\"If a Democrat did the same thing, I would introduce the same resolution,\" Speier said.\n\n\"We have an opportunity today to choose decency over demonization, to choose civility over cynicism, to choose the rule of law over reckless and violent behavior,\" Jeffries, the New York Democrat, urged during debate. \"We can not normalize violence at any point in our future.\"\n\nRep. Teresa Legar Fernandez, D-N.M., quoted Scripture in her floor speech arguing for the necessity of censuring Gosar, contending, \"the love of thy neighbor is calling on us to pass this resolution.\"\n\n\"Is this the state of Republican Party today? If you vote for a bipartisan bill, your own colleagues will call for retribution. But if you tweet a video depicting the murder of a colleague and depicting violence against the president of the United States that's somehow OK? Come on,\" Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said before the vote.\n\n\"Rejecting political violence should not be a partisan effort,\" said Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Pa., before the vote. \"We must say that political violence is not acceptable in the United States of America.\"\n\nFollow Matthew Brown online @mrbrownsir ."

      "text": "Paul Gosar: Siblings savage congressman in attack advert\n\nArizona Congressman Paul Gosar, a Republican from the party's most conservative wing, is standing for re-election in November.\n\nFearing for the future, his siblings have thrown their weight behind their choice of candidate in a powerful new TV advert.\n\nThe striking part? It's not their brother.\n\nNope - six of Mr Gosar's siblings have spoken out to endorse his rival, Democrat David Brill.\n\nIf that sounds brutal on paper, the execution is even more savage. To maximise its impact, the ad doesn't name the six speakers until the end - they're just presented as normal Arizona folks.\n\nIt opens with \"Grace, rural physician\", declaring, \"Paul Gosar the congressman isn't doing anything to support rural America.\"\n\n\"Paul's absolutely not working for his district,\" says \"David, lawyer\".\n\n\"If he actually cared about people in rural Arizona, I bet he'd be fighting for social security, for better access to healthcare,\" agrees \"Jennifer, medical interpreter\".\n\n\"He is not listening to you, and he does not have your best interests at heart,\" \"Tim\" agrees - before dropping the bombshell line: \"My name is Tim Gosar\".\n\nSo is this a shock move from David, Tim, Jennifer, Gaston, Joan, and Grace?\n\nLocal paper the Arizona Republic calls it \"brutal, but not unexpected\". Mr Gosar made headlines after the violent neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017, by suggesting it was planned by \"the Left\" to undermine Donald Trump. He then branded Democratic Party donor George Soros a Nazi collaborator in an interview with Vice News.\n\nHorrified, seven of his siblings signed an open letter to the Kingman Daily Miner , stating: \"It is extremely upsetting to have to call you out on this, Paul, but you've forced our hand with your deceit and anti-Semitic dog whistle.\"\n\nPaul Gosar's other controversies include boycotting a 2015 speech to Congress by Pope Francis. He criticised the pontiff's support for climate change, calling it \"questionable science\" deployed \"to guilt people into leftist policies\".\n\nHe has also defended British far-right activist Tommy Robinson , and attacked \"disgusting and depraved\" Muslim immigrants at a speech in London in July.\n\nFurther anti-Gosar adverts set to air on TV soon include one titled \"A family defends its honor,\" where David Gosar says: \"We've got to stand up for our good name, this is not who we are.\"\n\n\"It would be difficult to see my brother as anything but a racist,\" Grace Gosar says in another, according to the Phoenix New Times.\n\nRepresentative Gosar responded to the ad campaign in a series of scathing tweets on Saturday.\n\nIn it he labelled his siblings as \"disgruntled Hillary supporters\" and said \"see you at Mom and Dad's house!\"\n\nThe Republican, who won his district with 71% of the vote in 2016, is still considered likely to keep the seat he has held since 2011.\n\nIf there is a bright side for Mr Gosar, it's that he is one of 10 siblings. While seven have denounced him in public, two are keeping their silence so far - which might make Christmas fractionally less awkward.\n\nHis mother has also vocally supported his leadership and politics, leading him to quip: \"I guess I really am Mom's favourite\"\n\nPaul Gosar is far from the first US politician to be targeted by a critical advert, of course.\n\nSo-called \"attack ads\", in which a candidate lambasts their opponent instead of stressing their own virtues, have been a recognised tactic since the 1960s.\n\nWhen Democrat Lyndon Johnson was running against Republican Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election, one famous TV ad featured a young girl counting down as she pulled petals off a daisy , then cut to a nuclear explosion.\n\nJohnson's voice boomed over the footage: \"These are the stakes. To make a world in which all of God's children can live, or to go into the dark. We must either love each other, or we must die.\"\n\nMr Goldwater was never mentioned, but the message was clear - his more aggressive attitude to the Cold War would imperil the public and could lead to nuclear doom. Johnson was the only safe choice. The ad was considered controversial, but highly effective. Johnson won by a landslide.\n\nDecades later, Hillary Clinton deployed a slightly subtler but clearly negative ad against Barack Obama, her rival in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries. It opened with shots of children fast asleep, and a voiceover saying, \"It's 3am and your children are safe and asleep. But there's a phone in the White House, and it's ringing. Something's happening in the world...\"\n\nThe message urged voters to choose someone who \"already knows the world's leaders, knows the military\" and is \"tested and ready to lead in a dangerous world\" to pick up the phone. The implication: Obama lacks the experience to lead.\n\nThe future president wasn't above making digs of his own, however.\n\nIn June 2016, then presidential candidate Donald Trump dug up an old Obama radio advert criticising Mrs Clinton for making \"false attacks\" and shared it online. He tweeted: \"I rarely agree with President Obama - however he is 100% correct about Crooked Hillary Clinton. Great ad!\"\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

'It's a cartoon, relax,' he said. Really?,\" Pelosi said.\n\nMr Gosar, for his part, said he rejects \"the false narrative\" that he espouses violence and said the video depicts \"a policy battle\".\n\nEarlier this year Democrats stripped another Republican lawmaker, Marjorie Taylor Greene, of committee assignments for past remarks that included support for violence against Democrats.\n\nConservatives accused them of hypocrisy for taking no punitive action against a Democratic lawmaker, Ilhan Omar, who made remarks that were construed as anti-Semitic.\n\nThe House resolution, which was posted online on Tuesday, calls for Mr Gosar to be removed from the Committee on Oversight and the Natural Resources Committee.\n\nThe 90-second video posted on 8 November featured an edited version of a Japanese anime cartoon interspersed with scenes from the US-Mexico border.\n\nIn one portion, characters whose faces were replaced by Mr Gosar and other prominent conservative Republicans were shown fighting other characters.\n\nOne character, who had been made to look like New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, was seen being hit in the neck with a sword. A character altered to look like Mr Biden was also seen being attacked.\n\nIn response, top Democrat Nancy Pelosi tweeted that \"threats of violence against Members of Congress and the President of the United States must not be tolerated\".\n\nMr Gosar has denied the video was inciting violence.\n\nIn a statement, he said \"the cartoon depicts the symbolic nature of a battle between lawful and unlawful policies and in no way intended to be a targeted attack against Representative Cortez or Mr Biden.\n\n\"It is a symbolic cartoon. It is not real life.\"\n\nTwitter added a warning label to the tweet, after determining it had violated the company's rules on \"hateful conduct\".\n\nWhile attending the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, Ms Ocasio-Cortez called Mr Gosar \"creepy\" and described his tweet as a \"fantasy video of him killing me\".\n\nMr Gosar has previously drawn scrutiny for spreading false information about the 2020 presidential election and appearing at a rally where a far-right activist spoke in favour of white nationalism.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene defiant after failing to remove House Speaker Mike Johnson\n\nRepublican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has struck a defiant tone after the failure of her bid to remove Mike Johnson as Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\nShe had demanded Mr Johnson be kicked out due to his support for a $61bn aid package for Ukraine.\n\nHowever, Democrats joined Republicans in a 359-43 vote to kill her motion.\n\nMs Greene's speech on the House floor was met by loud boos from other members of the chamber.\n\nOn Thursday, Ms Greene posted on X, formerly Twitter: \"Democrats voted to save Johnson because they knew it was impossible to take control of the House.\n\n\"They want to keep Johnson because he's given them everything they want... The good news this morning is now the American people have been shown the truth.\"\n\nThe long-telegraphed motion proved to be a rare act of defiance against the party's presumptive presidential nominee - Donald Trump. He had previously voiced support for the House Speaker and called the drive to oust him \"unfortunate\".\n\nOnly two other Republican members of Congress supported Ms Greene's motion: Thomas Massie and Paul Gosar.\n\nJoined by Mr Massie, Ms Greene stood on the House floor and criticised Mr Johnson for a series of compromises he has struck with Democrats, who hold a majority in the Senate.\n\n\"This is the 'uniparty' for the American people watching,\" she said of politicians in the chamber as they booed her.\n\n\"By passing the Democrats' agenda and handcuffing the Republicans' ability and influence legislation, our elected Republican Speaker Mike Johnson has aided and abetted the Democrats and the Biden administration in destroying our country,\" she added.\n\nMr Johnson could be seen walking around the House floor after Ms Greene began her motion, with Republican supporters shaking his hand and patting him on the back.\n\nShortly after the vote, Mr Johnson said he hoped this would end \"the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined the 118th Congress\".\n\n\"I'm glad that this distraction is not going to inhibit that important work and all the other things that are on the table and on the agenda for us right now,\" he added.\n\nAt the time of Ms Greene's speech, Mr Trump posted a message on his Truth Social platform calling on Republicans to reject her motion to vacate the speaker's post.\n\nWhile Mr Trump began his post with \"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene\", he told Republican members of Congress that \"this is not the time\" to remove Mr Johnson.\n\n\"If we show DISUNITY, which will be portrayed as CHAOS, it will negatively affect everything!\" he said, adding that the Republican Speaker was a \"good man who is trying very hard\".\n\nIn March, Ms Greene filed the motion that would eventually trigger the vote on Mr Johnson's removal, though it was unclear when or if she would advance it.\n\nShe did so on Wednesday by forcing the Republican-led chamber to hold a vote on the House leader's position in no more than two legislative days.\n\nThe same legislative move was used to remove former Republican Speaker Kevin McCarthy in the autumn, leaving the chamber without an elected leader for three weeks.\n\nDemocrats made the unusual move to back a Republican House Speaker due to the razor-thin margins in the chamber, but they recently criticised Mr Johnson for holding several meetings with her this week.\n\n\"When Speaker Johnson meets with her for hours, the American people should be asking 'what is Marjorie Taylor Greene extracting from the speaker?'\" Democratic congressman Ted Lieu said on Tuesday, according to Axios.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Johnson said the talks were not a \"negotiation\" and denied that Republican leaders were considering any concessions for her support.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nBBC Verify has looked at the agency's biggest claimed savings, examining the figures and speaking to experts.\n\nSantos' downfall included him being the first member of Congress to be expelled in more than 20 years.\n\nThe former US senator offers some typically frank advice as he urges his old party to work with the president.\n\nBoeing's boss says it's looking to sell 50 more planes China has on order to other countries.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Coronavirus: US Republicans self-quarantine amid outbreak\n\nFive senior US Republicans have quarantined themselves after coming into contact with a person who tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nThe members of Congress, who include Texas Senator Ted Cruz, self-isolated after they shook hands with an infected individual at a conference.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who was also at the event last month, insists he is in good health and has not taken a test.\n\nOne Democrat has also self-isolated after she met someone with the virus.\n\nThere are more than 700 confirmed cases in the US and 26 people have died so far.\n\nMr Cruz, Arizona Congressman Paul Gosar, Georgia Congressman Doug Collins and Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz are all self-quarantining for the recommended 14-days after they met the same infected person at CPAC, a conservative political conference, at the end of February.\n\nRepublican Representative Mark Meadows, President Donald Trump's newly appointed chief of staff, also met the person and is in self-quarantine. He is not exhibiting any symptoms and a precautionary test came back negative, a spokesman said.\n\nMr Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence attended the same event in Maryland but neither of them interacted with the individual. Mr Trump did shake hands with the conference chairman who had had contact with the patient.\n\nBut, on Monday, the White House announced that Mr Trump had not been tested for the virus. \"He has neither had prolonged close contact with any known confirmed Covid-19 patients, nor does he have any symptoms,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\n\"President Trump remains in excellent health, and his physician will continue to closely monitor him,\" she added.\n\nThe White House announcement came as it warned the number of cases in the US was likely to rise. \"There will be more cases,\" Mr Pence told reporters. \"But we simply ask today for the American people to engage in the common sense practices.\"\n\nThe vice-president, who also confirmed he had not been tested for the virus, said the administration was consulting Congress on providing paid sick leave to workers.\n\nSeparately, in brief remarks, Mr Trump said he would take \"major\" steps to protect the economy against the impact of the outbreak. \"We'll be discussing a possible payroll tax cut or relief, substantial relief,\" he told reporters.\n\nHe did not provide further details on his plans, but said there would be a news conference on Tuesday.\n\n\"This blindsided the world, and I think we've handled it very, very well,\" he said of the virus.\n\nThe president's comments came as stock markets plunged. Shares around the world had their worst day since the financial crisis on Monday, and analysts described the market reaction to the coronavirus as \"utter carnage\".\n\nCases of the virus have been recorded in 34 states plus Washington DC.\n\nThere have been 738 confirmed cases and 26 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n\nMeanwhile, passengers aboard a virus-hit cruise liner in California have begun disembarking after being kept off the coast of San Francisco for five days.\n\nNineteen crew members and two passengers on the Grand Princess have tested positive for Covid-19.  Most of the passengers will go into quarantine at military bases or, if they require more immediate medical attention, nearby hospitals.\n\nSeveral hundred foreign passengers, including 140 Britons, will be repatriated to their home countries.\n\nThe ship's crew members will remain quarantined on board, which will depart from Oakland as soon as the passengers have disembarked, officials said.\n\nThe cruise ship came to the attention of the authorities when a previous voyager on the vessel died last week after being stricken by the coronavirus.\n\nThe 71-year-old, who had an underlying health condition, had been on a round trip from San Francisco to Mexico.\n\nIn neighbouring Canada, as of Monday morning, there were 76 confirmed or presumptive cases of people carrying the coronavirus disease. There was one confirmed death in North Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nMost of the cases are in the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia, though some have also been discovered in Quebec and Alberta.\n\nCanadian public health officials are advising against all cruise ship travel. Just last week, Canadian passengers of the Diamond Princess cruise ship were released from quarantine.\n\nItaly now has the highest number of confirmed infections outside China, where the outbreak originated in December. It has confirmed 7,375 cases and overtaken South Korea, where the total number is 7,313.\n\nSome 16 million people - a quarter of Italy's population - are under strict quarantine measures.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Republicans 'frustrated' after healthcare fiasco\n\nRepublican House Speaker Paul Ryan has said he is \"disappointed and frustrated\" by the Senate's failure to repeal the Obama-era healthcare act.\n\nHe is among several lawmakers to express frustration after three Republican senators opposed a bill to scale back parts of the US health law.\n\nThe so-called \"skinny\" repeal is the Senate's third failed attempt to roll back Obamacare.\n\nIt is considered a blow to Republicans who vowed for years to repeal the law.\n\nThe legislation fell apart during the early hours on Friday, when Arizona Senator John McCain cast the decisive vote to reject the bill by 51 to 49 in the Republican-dominated Senate.\n\nHe joined Senators Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins in opposing the plan.\n\nAn estimate from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found the \"skinny\" repeal would have resulted in 16 million people losing their health insurance by 2026, with insurance premiums increasing by 20%.\n\nMr Ryan said Republicans \"should not give up\" on the plan, but added that he would now turn his attention to overhauling the tax code.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, described the result as a \"disappointing moment\".\n\nHe continued: \"It's time to move on.\"\n\nAlabama Congressman Mo Brooks blamed Mr McConnell for the failure, telling CNN \"the leadership at the top is responsible. The buck stops there\".\n\n\"If Mitch McConnell cannot get the job done on this, how is he going to get the job done on the rest of President Trump's agenda over the next three and a half years?\" he asked.\n\nMr Brooks added that Mr McConnell should pressure the Senate to pass a new version of former President Barack Obama's signature law - the Affordable Care act - or step down.\n\nIowa Congressman singled out Mrs Murkowski and Mr McCain for the loss.\n\nHe said Mrs Murkowski \"was initially appointed to her position by her father\" and that her write-in campaign in 2010 \"was essentially a revolt\" against Republican primary voters.\n\nMrs Murkowski was elected to her fourth term last year.\n\nCongressman Paul Gosar, an Arizona Republican, was among several lawmakers to share his disappointment on Twitter.\n\nTexas Senator John Cornyn tweeted it was up to Democrats now to protect Americans from a market collapse.\n\nIowa Senator Joni Ernst tweeted she was \"disappointed\" the Senate could not repeal the \"flawed law\" while Georgia Senator David Perdue blamed \"an unworkable budget process and politicians who put their political self-interests ahead of national interest\".\n\n\"The American people should be outraged and should demand real change now,\" he said in a statement . \"It is extremely important that we get this fixed.\"\n\nBut Republican Ohio Governor John Kasich applauded Mr McCain, Mrs Murkowski and Mrs Collins in a tweet on Friday , saying \"Courage is contagious\".\n\nPresident Trump lamented the failed vote during a speech at Suffolk County Community College in New York on Friday afternoon, but added \"you can't have everything\".\n\nHe told the crowd he said from the beginning to \"let Obamacare implode\" first and then repeal it.\n\n\"I turned out to be right,\" he added.\n\nA spokesman for Mr Obama weighed in on the debate on Friday, praising those who \"mobilised, organised and made their voices heard\".\n\n\"President Obama still believes that it is possible for Congress to demonstrate the necessary bipartisanship and political courage to keep delivering on the promise of quality, affordable health insurance for Americans,\" Kevin Lewis said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer lauded the three senators who voted against the bill.\n\n\"I have not seen a senator who speaks truth to power as strongly as well as frequently as John McCain,\" he said at a news conference on Friday.\n\nHe also called Mrs Collins and Mrs Murkowksi tough women and said he spoke to Speaker Ryan on Friday about working on bipartisan legislation.\n\nBy Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington\n\nInstead of beating the drum for healthcare reform, the administration has been all over the map.\n\nA hastily announced ban on transgender individuals in the armed forces, issued by presidential tweet. A press conference to herald efforts to combat gang violence. A campaign-style rally in Ohio with a focus on the threats of illegal immigration. A speech to a Boy Scouts gathering that was heavy on media bashing.\n\nIn case that wasn't enough, over the past week the administration has been beset by internecine warfare. Mr Trump publicly questioned the effectiveness of his former campaign confidant, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, subjecting him to an increasingly angry barrage of tweets.\n\nRead Anthony in full\n\nThe bill - officially known as the Health Care Freedom Act - would have eliminated parts of Obamacare, including the individual mandate requiring all Americans to have health insurance coverage or pay a fine, and the employer mandate, which requires the same of companies with 50 employees or more.\n\nIt also would have temporarily repealed a tax on medical devices, defund the US women's group Planned Parenthood for a year and provide more money to community health centres, as well as given states more flexibility in complying with Obamacare regulations.\n\nBut the pared-down measure would have left much of Obamacare untouched, including the expansion of Medicaid, a government health programme for the poor that faced deep cuts in earlier proposals.\n\nA requirement that all insurance plans cover essential health benefits, federal subsidies to help consumers pay for insurance as well as taxes on wealthy Americans also would have remained in place.\n\nThe stripped down bill came after earlier Senate defeats for proposals to replace Obamacare and then to partially repeal it.\n\nMr McCain said he had voted against the skinny repeal because it did not amount to meaningful reform and would not have improved care for Americans.\n\nThere are not thought to be any further plans for a new bill to repeal Obamacare because the skinny repeal was seen as the only measure Republicans could get through Congress.\n\nHowever, lawmakers could revive the issue and take it up later in the year.\n\nFollowing the vote, President Trump tweeted: \"As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal.\"\n\nMr Trump's position on healthcare reform has varied - he has spoken out at various points for Obamacare being repealed, repealed and replaced, or being allowed to collapse by itself.\n\nIn his statement, Mr McCain said Obamacare was in a state of \"collapse\", with healthcare premiums \"skyrocketing\" and providers \"fleeing the marketplace\".\n\nHe criticised the way Obamacare had been passed by Democrats using their Obama-era majority and called for senators to \"return to the correct way of legislating\" with input from both parties.\n\n\"We must do the hard work our citizens expect of us and deserve,\" he said.\n\nBut Texas Senator Ted Cruz insisted the fight was not over.\n\n\"Mark my words, this journey is not yet done,\" he said.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Texas shooting: How false rumours spread that gunman was trans\n\nMinutes after Tuesday's tragic shooting at the Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, false rumours began spreading about the identity of the gunman.\n\nImages of three separate trans women were shared online purporting to be of the gunman, and leading to a barrage of abuse.\n\nThe inaccurate claims were also amplified by US politicians and political influencers, some of whom also more broadly linked transgenderism to violence.\n\nAlmost immediately after the shooting, pictures of the gunman, Salvador Ramos, 18, appeared online.\n\nRamos didn't have a huge social media footprint - but one photo in particular was widely circulated. Taken from his Instagram and TikTok accounts, it showed him looking into a mirror wearing a dark grey hoodie.\n\nThe rumour that he was trans appears to have started on the fringe message board 4chan, and in particular the /pol/ or \"Politically Incorrect\" board, which has for years been associated with the far-right and mass shootings. A controversial hub of internet subculture, 4chan has been the birthplace of many harassment and trolling campaigns.\n\nUsers posted an image of a trans woman who slightly resembled Ramos, along with a link to her Reddit profile, and baselessly claimed she was the gunman.\n\nIt didn't take long for the claim to migrate to other, larger social platforms, and it began to be repeated by far-right and right-wing activists and politicians.\n\nConservative activist Candace Owens claimed there were photos of the gunman \"cross-dressing\", and claimed this was evidence that \"there were plenty of signs that he was mentally disturbed\".\n\nRepublican congressman Paul Gosar, of Arizona, repeated the trans claim in a tweet that he later deleted. Mr Gosar also called the gunman, who was born in the United States, an \"illegal alien\", although Texas governor Greg Abbott, also a Republican, stated that Ramos was a US citizen.\n\nWe contacted Ms Owens, and Mr Gosar's spokesperson, for comment.\n\nAnother congressman, Pete Sessions, claimed in an interview on the Today Programme on Thursday that Ramos \"wore dresses\".\n\nSam, the transgender woman targeted by the 4chan campaign, posted on Reddit saying that she didn't live in Texas and was alive after the shooting, even though Ramos was shot dead.\n\nBut Sam - not her real name - wasn't the only trans person targeted by false stories. Images of Sabrina, another trans woman, appeared in photo collages alongside the actual photo of the gunman, with similar false claims.\n\nShe posted an image of herself holding her phone with the time and date visible to prove she was alive after the shooting. And another trans person's image which also appeared on 4chan later popped up in far-right spaces, including conspiracy theorist Alex Jones's Infowars website.\n\nThis is not the first time that trans and other LGBT individuals have been the targets of misinformation, says Mallory Moore, a researcher with the Trans Safety Network, a UK-based organisation.\n\nShe says the organisation advised Sabrina on how to put social media safeguards in place following the attack and online abuse - something she described as \"pre-emptive\".\n\n\"As things tend to spiral, people will pick through someone's social media and dump it online,\" she says. \"Getting ahead of that is a sensible precaution.\"\n\nAs often happens after mass shootings, a number of other false rumours spread in the wake of the attack.\n\nBBC News observed at least a dozen fake accounts claiming to belong to the gunman in the aftermath, most of which were attempts to copy his removed, genuine account on Instagram. Most have been removed.\n\nRoz Foyer questioned the Supreme Court's ruling on gender.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nCarla Denyer says the equalities watchdog's guidance puts trans people at risk of discrimination.\n\nRoz Foyer, head of the STUC, said she did not agree with the Equalities and Human Rights Commission guidance.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Adam Schiff: Republicans punish Trump critic over Russia investigations\n\nThe US House of Representatives has voted to punish Democrat Adam Schiff for accusing Donald Trump of colluding with Russia to win the 2016 election.\n\nThe Republican-controlled chamber approved the measure along party lines, with 213 Republicans voting in favour and 209 Democrats against it.\n\nKnown as a \"censure\", the rare step is a formal public reprimand of misconduct that does not warrant an expulsion.\n\nMr Schiff said he would wear the vote of disapproval as a \"badge of honour\".\n\nHe sarcastically thanked Republicans ahead of the vote for their \"enmity\" and said he would \"not yield. Not one inch\".\n\nAs he made his way to the well of the House floor to face his formal rebuke after the vote, several Democrats surrounded him with cheers, pats on the back, and chants of \"shame!\" and \"Adam\".\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, was unable to read out the censure resolution amid Democratic heckling, with one lawmaker yelling \"censure all of us\".\n\nThe California congressman is the 25th House member in history to be censured, and only the third in the last 20 years.\n\nAs the top-ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee during the Trump presidency, Mr Schiff led the panel's investigation into Mr Trump's finances and alleged links to Russia.\n\nThe House probe concluded that Russia had tried to influence the 2016 election, but some of Mr Schiff's claims as chairman were not substantiated by two separate special counsel investigations of the then-president.\n\nMr Schiff reprised his role as a Trump antagonist during the Republican's first impeachment trial in 2019, in which he served as lead prosecutor. Mr Trump was acquitted by the US Senate.\n\nThis January, Mr Schiff was booted from the intelligence committee by the new Republican House majority.\n\nFlorida Republican Anna Paulina Luna, who led the effort to censure Mr Schiff this month, alleged he \"abused\" his position to launch \"an all-out political campaign against a sitting president\".\n\nWednesday's resolution was her second attempt to punish her Democratic counterpart. Last week, a similar censure that would have required Mr Schiff to pay a $16m (£12.5m) fine unless he resigned from Congress failed as some Republican lawmakers voted against it.\n\nThe measure passed this week directs the House ethics committee to investigate Mr Schiff over his past words and actions relating to the Trump probes. It drew praise from Mr Trump himself, who threatened that Republicans who voted against the measure should be \"immediately\" challenged for their seats.\n\nThe censure has little practical effect, especially given that Mr Schiff is already eyeing election to the US Senate, but it is evidence of an escalating tit-for-tat in the embattled congressional chamber.\n\nArizona Republican Paul Gosar was the last lawmaker to be censured, in 2021, after he posted an animated video online that showed him striking Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a sword. Republicans warned at the time that the Democrats had set \"a new standard\".\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Republican-led House panel to focus on Biden family business\n\nCongressman James Comer, the new Republican chair of the House Oversight Committee, said on Monday morning that \"influence peddling\" by President Joe Biden's family would be a top investigatory priority for him, starting with public hearings next week.\n\n\"We have evidence - that we've been transparent with and will continue to be transparent with - where this family has taken in millions and millions of dollars from our adversaries, mainly in China,\" the Kentucky Republican said in a speech to the National Press Club in Washington DC. \"I think we need to determine what was that money for. Who supplied that money?\"\n\nThe president and his family have denied any wrongdoing in overseas business dealings. Donald Trump's children have also been accused of conflicts of interest in lucrative business deals overseas.\n\nMr Comer said on Monday that the Trump administration had a problem with influence-peddling, mentioning Mr Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, specifically. Mr Kushner has also denied any wrongdoing.\n\nInvestigations into Joe Biden's personal finances, including the international business dealings of his son Hunter Biden, are just one item on an ambitious agenda Mr Comer has set out over recent weeks.\n\nThe 52-year-old younger Mr Biden is already under federal investigation, but has so far not faced any charges. He is not involved with the administration in any capacity and the White House has said the inquiries were politically motivated.\n\nNext Tuesday, the oversight committee will hear testimony from executives at Twitter on their decision to temporarily ban links to a New York Post article on Hunter Biden's abandoned laptop in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe handling of the laptop story, which presented evidence of the younger Mr Biden's business dealings with China and Ukraine as well as his personal struggles with drug abuse, has been a focus of conservative anger toward the social media company.\n\nOn Wednesday, the committee will hold hearings on allegations of waste and fraud in the distribution of Covid relief and economic stimulus funds.\n\nOther topics on the committee's agenda include the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, classified documents recently discovered at Mr Biden's personal office and residence, the Biden administration's border-security and immigration policies, the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, healthcare and prescription drug costs, and the increase in energy prices over the past two years.\n\nRepublicans won control of the lower chamber, the US House of Representatives, in the November midterm elections and they now chair all the committees, which deal with issues like oversight, the economy and labour.\n\nMr Comer criticised the Biden administration for what he said is a lack of transparency and accountability, facilitated by the Democrats running the committee the past four years. He added that the Trump administration was \"not probably the most transparent in the history of America,\" but was \"pretty darn impressive, unfortunately\" compared to the Biden team.\n\nHe said that the current administration has sent considerably fewer Cabinet secretaries to testify before the oversight committee.\n\nDuring the tense wrangling among House Republicans over electing Kevin McCarthy to be speaker of the chamber earlier this month, hard-line conservatives made demands for key committee appointments, and the composition of Mr Comer's oversight committee is evidence of their success.\n\nRight-wing firebrands, including Marjorie Taylor Greene, Paul Gosar, Lauren Boebert and Scott Perry have seats on the powerful committee.\n\nDemocrats have countered with some of their own most aggressive and outspoken legislators, such as Jamie Raskin, who led Donald Trump's second impeachment trial, Dan Golden, who served as lead counsel during Mr Trump's first impeachment hearings, New York's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Maxwell Frost, the newly elected 26-year-old congressman from Florida.\n\nIt sets up what could be contentious proceedings, as both sides jockey to control how the committee's work is viewed by the press and public.\n\n\"There are going to be a lot of debates, and it's going to be very politically charged, very intense,\" Mr Frost told the political news website Axios. \"But I ran on being a fighter, so I'm ready for it.\"\n\nMr Comer, for his part, pledged to offer balanced leadership for the committee, citing his vote to certify Mr Biden's presidential victory in January 2021 as evidence that he is willing to make decisions that may anger his conservative constituents and fellow Republicans.\n\n\"There's going to be a lot written that says this committee is partisan or whatever,\" he said. \"I believe I've demonstrated I'll do what I think is right and what I think is best.\"\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Michael Cohen: Takeaways from testimony of Trump's ex-lawyer\n\nMichael Cohen is unleashing a series of explosive accusations directed towards Donald Trump touching on multiple controversies that have bedevilled the president during his time in office. Here are five takeaways from his dramatic testimony to Congress.\n\nMr Cohen suggests the president had advance knowledge of his son's June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians and that WikiLeaks was poised to release damaging information about Democrats.\n\nHe says the president personally signed cheques reimbursing him for a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. He alleges that the president was fully aware of ongoing negotiations for a Trump Tower in Moscow well into the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nAll the latest from the hearing\n\nMany of these assertions rely almost exclusively on Cohen's word - the word of a man who has already admitted to lying to Congress and to the federal government on his taxes. What's more, while his allegations are certainly politically damaging, they aren't incontrovertible evidence of legal misconduct by the president.\n\nIf there is a case to be made against Mr Trump, it will have to rely on more than the word of his former lawyer and fixer.\n\nThat's not to undersell the blockbuster nature of the day's proceedings, however. The public now has a chance to determine, under the glare of the spotlight, whether Cohen lied in the past to protect the president or is lying now to protect himself.\n\nOr, perhaps, a bit of both.\n\nMost of the early attention paid to Michael Cohen's testimony involved his connections to the assortment of controversies that have swirled around Mr Trump since he became president.\n\nIt's one thing to read the advance text of a committee statement, however, and it's another to see it in the flesh. If there were any doubts about how effective Cohen would be as a witness, he quickly put them to rest.\n\nCohen - in a dark suit, with his voice occasionally wavering - testified about what it was like to work with Mr Trump for more than a decade. What he learned, he said, made him ashamed.\n\nHe called his former boss a racist, a cheat and a conman. He says he had both good and bad attributes, but that bad outweighed the good.\n\n\"Since taking office,\" Cohen said, \"he has become the worst version of himself.\"\n\nRepublicans were quick to pounce. Mark Meadows asked why, if Cohen was so ashamed, he stuck with Mr Trump for 10 full years. Wasn't it a possibility, he suggested, that Cohen was bitter that he didn't get a White House job and was taking it out on his former boss?\n\n\"I got exactly what I wanted,\" Cohen replied, noting that he preferred to spend his time in New York, with his teenage children.\n\nThat may have been the case two years ago, but there's little chance Cohen wanted - or imagined - the situation he finds himself in now.\n\nDemocrats on the House Oversight and Reform Committee have repeatedly hit on what could be the most legally damaging part of Cohen's testimony on Wednesday.\n\nMr Trump's former lawyer has presented new, documentary evidence of payments made to him by Mr Trump - including a cheque with the president's signature. He says this money was a reimbursement for his 2016 election eve hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels. The adult film star was poised to claim that she and Mr Trump had sexual relations in the 2006.\n\nUS government prosecutors in New York have said that Mr Cohen's payment to Daniels constituted an undisclosed campaign contribution in violation of federal election law - a charge to which Cohen has pleaded guilty.\n\nIf Cohen can help draw a connection between the Daniels payment and the president himself, it could implicate Mr Trump in a crime.\n\nThe president's legal team has responded to similar allegations in the past by arguing that the payments to Cohen were part of a retainer fee and that Mr Trump had no knowledge of Cohen's illegal activities and was relying on his lawyer to know and abide by campaign finance law.\n\nThe more evidence Cohen presents to back up his claim that Mr Trump was fully aware of the hush-money payments, the more difficult it becomes for him to maintain this position.\n\nThe Republican strategy for responding to Cohen's testimony has been clear from the beginning. They want to paint the former lawyer as a convicted liar who can't be trusted on any count.\n\nThey're less concerned about rebutting the individual allegations - about Trump Tower, Russia business dealings, hush-money payments or WikiLeaks revelations - than they are in dismissing Cohen's testimony as the work of an untruthful man being put forward by enemies of the president for political purposes.\n\nCongressman Paul Gosar went so far as to hold up a large sign with \"Liar, Liar, Pants on Fire!!\" emblazoned over a picture of the witness.\n\nCohen has tried to parry these charges multiple ways. One is to claim that he has come to the realisation, after Mr Trump's performance as president, of how damaging his support of his former boss has been.\n\nHe cited the Charlottesville violence, the Helsinki summit with Vladimir Putin and the president's coarseness on Twitter as prime examples. That could be a tough sell, however, given the litany of allegations Cohen has levelled against Mr Trump that predate his time as president.\n\nA more effective counter has been when Cohen has tried to hold himself up as a cautionary tale - that he is making amends because his life has come crashing down and not the other way around.\n\n\"I protected Trump for 10 years,\" he told the committee. \"The more people that follow Mr Trump as I did blindly are going to suffer the same consequences that I'm suffering.\"\n\nHe called himself the \"picture perfect example of what not to do\".\n\nCohen isn't going to convince many that he's a saint or a sympathetic figure. When he's been his most effective on Wednesday is when he hasn't tried to.\n\nDonald Trump wrapped up his day in Vietnam around the time Cohen began his congressional committee testimony. After a lavish dinner of chilled shrimp, grilled steaks and \"chocolate lava cake\" with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, he returned to his hotel room, where if past history is any guide, he probably reviewed the day's news coverage.\n\nWhat he saw couldn't have made him happy. US media - including his favourite, Fox News - are giving the Cohen hearings wall-to-wall coverage. The president's second summit with Mr Kim, being billed as \"historic\" by the White House, has been relegated to a secondary story.\n\nThat might change on Thursday, when the two leaders hold a joint press event where they could announce the results of their negotiations. But for one day at least his former lawyer - who he once said was a \"fine man with a wonderful family\" and later called a \"rat\" - held the national stage.\n\nCohen has given Democrats on the Oversight and Reform Committee a number of threads to pursue in further hearings and investigations. It isn't a stretch to imagine that portions of his testimony could someday be cited by Democrats as evidence for impeachment hearings.\n\nIn addition Cohen hinted at other potential presidential wrongdoing and illegalities - including a conversation with the president in June 2018 - that he couldn't discuss because they are currently being investigated by US attorneys in New York.\n\nThe president is half a world away, but the fallout from Cohen's day on Capitol Hill - a day when Cohen called the president a racist, a conman and a cheat, and Republicans called Cohen a liar - will be waiting for him when he gets home.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

In 2018, she became one of the first Muslim women elected to the US Congress.\n\nShe has received well-publicised abuse during her time in office - and supporters of former President Donald Trump have previously chanted \"send her back!\" at his rallies.\n\nBefore the vote on Thursday, Ms Omar said another death threat had been sent to her office. \"These threats increase whenever Republicans put a target on my back,\" she said.\n\nHer conviction brings an end to the years-long legal saga against her and her husband, former Senator Robert Menendez.\n\nThe budget, which now must be merged with the Senate's bill, would cut taxes by about $5 trln.\n\nWith a 218 to 213 majority in the House, Republicans cannot afford to lose winnable elections - let alone slam dunks.\n\nLove made history when she was voted into the House of Representatives for Utah, but was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2022.\n\nSome Democrats have openly criticised the Senate Minority Leader as the party debates how to oppose Trump.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Paul Gosar and stripped him of his committee assignments for posting an anime video that depicted him killing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and swinging swords at President Joe Biden.\n\nThe resolution passed in a 223-207-1 vote. Only two Republicans joined every Democrat in voting for the measure.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said ahead of the vote that Gosar's \"actions demand a response.\"\n\n\"Death threats against a member of Congress and a president of the United States in an animated video does not make those death threats any less real or less serious,\" Pelosi said on the House floor.\n\n\"This is an insult to the institution of the House of Representatives,\" she continued. \"It is not just about us as members of Congress, it is a danger that represents to everyone in the country.\"\n\nGosar is just the 24th House member censured in the chamber's history and the first in more than a decade.\n\nCensure is the harshest formal punishment in the House short of expulsion . It requires a simple majority in a floor vote to pass.\n\nHouse lawmakers also voted to remove Gosar from his assignments on the House Oversight and Reform Committee and the House Natural Resources Committee. Ocasio-Cortez also serves on the Oversight and Reform Committee.\n\nHouse rules required Gosar, an Arizona Republican, to stand on the House floor while Pelosi read the rebuke aloud. Ocasio-Cortez sat with colleagues on the Democratic side of the chamber while the speaker read that Gosar was censured and removed from his committee assignments.\n\nEarlier this year, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., was removed from her committee assignments for spreading hateful and violent conspiracy theories.\n\nGosar had shared the edited video on his official social media channels last week.\n\nIt featured a scene from Japanese anime series \"Attack on Titan,\" with Gosar's face superimposed on a character bearing two swords and attacking giant characters that had the superimposed faces of Ocasio-Cortez and Biden. The video also included images of Border Patrol officers with migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe video, which was shared to Instagram and Twitter, has since been deleted.\n\nFollowing sharp criticism from Democrats on the House floor, Gosar did not apologize for the video and insisted that it was metaphor for immigration policy.\n\n\"I do not espouse violence towards anyone. I never have. It was not my purpose to make anyone upset,\" Gosar said on the House floor ahead of the vote, adding that he rejects what he called a \"false narrative\" that the video encourages violence.\n\nGosar claimed the video represents the \"policy battle regarding amnesty for tens of millions of illegal aliens,\" which he said is a provision included in Biden's \"reckless\" economic package.\n\n\"Our country is suffering from the plague of illegal immigration,\" he said on the House floor.\n\nGosar claimed \"there is no threat in the cartoon other than the threat that immigration poses to our country.\"\n\nGosar also misrepresented the warning label Twitter put on the video after he posted it. He falsely claimed that the video was removed because Twitter thought it was \"in the public interest for it to remain.\"\n\nThe resolution to censure Gosar for the video was first introduced by Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., a co-chair of the Democratic Women's Caucus, and nine other Democratic lawmakers.\n\nThe group drew a connection between Gosar's video and the Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump, saying that \"depictions of violence can foment actual violence and jeopardize the safety of elected officials, as witnessed in this chamber on Jan. 6, 2021.\"\n\nAhead of the final vote Wednesday, Speier slammed Republicans' inaction, noting that House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy was silent on the matter for eight days.\n\n\"Silence speaks volumes. Silence normalizes violence,\" Speier said.\n\nMcCarthy opposed censuring Gosar and removing him from his committee assignments. Rather than condemning Gosar over the video, McCarthy said the move to censure him was the \"definition of abuse of power.\"\n\nMcCarthy cautioned that Republicans might also censure Democrats or take away their committee assignments if they win back the House majority.\n\n\"The speaker is burning down the House on her way out the door,\" McCarthy said ahead of the final vote. \"Let me be clear. I do not condone violence, and Rep. Gosar has echoed that sentiment.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez also condemned McCarthy's inaction and remarks.\n\n\"It is a sad day in which a member who leads a political party in the United States of America cannot bring themselves to say that issuing a depiction of murdering a member of Congress is wrong,\" Ocasio-Cortez said on the House floor.\n\n\"What is so hard about saying that this is wrong?\" Ocasio-Cortez asked.\n\nShe added: \"This is not about me. This is not about Rep. Gosar. But this is about what we are willing to accept.\"\n\nMost Republican members have been silent on the video. But at least two, Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, expressed support for the resolution prior to Wednesday's vote.\n\nCheney and Kinzinger are the only Republican members of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 riots.\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press last week, Cheney said Gosar should be censured for his \"continued indefensible activities.\" She also criticized McCarthy for his initial silence, calling it a \"real symbol of his lack of strength.\"\n\n\"In a moment where you've got an avowed white nationalist in Rep. Gosar who has posted a video advocating the killing of another member, the idea that our leader will not stand against that but that he's somehow going after and allowing attacks against 13 members who are conducting themselves in a serious and substantive way is really outrageous,\" Cheney told the AP.\n\nHer statement referred to the 13 GOP lawmakers who voted for the bipartisan infrastructure bill, who have faced backlash from their Republican colleagues and even death threats from the public because of their votes.\n\nKinzinger also said he would vote yes on the censure resolution.\n\n\"We have to hold Members accountable who incite or glorify violence, who spread and perpetuate dangerous conspiracies. The failure to do so will take us one step closer to this fantasized violence becoming real,\" Kinzinger said in a Twitter post Tuesday.\n\nGosar, who was one of the 147 Republicans who voted to overturn the 2020 presidential election results, has a history of engaging with white nationalist groups.\n\nIn February, he attended a white nationalist conference hosted by America First leader Nick Fuentes, who is known for pushing racist and antisemitic rhetoric.\n\nFollowing the event, Gosar attempted to distance himself from Fuentes and his speaking engagement, telling The Washington Post that he denounces \"white racism\" and that he attended the event to reach a younger conservative voter base.\n\nIn late 2019, Gosar also attended a \"Trumpstock\" rally in Golden Valley, which featured QAnon speakers and supporters.\n\nHe has also continually pushed conspiracy theories about the deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville in 2017 and the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, calling the rioters \"political prisoners.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., to serve on committees again after Democrats stripped them of that privilege in 2021, according to a member of the GOP Steering Committee, which doles out the spots.\n\nGreene has been assigned to the House Committee on Homeland Security, which Republicans will use to focus on border security and investigate Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Last week, a House Republican from Texas filed articles of impeachment against the Cabinet member.\n\nGosar, meanwhile, has been assigned to the House Committee on Natural Resources, where he had served before his removal, the member said. CNN previously reported the assignments.\n\nIn February 2021, the House, then controlled by Democrats, voted to remove Greene from the Budget Committee and House Education and Labor Committee after her social media posts had revealed she was spreading dangerous and racist conspiracy theories .\n\nMore from NBC News:\n\nThe Democratic majority chose to pursue a proposal to remove Greene from her committees after House Republican leaders opted not to take action against Greene. A freshman lawmaker at the time, Greene had come under fire for having expressed support for the QAnon conspiracy theory, embracing calls for violence against top Democrats and suggesting that the Sandy Hook and Parkland school shootings were staged.\n\nLater that year, in November, the House voted to remove Gosar from his two committees - Oversight and Reform, and Natural Resources - after he posted an animated video that depicted him killing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and attacking President Joe Biden. As part of the measure, Gosar was censured, which is considered the harshest punishment against a member in the House, after expulsion.\n\nCurrent House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., had delivered a veiled threat before the vote to remove Gosar, warning Democrats that if Republicans won control of the House in the 2022 election, Democrats' seats on committees might not be safe.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

Jackie Speier, D-Calif., a co-chair of the Democratic Women's Caucus, and nine other lawmakers. They group said such violent images increase threats against elected officials in the wake of the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"For that Member to post such a video on his official Instagram account and use his official congressional resources in the House of Representatives to further violence against elected officials goes beyond the pale,\" the group of House Democrats said in a Wednesday statement announcing their plans to introduce the motion.\n\n\"As the events of January 6th have shown, such vicious and vulgar messaging can and does foment actual violence,\" they continued.\n\nCensure is the second harshest form of punishment in the House short of expulsion, and requires a simple majority in a floor vote to pass. Twenty-three lawmakers have been censured by the House since 1832.\n\nIt would require Gosar, an Arizona Republican, to stand in the center of the House chamber as the resolution condemning his conduct is read aloud.\n\nThe edited video was shared on Gosar's official social media channels Sunday evening.\n\nIt featured a scene from the Japanese anime series \"Attack on Titan,\" with Gosar's face edited onto a character bearing two swords and subsequently attacking giant characters superimposed with Ocasio-Cortez and Biden's faces.

He released a statement Tuesday that confirmed his office produced the video and accused detractors of \"gross mischaracterization.\"\n\n\"I do not espouse violence or harm towards any Member of Congress or Mr. Biden,\" Gosar said in the statement\n\nHe added that the video \"symbolizes the battle for the soul of America\" when Congress takes up the president's economic package, which he said includes immigration provisions he opposes.\n\n\"This video is truly a symbolic portrayal of a fight over immigration policy,\" Gosar said in the statement.\n\n\"It is a symbolic cartoon.

      "text": "Trump and GOP Rep. Gosar suggest Joint Chiefs boss Mark Milley deserves death\n\nWASHINGTON - Former President Donald Trump and Republican Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona suggested that outgoing Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley is a traitor who deserves to be executed.\n\nTrump blasted Milley, an Army general, in a social media post Friday that accused Milley of going behind his back by making phone calls to Chinese counterparts in the final months of Trump's administration.\n\n\"If the Fake News reporting is correct, [Milley] was actually dealing with China to give them a heads up on the thinking of the President of the United States,\" Trump wrote in the post on his Truth Social site.\n\n\"This is an act so egregious that, in times gone by, the punishment would have been death!\"\n\n\"A war between China and the United States could have been the result of this treasonous act,\" wrote Trump, who by a wide margin is leading in polls of 2024 GOP presidential nomination contenders.\n\nMilley in September 2021 told Congress he had made it clear to Chinese officials that Trump was not planning to attack China in his final weeks as president.\n\n\"My task at that time was to de-escalate,\" Milley told the Senate Armed Services Committee. \"My message again was consistent: Stay calm, steady, and de-escalate. We are not going to attack you.\"\n\nGosar in a newsletter published Sunday accused Milley of coordinating with then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., \"to hurt President Trump, and treasonously working behind Trump's back\" by purportedly delaying National Guard assistance to the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6, 2021, riot.\n\n\"In a better society, quislings like the strange sodomy-promoting General Milley would be hung,\" Gosar wrote.\n\nGosar also called Milley, a four-star general with more than four decades of military service, a \"traitor.\"\n\nA spokesman for Milley, who is stepping down as Joint Chiefs chairman at the end of September, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.\n\nPelosi, when asked about Trump's comments on Monday night by MSNBC's Jen Psaki, said, \"To engage in language like that should be something that would eliminate somebody as a prospect for any public office.\"\n\nTrump while president regularly dressed down military officials, calling Milley a \" dumbass \" in 2021 and former Secretary of Defense James Mattis \"the world's most overrated general.\"\n\nIn 2020, The Atlantic reported that Trump declined to visit an American cemetery near Paris in 2018, and referred to U.S. Marines buried there as \"losers\" and \"suckers.\"\n\n\"Why should I go to that cemetery? It's filled with losers,\" Trump reportedly told aides after scrapping the visit to Aisne-Marne American Cemetery.\n\nThe report said Trump later referred to the more than 1,800 Marines who lost their lives in the Battle of Belleau Wood in France as \"suckers\" for getting killed.\n\nThe 1918 battle dragged on for 20 days and ended with Marines successfully clearing out German camps.

      "text": "Republicans take the rare step of censuring Rep. Adam Schiff over Trump-era probes\n\nThe House on Wednesday took the rare step of censuring one of its own members, Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, over his criticisms of then-President Donald Trump and his role in leading the first impeachment inquiry into the former president.\n\nThe 213-209 party-line vote came exactly one week after a similar effort to censure Schiff was rejected after 20 Republicans joined Democrats to block the resolution over objections to a provision that called for fining the California Democrat $16 million.\n\nBut the author of the resolution, freshman Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., said this week she had secured support from the 20 GOP dissenters after she removed language about a fine.\n\nMore from NBC News: McCarthy urges Republicans to reject quick Biden impeachment vote Modi's White House visit highlights deep diaspora divides Hunter Biden plea deal sparks political fight over independence of the justice system\n\nSchiff will now be ordered to stand on the House floor to receive a verbal rebuke. The resolution also requires the House Ethics Committee to launch an investigation into Schiff.\n\n\"The perpetrator of this web of deceit became mainstays on cable news, waking up every morning with one goal: to lie, lie, lie to the American people that there was direct evidence of Russia collusion,\" Luna said in a floor speech before the vote.\n\nThen-special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation did not establish any coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia, though it did document contacts between Russians and campaign officials and found that the campaign was willing to accept help.\n\nDemocrats chanted \"Shame!\" and \"Disgrace!\" on the House floor after the vote. Schiff, who is running for an open Senate seat in California, served as the chairman and ranking member of the Intelligence Committee during the Trump administration and became the face of Democratic accusations that members of Trump's 2016 campaign colluded with Russia to defeat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn January, Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., a top Trump ally, single-handedly removed Schiff and Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., from the Intelligence panel.\n\n\"I think once Donald Trump threatened that any Republicans who didn't go along with his effort to censure me were going to get primaried, they fell in line ... They just cannot stand up to this most unethical, now-indicted president,\" a defiant Schiff told reporters on the steps of the Capitol before Wednesday's vote.\n\n\"As [Franklin D.] Roosevelt said, sometimes you can judge a person by the enemies they make,\" he added. \"Judging from the kind of crazy people that were on the floor today in support of this resolution, I'm doing really well measured by that standard.\"\n\nCensure represents the House's formal disapproval of a lawmaker's misconduct. But even amid today's political polarization, censure doesn't happen very often.\n\nSchiff is the 25th lawmaker in U.S. history to be censured by the House. Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., a Trump ally and member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, was censured on Nov. 17, 2021 , for posting an animation on Twitter depicting him killing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and attacking President Joe Biden.\n\nBefore that, the last censure occurred more than a decade earlier. On Dec. 2, 2010, the House censured then-Ways and Means Chairman Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y., for a variety of ethics violations including misusing congressional letterhead for fundraising and filing inaccurate financial reports and federal tax returns.\n\nDemocrats, particularly those who worked closely with Schiff on the Intelligence panel, defended the former committee chairman, both in floor speeches and interviews.\n\n\"Adam Schiff did his job. He spoke the truth, and he held Donald Trump accountable,\" Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., said in an interview. \"And demagogues like Donald Trump don't like that. They don't like people calling them out.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Republicans vote to remove Rep. Ilhan Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee\n\nHouse Republicans voted Thursday to oust Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., from the Foreign Affairs Committee - the latest skirmish in a long-running partisan battle over committee assignments .\n\nSpeaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., had faced a handful of GOP defections, but by Thursday he and his team had whipped GOP members back in line, and 218 Republicans voted to back the resolution condemning Omar for past antisemitic comments and removing her from the committee.\n\nOne Republican, Dave Joyce of Ohio, a senior member of the Ethics Committee, voted present.\n\nAll 211 Democrats unified behind Omar, who gave an emotional and defiant floor speech before the vote that left many of her colleagues in tears.\n\n\"There is this idea that you are a suspect if you are an immigrant or if you are from certain parts of the world or a certain skin tone or a Muslim. It is no accident that members of the Republican Party accused the first Black president, Barack Obama, of being a secret Muslim,\" said Omar, a Somali refugee who made history as one of the first two Muslim American women elected to Congress.\n\n\"Well, I am Muslim,\" she added. \"I am an immigrant and, interestingly, from Africa. Is anyone surprised that I am being targeted? Is anyone surprised that I am somehow deemed unworthy to speak about American foreign policy? Or that they see me as a powerful voice that needs to be silenced?\"\n\nMore from NBC News:\n\nRepublicans defended their action, arguing that the antisemitic comments Omar made several years ago disqualified her from serving on the Foreign Affairs Committee. In 2019, Omar infuriated Democrats and Republicans alike - as well as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - when she tweeted that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and other Jewish donors were paying politicians to back Israel, saying: \"It's all about the Benjamins, baby.\"\n\nShe also came under fire from fellow Democrats after they said she had equated the \"United States and Israel to Hamas and the Taliban.\"\n\n\"How can someone not welcomed by one of our most important allies serve as an emissary of American foreign policy on the Foreign Affairs Committee?\" said Rep. Max Miller, R-Ohio, a former Trump White House aide who is Jewish and who authored Thursday's resolution. \"And given her biased comments against Israel and against the Jewish people, how can she serve as an objective decision-maker on the committee?\"\n\nOthers argued that Democrats took similar actions two years ago when they voted to oust two Republicans from their committees over racist and violent social media posts. Then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., blocked two other Republicans from serving on the select Jan. 6 panel.\n\nThose comments infuriated one of Omar's closest allies, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who had been targeted in a social media post by Rep. Paul Gosar , R-Ariz., and who took to the floor Thursday to rail against Republicans.\n\n\"Consistency? There is nothing consistent with the Republican Party's continued attacks, except for the racism and incitement of violence against women of color in this body,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"I had a member of the Republican caucus threaten my life, and you all - and the Republican caucus rewarded him with one of the most prestigious committee assignments in this Congress.\"\n\nThe vote to remove Omar almost didn't happen. Last week, several Republicans voiced opposition to the GOP's taking action against Omar, threatening to derail the resolution given their new, razor-thin majority.\n\nBut this week, the defectors began to fall in line. On Tuesday, Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind., flipped her vote to yes after a meeting with McCarthy and language was added to the Omar resolution that would give lawmakers a chance to appeal removal from committees.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who was on the fence, said he would back the resolution. On Wednesday, Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., said he would change his vote to yes after having talked to McCarthy, saying the speaker appeared open to a proposed rule change that would make it harder to kick lawmakers off committees.\n\nMoments before the vote, Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina, the lone GOP holdout, emerged from McCarthy's office and announced she would also vote yes. Mace said she got a commitment from McCarthy to develop a better process to remove members from committees.\n\n\"We have a process today for [censure]. We have a process today to expel members from the Congress,\" Mace told reporters. \"We don't have a process to remove members from their committee.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the vote, McCarthy said he had just spoken with Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., about appointing members of both parties to a working group that would come up with a proposal spelling out the reasons lawmakers could be removed from committees and the process for doing it. McCarthy said he would appoint Mace and Buck.\n\n\"Moving forward, every single member of Congress has a responsibility to how they carry themselves. And it's responsible upon us to let them know what that is,\" he said.\n\n\"So I'm going to put a group of Democrats that Hakeem will select and a group of Republicans, and we'll work to clarify the rules and pass something for not only this Congress but future Congresses, as well.\"\n\nMcCarthy argued that the House's action didn't amount to a \"tit-for-tat\" against Democrats - Republicans will allow Omar to serve on other committees, he said.\n\nBut Omar's ouster is just the latest example of how both parties have used committee assignments in the past two years to punish lawmakers who cross the line.\n\nIt started in February 2021, when House Democrats - and 11 Republicans - voted to boot far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., from two committees for past social media posts that spread racist and antisemitic conspiracy theories and threatened violence against Pelosi and Obama.\n\nMonths later, Democrats also moved to censure and oust Gosar from his two committees after he tweeted an animated video depicting him killing Ocasio-Cortez and attacking President Joe Biden.\n\nThe same year, Pelosi unilaterally blocked two of McCarthy's picks - Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Jim Banks, R-Ind. - from the select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol; McCarthy and Republicans then boycotted the special panel.\n\nAt the time, Republicans warned that Democrats would regret those decisions. When Republicans took back control of the House this year, they immediately reinstated Greene and Gosar to committees.\n\nMcCarthy then blocked two of Jeffries' picks for the Intelligence Committee: former Chairman Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell, both California Democrats who played key roles in the Trump impeachment proceedings.\n\nAnd on Thursday, McCarthy made good on his promise to boot Omar from the Foreign Affairs panel, as well.\n\n\"Rep. Omar certainly has made mistakes. She has used antisemitic tropes that were clearly and unequivocally condemned by House Democrats when it took place four years ago,\" Jeffries told reporters.\n\nBut he called Thursday's vote \"not a public policy debate,\" adding: \"It's not about accountability. It's about political revenge.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Anxiety in an aging Congress as coronavirus marches across US\n\nMembers of Congress are becoming increasingly anxious about coronavirus, and there is growing pressure on leadership to take steps to protect lawmakers - even potentially recessing for a period of weeks - two Democratic congressional sources said Sunday.\n\nMultiple sources said anxiety was on the rise among lawmakers as more cases are reported and the virus spreads.\n\nRep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., said he will close his office in Washington and will self-quarantine at home in Arizona for 14 days after he came into \"extended\" contact with a person who is hospitalized with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. They came into contact at the recent Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland, Gosar said.\n\n@RepGosar: My statement on #COVID19\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, announced late Sunday that he will stay home in Texas this week because he had a brief interaction with a person attending CPAC who has tested positive.\n\nGosar and Cruz said they were experiencing no symptoms but were acting out of caution.\n\n\"Members are very nervous,\" a senior Democratic leadership aide said. \"There's a lot of concern that members could bring it home.\"\n\nAnother source said members from districts and states where the virus is spreading are also concerned about being able to remain at home to help handle the crisis.\n\nMore from NBC News: 4 French MPs hospitalized with coronavirus; large public gatherings banned nationwide Fauci: Those 'vulnerable' to coronavirus should limit travel and crowd exposure Mixed White House messaging on coronavirus sparks internal frustration\n\nMembers plan to raise concerns with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., at their weekly leadership meeting Monday afternoon, two sources said. It's Pelosi's decision whether to keep the House in session or make changes in the schedule.\n\nA spokesman for Pelosi's office didn't respond to requests for comment Sunday night.\n\nThe House is scheduled to resume meeting this week after a weekend at home. Several offices said that by Sunday evening, there were no changes to the schedule. Members are expecting an update on the coronavirus at their usual caucus meeting Tuesday morning at the Capitol.\n\nAnd some members were urging Congress to stay the course to \"show leadership in a time of great anxiety\" and conduct oversight of the Trump administration's response.\n\nMembers should \"follow the very advice we're giving the country: wash our hands, avoid contact with anyone exhibiting symptoms, stay home if we're sick and ensure our staffs are doing the same,\" one lawmaker told NBC News.\n\nBut the virus is spreading rapidly, and the first case in Washington, D.C., was announced Saturday night.\n\nThe Capitol building is open to scheduled public tours - tourists travel from all over the world to visit, and the Capitol Hill office buildings are open to members of the public, who can freely walk the hallways as long as they pass through a basic magnetometer screening.\n\nPelosi so far has been careful not to sound alarmist and has continued to rely on the advice of the Capitol physician in making decisions about the grounds. The top four congressional leaders in both parties - Sens. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Pelosi and Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. - met with top Capitol building staff to discuss the coronavirus last week.\n\nPelosi told reporters Thursday: \"You cannot test everybody who comes in the front door of the Capitol.\n\n\"It is unreasonable and probably in some ways not focused enough on what needs to be focused on,\" she said, adding that the office of the Capitol physician would be making the decisions on protocols.\n\nCongress as a whole could be more susceptible to dangerous symptoms of the coronavirus than the public in general. Sixty-six senators are over age 60 - two-thirds of the body - with more than a quarter over 70. The average age of House members is 57.6 years, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nMany members \"are concerned, particularly older members and a number who have conditions that make them more susceptible,\" a source said.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
